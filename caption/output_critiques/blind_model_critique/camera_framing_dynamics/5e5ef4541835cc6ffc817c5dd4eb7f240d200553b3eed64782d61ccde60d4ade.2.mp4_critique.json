    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation**\n\nThe caption is good and mostly accurate, but it contains one key error regarding the camera angle.\n\n*   **Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n    *   **Correct:** The description of the **camera height** (\"ground level\"), **focus** (\"focusing on the wolf in the foreground using a shallow depth of field\"), and **camera movement** (\"fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\") are all perfectly accurate. The camera is indeed very low, the background is blurred, and there is a subtle hand-held shake rather than a deliberate pan or tilt.\n    *   **Incorrect:** The **camera angle** is described as \"level angle,\" which is inaccurate. Because the camera is positioned below the wolf's eye line and looking slightly upward at its face, the correct term is **low angle**. A level angle would be positioned directly at the subject's eye level.\n\n*   **Completeness: Excellent**\n    *   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects present in the video according to the instructions: camera height, angle, movement, and focus.\n    *   It correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none of these are present, adhering to the instruction for conciseness.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions: Very Good**\n    *   The caption is concise and informative, as requested.\n    *   It correctly identifies and describes the key camera configuration elements.\n    *   The only failure in adherence is the inaccurate description of the camera angle.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is well-written and captures most of the technical details correctly. Its only flaw is misidentifying the camera angle.\n\n### **Improved Caption**\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the error:\n\n\"Positioned at ground level with a **low angle**, the camera focuses on the wolf in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. The shot is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\"",
