    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward, moving up, and moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It is concise and correctly identifies several key technical aspects, such as the focus and the complex camera movement. However, it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the camera's height and angle, which creates a logical contradiction.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Focus:** The description \"employs deep focus with a large depth of field\" is accurate. The woman in the midground, the escalator steps, and the ceiling in the background are all relatively sharp.\n    *   **Movement:** The description \"moves smoothly forward, upward, and to the right\" is an excellent and precise summary of the camera's motion. It correctly identifies the three simultaneous translational movements (dollying forward, pedestaling up, and trucking right).\n    *   **Subject and Purpose:** The phrase \"focusing on a woman ascending an escalator\" correctly identifies the subject and the purpose of the camera movement (to track her).\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** The phrase \"a camera at eye level with a low angle\" is contradictory and inaccurate.\n        *   **Height:** The camera is clearly not at eye level. It is positioned much lower, likely at **hip-level or lower**, to achieve the upward-looking perspective.\n        *   **Angle:** While \"low angle\" is correct, stating it's at \"eye level\" undermines this. A low-angle shot is defined by the camera being placed below the subject's eye line and looking up. If the camera were at eye level, it would be a **level angle** shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete according to the instructions.\n\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as **video speed alterations**, **lens distortion**, and a **Dutch angle**, as per the instruction to be concise.\n*   It successfully covers all the relevant, observable elements:\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Mentioned (low angle).\n    *   **Camera Height:** Mentioned (though inaccurately).\n    *   **Movements:** Described in detail (smoothly forward, upward, right).\n    *   **Focus:** Described (deep focus, large depth of field).\n\nThe caption effectively captures the essential technical information without unnecessary fluff.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the instructions' format and intent.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** It is very concise, packing a lot of information into just three sentences.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses appropriate technical terms like \"low angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"depth of field.\"\n*   **Descriptive Detail:** It provides a good level of detail on the camera's movement, breaking it down into its component directions as requested.\n\nThe only failure in adherence is the factual inaccuracy of the camera's height.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracy while maintaining the strengths of the original:\n\n**\"The video is captured from a low angle at approximately hip-level, looking up at a woman on an escalator. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the subject and background sharp. The camera moves smoothly forward, upward, and to the right, tracking the woman as she ascends.\"**",
