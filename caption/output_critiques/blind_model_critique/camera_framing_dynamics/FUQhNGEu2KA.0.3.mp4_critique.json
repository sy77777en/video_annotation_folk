    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the background.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant error and a logical contradiction, making it a **poor** description of the video according to the provided instructions. While it correctly identifies the focus and angle, its fundamental description of the camera's state is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies several key elements:\n    *   **\"level angle\":** The camera is positioned at a level angle, not looking significantly up or down at the scene.\n    *   **\"slight, natural unsteadiness\":** This is an accurate description of the camera's movement. There is a clear, minor wobble consistent with a handheld shot.\n    *   **\"shallow depth of field\":** The background is in focus while the foreground (the back of a person's head and shoulders) is heavily blurred, which is characteristic of a shallow DoF.\n    *   **\"focus set on the person in the background\":** The plane of focus is clearly on the person sitting at the desk in the midground/background.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"This is a static shot...\"**: This is the primary and most significant error. A static shot is completely motionless, as if on a tripod. This video clearly shows handheld movement. The term \"static\" is fundamentally incorrect.\n    *   **Logical Contradiction:** The caption immediately contradicts itself by describing a **\"static shot\"** that also has **\"natural unsteadiness.\"** These two descriptions are mutually exclusive. A shot cannot be both motionless and unsteady at the same time.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The caption mentions the \"level angle\" but omits the **camera height**. According to the instructions, terms like \"eye-level\" or \"hip-level\" should be used. In this case, **\"eye-level\"** would be the most appropriate description.\n    *   **Correct Movement Classification:** Instead of incorrectly labeling it \"static,\" the caption should have simply described it as a **\"handheld shot.\"** This term inherently implies the potential for natural unsteadiness.\n\n*   **What's Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   The caption correctly follows the instruction to omit details about **video speed**, **lens distortion**, and **Dutch angle**, as none of these are present.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which adheres to the instructions.\n*   **Informative Description:** It fails to be fully informative because of the core inaccuracy. The mischaracterization of the shot as \"static\" misleads the viewer about the fundamental nature of the cinematography.\n*   **Applying Terminology:** The caption fails to correctly apply the terminology provided in the instructions. The instructions clearly differentiate between a **static** shot and one with movement (including shaking or wobbling). The caption writer conflated these concepts, leading to the error and contradiction.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a handheld shot from an eye-level, level angle, exhibiting a slight, natural unsteadiness. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus plane fixed on the person in the background, leaving the foreground subject out of focus.\"**\n\n#### Why this version is better:\n\n1.  **Corrects the Error:** It properly identifies the shot as **\"handheld\"** instead of \"static.\"\n2.  **Resolves the Contradiction:** By using \"handheld,\" the \"natural unsteadiness\" becomes an expected characteristic rather than a contradiction.\n3.  **Adds Completeness:** It includes the **\"eye-level\"** camera height for a more complete description.\n4.  **Improves Clarity:** It explicitly states the focus is **\"fixed\"** and clarifies that the **\"foreground subject [is] out of focus,\"** which adds precision to the description of the depth of field.",
