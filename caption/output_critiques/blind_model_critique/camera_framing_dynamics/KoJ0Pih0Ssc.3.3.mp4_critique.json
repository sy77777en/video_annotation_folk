    "pre_caption": "From a low, hip-level angle, the camera focuses on two red, stylized figures in the foreground, using a shallow depth of field that blurs the building behind them. The camera moves slowly and smoothly from left to right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation by identifying the subject, camera height, and shallow depth of field, but it lacks the technical precision and detail that could fully describe the shot. The movement described as \"from left to right\" would be more accurately termed a \"slow, smooth truck right.\" It would also be beneficial to describe the purpose or compositional effect of this movement—for instance, the truck right might serve to shift the figures from the left of the frame to the center, gradually revealing more of the architectural backdrop. While \"low, hip-level angle\" is descriptive, specifying it as a \"low angle shot from hip-level\" would be more precise, especially since the camera appears to be tilted slightly upward to emphasize the scale of the figures. The description could also be enhanced by noting any lens characteristics; for example, the wide perspective suggests a lens that creates slight barrel distortion, noticeable in the gentle curvature of the background building's vertical lines near the frame's edges. Lastly, while the shallow depth of field is noted, the caption could confirm that the focus plane remains locked on the foreground figures throughout the entire shot, clarifying that no focus tracking or rack focus occurs, and it could also explicitly state that the video plays at regular speed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera captures a low angle shot from hip-level, slightly tilted upward to emphasize the scale of two red, stylized figures in the foreground. Utilizing a shallow depth of field, the focus remains locked on these figures, ensuring the building behind them is artfully blurred. The camera executes a slow, smooth truck right, shifting the figures from the left to the center of the frame, gradually unveiling more of the architectural backdrop. The wide perspective lens introduces slight barrel distortion, noticeable in the gentle curvature of the building's vertical lines near the frame's edges.
