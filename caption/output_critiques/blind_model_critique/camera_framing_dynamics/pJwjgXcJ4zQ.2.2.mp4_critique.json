    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level, initially capturing a low angle before transitioning to a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera tilts down and then moves forward slightly to reveal a broader view of the street, with smooth and steady motion throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts down, then moves forward slightly to reveal a broader view of the street.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, concise, and correctly identifies the most important visual and technical elements of the shot. It successfully adheres to the core principles of the instructions. However, it could be slightly more complete by using more specific terminology for the camera movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in all its statements:\n\n*   **\"The video features a camera at eye level...\"**: Correct. The perspective is consistent with a person of average height holding a camera.\n*   **\"...initially capturing a low angle before transitioning to a level angle.\"**: Correct. The shot begins by looking up at the buildings and sky (low angle) and then adjusts to look straight down the street (level angle).\n*   **\"It employs deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**: Correct. All elements, from the street markings in the immediate foreground to the buildings in the far background, are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"The camera tilts down and then moves forward slightly...\"**: Correct. The first action is a downward tilt, followed by a forward movement.\n*   **\"...to reveal a broader view of the street, with smooth and steady motion throughout.\"**: Correct. The purpose of the movement is clearly a reveal, and the execution is exceptionally smooth, suggesting the use of a gimbal or stabilizer.\n\n#### 2. Completeness and Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption does a great job of being concise and following the negative constraints (i.e., not mentioning normal video speed or the absence of lens distortion). However, it could be slightly more informative by incorporating more specific terms from the instructions.\n\n*   **Movement Terminology:** The instruction provides specific terms like `dollying` (moving forward/backward) and `trucking` (moving left/right). While \"moves forward\" is accurate, using **\"dollies forward\"** would be more precise and demonstrate a fuller understanding of the technical vocabulary requested. The camera also appears to **truck slightly to the right** as it moves forward, a subtle detail that is missed.\n*   **Movement Speed:** The caption notes the motion is \"smooth and steady,\" which implies a controlled speed. Adding the word \"slowly\" would provide more specific information about the pace of the movement.\n*   **Focus:** The description of \"deep focus\" is perfect. It correctly omits any mention of focus changes, as there are none.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback above to be slightly more complete and technically precise, while remaining concise.\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"Shot from eye-level, the camera begins on a low angle before tilting down to a level angle. It then slowly and smoothly dollies forward and trucks slightly right to reveal a wider view of the street. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"",
