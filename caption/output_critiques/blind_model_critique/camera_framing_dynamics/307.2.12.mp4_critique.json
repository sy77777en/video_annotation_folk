    "pre_caption": "This unsteady, eye-level shot begins at a high angle with a varying Dutch angle. The camera slightly pans right, then zooms in to focus on the person's head, which shifts the camera to a level angle. The shot concludes with a pan to the left and a slight zoom-out. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus and a large depth of field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly pans right at first, then zooms in to focus on the person's head with noticeable shaking, ending with a pan to the left and a slight zoom-out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the unsteady, handheld nature of the shot and the presence of a varying Dutch angle. However, there are several inaccuracies in the description of camera movement and focus. The initial description of an \"eye-level shot\" that \"begins at a high angle\" is confusing; it's more likely an eye-level camera filming a subject who is positioned lower, such as someone sitting down, creating the high angle. The most significant error is stating that a \"zoom in\" shifts the camera to a \"level angle.\" A zoom only magnifies the image and does not alter the camera's angle or perspective. Based on the visual, it appears the camera physically *dollies in* (moves forward) toward the person, and simultaneously *tilts up* to reframe their head, which is what changes the shot from a high to a level angle. Similarly, the final \"zoom-out\" is likely a *dolly-out* (moving backward). Lastly, the claim of a \"deep focus and a large depth of field\" throughout is improbable; as the camera moves in for the close-up on the person's head, the depth of field would naturally become much *shallower*, causing the background to blur significantly, which is a key visual element you've missed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The unsteady, handheld shot starts with an eye-level camera capturing a subject positioned lower, creating a high-angle perspective. The camera then dollies in and tilts up to focus on the person's head, transitioning the shot to a level angle. The scene concludes with a pan to the left and a dolly-out, moving backward. Initially, the scene features deep focus and a large depth of field, but as the camera moves closer for the close-up, the depth of field becomes much shallower, causing the background to blur significantly.",
