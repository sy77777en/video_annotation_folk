    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete according to the instructions, and adheres perfectly to the principles of being concise yet informative.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is factually correct in every aspect it describes:\n*   **\"smooth forward-moving camera\"**: This is precise. The camera moves forward at a constant speed with perfect stability, suggesting it's on a gimbal, a vehicle mount, or is a CGI render. \"Smooth\" correctly captures the lack of any shake or wobble.\n*   **\"at eye level\"**: This is an accurate estimation of the camera's height. It mimics the perspective of a person sitting in a car, which is a standard eye-level view for that context.\n*   **\"maintaining a level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is pointed straight ahead, and the horizon is not tilted (no Dutch angle).\n*   **\"employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp\"**: This is the most important and accurate observation. Every part of the image, from the road markings in the immediate foreground to the distant buildings and sky, is in perfect, crisp focus. This is a defining characteristic of the video, and the caption describes it perfectly.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while omitting what is not required, demonstrating a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\n*   **Included (Correctly):**\n    *   **Movement:** \"smooth forward-moving\" covers the type, steadiness, and direction.\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"at eye level, maintaining a level angle\" is a concise and correct description.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is a complete and accurate description of the focus settings.\n\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed. The instructions state, \"if the video is at regular playback speed... there is no need to mention these.\" The caption correctly omits this.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible lens distortion. The caption correctly omits this as per the instructions.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** There is no Dutch angle, so it is correctly not mentioned.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static (deep focus throughout), so there is no need to describe rack focus or focus tracking.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels at following the core principles of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is short and to the point. It avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (\"forward-moving\" instead of \"dollying forward\") but uses precise technical terms where necessary (\"deep focus\").\n*   **Informativeness:** Despite its brevity, it provides a complete picture of the video's technical setup, highlighting its most distinct features (the smooth motion and the deep focus).\n*   **Structure:** It presents the information in a logical flow, starting with the camera's movement and position and then describing its optical properties (focus).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is a perfect description because it is accurate, efficiently comprehensive, and demonstrates a clear understanding of what information is essential versus what is superfluous.",
