    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the man in the midground. Through a smooth rack focus, the focus shifts to the items on the table in the foreground. The camera exhibits minor, smooth zooming in towards the table.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the midground, and later becomes focused on the foreground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a high-quality description that is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the camera's static position (**eye level**, **level angle**).\n*   It correctly describes the focus properties: a **shallow depth of field** is used to isolate subjects, and the focus planes are correctly identified (**midground** and **foreground**).\n*   The dynamic focus change is precisely labeled as a **smooth rack focus**, which is the correct technical term for shifting focus between planes.\n*   The camera movement is correctly identified as a **minor, smooth zoom**, capturing its subtlety and quality.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects requested in the instructions: camera height, angle, focus (depth, plane, and change), and movement.\n*   Crucially, it demonstrates an understanding of the conciseness rule by correctly omitting any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, assuming they are standard/absent. This makes the description efficient and focused on the key visual characteristics of the shot.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Terminology:** The caption uses the precise terminology specified in the instructions (e.g., \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"rack focus,\" \"zooming in\").\n*   **Descriptive Qualities:** It effectively includes qualitative descriptors for movement and focus changes (\"smooth,\" \"minor\"), adding valuable detail as requested.\n*   **Structure and Conciseness:** The description is concise yet highly informative. It is structured logically, first establishing the static camera setup and then describing the dynamic changes (focus shift and zoom) that occur during the shot.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, well-structured, and includes all the necessary information without any unnecessary fluff.",
