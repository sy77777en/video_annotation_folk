    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera captures the zoo scenery ahead, slightly panning and trucking right with a brief pause in between.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, demonstrating a strong understanding of both the video's technical aspects and the requirements of the prompt.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical elements.\n\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It correctly identifies the camera as **handheld**, **eye-level**, and at a **level angle**. This is evident from the slight natural sway and the perspective relative to the ground and subjects.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement as a smooth **pan and truck to the right** is precise. The camera is physically moving sideways (trucking) while also rotating slightly (panning) to keep the enclosure centered. The mention of a **brief pause** is also a keen and accurate observation.\n*   **Focus:** The term **deep focus** is used correctly. Both the deer in the foreground/midground and the enclosure details in the background are sharp and in focus, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **Steadiness:** The description **\"steady with minimal shaking\"** is a perfect characterization. The movement is clearly handheld, but the operator has kept the camera very stable.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information required by the instructions without adding superfluous details.\n\n*   **Required Elements:** It covers camera height, angle, movement types (translation and rotation), movement purpose (\"to capture the zoo enclosure\"), steadiness, and focus depth.\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):** As per the instructions, it correctly omits mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is at a regular, real-time speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible barrel or fisheye distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** There are no rack focuses or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot.\n\nBy including only the relevant, non-default attributes, the caption remains concise and informative.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the formatting and stylistic guidelines of the prompt exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** It condenses a significant amount of technical information into two clear, well-structured sentences.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions (e.g., \"trucks,\" \"pans,\" \"eye level,\" \"deep focus\").\n*   **Descriptive Quality:** It doesn't just list terms; it uses descriptive adverbs like \"smoothly\" and phrases like \"briefly pausing\" to paint a clear picture of the camera's action.\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the movement is easy to understand, and the explanation for the deep focus (\"ensures both the deer... and the background... remain sharp\") adds valuable context.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a perfect execution of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and concise by omitting unnecessary information. It demonstrates a thorough analysis of the video and a complete understanding of the captioning requirements.",
