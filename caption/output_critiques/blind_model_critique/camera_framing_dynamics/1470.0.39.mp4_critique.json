    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It then transitions to a low angle, looking up at the person holding a book. The camera is at a varying Dutch angle due to gentle rolling. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly moves forward, slightly tilting up to focus on the person's face, with a gentle counter-clockwise roll.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera gradually moves forward while slightly tilting up to focus on the person's face, accompanied by gentle counter-clockwise rolling.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it correctly identifies some elements, it is inaccurate and incomplete because it fails to distinguish between the two separate shots in the video, leading to incorrect generalizations.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its flaws:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Generalizations:** The caption's biggest flaw is that it describes the video as a single, continuous shot. It is actually two distinct shots separated by a hard cut. This leads to major inaccuracies:\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The caption states, \"The camera is at a varying Dutch angle.\" This is only true for the **second shot**. The first shot has a perfectly level horizon.\n    *   **Focus:** The caption claims the video \"uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.\" This is only true for the **first shot**. The second shot has a noticeably shallower depth of field, where the background is soft and out of focus.\n    *   **Movement:** It conflates movements from both shots into one description: \"...moves forward, slightly tilting up... with a gentle counter-clockwise roll.\" The forward movement and tilt happen in both shots, but the **roll only occurs in the second shot**.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Missing Transition:** The instruction explicitly asks to \"note the type of transition (e.g., hard cut...).\" The caption completely omits the obvious **hard cut** between the two segments.\n*   **Missing Movement:** The caption fails to mention that in the first shot, the camera is also **trucking (moving) to the right** as it dollies forward.\n*   **Incomplete Framing Description:** It doesn't describe the change in framing, which goes from a medium-long shot to a medium-close-up.\n*   **Incomplete Angle/Height Description:** While it mentions the \"low angle\" in the second shot, it doesn't specify the camera's low height (e.g., hip-level).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Failure to Separate Segments:** The caption directly violates the instruction: \"**When shot transitions occur, describe the camera framing and movement in each segment separately...**\" By merging the two shots into one description, it fails the most critical part of the instruction for this specific video.\n*   **Incomplete Focus Description:** It doesn't follow the instruction to \"state the focus plane at each stage\" when the focus changes. It should have noted the deep focus in the first shot and the shallow depth of field with focus on the midground in the second.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately follows all the instructions:\n\nThe first shot begins at eye-level with a level angle and deep focus. The camera smoothly dollies forward and trucks right while tilting up slightly to keep the subject centered.\n\nAfter a hard cut, the second shot is framed as a medium-close-up from a low angle and hip-level height. The camera has a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the person in the midground. It continues to dolly forward and tilt up toward the person's face, now incorporating a gentle, continuous counter-clockwise roll, which creates a varying Dutch angle.",
