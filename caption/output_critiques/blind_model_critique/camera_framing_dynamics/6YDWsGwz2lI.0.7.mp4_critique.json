    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tail-tracks a person walking forward from behind. It slightly trucks right while panning left to keep the person-centered.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Let's break down the provided caption based on the detailed instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good but contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the focus and depth of field. It excels at describing the camera's position and complex movement with precise terminology but misidentifies a key visual characteristic.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle\" is perfectly accurate. The camera is held at a natural height behind the subject, and the frame is not tilted up, down, or sideways.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** \"smoothly tail-tracks a person walking forward, slightly trucking right while panning left to keep the person centered\" is an exceptionally accurate and sophisticated description of the movement. It correctly identifies the primary tracking motion and the subtle, counteracting secondary movements (trucking and panning) used to maintain framing.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"The movement is smooth with minimal shaking\" is also accurate. The shot is very stable, suggesting the use of a gimbal or excellent in-camera stabilization, with only a slight, natural sway from the operator's walk.\n\n*   **Incorrect:**\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** The description \"**using deep focus with a large depth of field**\" is incorrect. The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**. The subject in the midground is sharp, but the background (the trees and path further away) is noticeably blurred. Deep focus would render both the subject and the distant background in sharp focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Covered Well:** The caption successfully covers camera height, angle, movement type (tracking, trucking, panning), movement purpose (to keep the person centered), and steadiness.\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Focus Plane:** The instructions ask for the focus plane (foreground, midground, background). The caption doesn't specify this. The focus is clearly on the **midground** subject.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** While \"tail-tracks\" implies the focus is following the subject, the instructions mention \"focus tracking.\" Explicitly stating that the focus is **tracking** the subject as they move away would make the description more complete.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary information. It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles because they are not present, just as the instructions advised.\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses precise and advanced terminology (\"tail-tracks,\" \"trucking,\" \"panning\") effectively, demonstrating a strong understanding of camera language.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The primary failure in adherence is the inaccurate application of the term \"deep focus,\" which directly contradicts the visual evidence and the instruction to describe focus correctly.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and adds the missing details, fully adhering to the instructions:\n\n**The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The focus is locked on the person in the midground, blurring the background. The camera smoothly tail-tracks the subject, trucking slightly right while panning left to keep them centered. The movement is steady with minimal natural sway.**",
