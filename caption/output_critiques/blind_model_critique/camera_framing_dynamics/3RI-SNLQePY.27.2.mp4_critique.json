    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great example to work with. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It is accurate in what it describes and follows the instruction for conciseness, but it fails to include all the required elements outlined in the prompt, specifically regarding focus and depth of field.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy:**\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n\n*   **Camera Angle/Height:** \"high-angle, overhead shot\" is a correct description. The camera is positioned directly above the subject, which qualifies as both a high angle and, more specifically, an overhead or bird's-eye view.\n*   **Camera Movement:** \"slowly and smoothly trucks from left to right\" is a perfect technical description. The movement is unhurried, steady, and it is a **trucking** motion (moving parallel to the subject) rather than a pan (rotating from a fixed point).\n*   **Movement Purpose:** \"following the character\" correctly identifies the purpose of the movement, which is to **track** the subject.\n\n#### **Completeness:**\n\nThe caption is **incomplete**. It omits a key piece of information requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Information:** The instructions explicitly ask for a description of **focus and depth of field**. This video has a **deep depth of field (or deep focus)**, where both the character in the midground and the floor tiles in the foreground and background are all in sharp focus. The caption makes no mention of this.\n*   **What it got right:** The caption correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none of these are present, adhering to the instruction to be concise.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption demonstrates partial adherence to the instructions.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is **concise**, as requested.\n    *   It correctly uses technical terms for camera movement (**trucks**) and describes its qualities (**slowly, smoothly**) and purpose (**following the character**).\n    *   It correctly identifies the **camera angle and height**.\n    *   It correctly avoids mentioning attributes that are standard or absent (regular speed, no distortion).\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The primary failure is the omission of the **focus and depth of field**, which was a mandatory component of the description according to the prompt.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that fully adheres to all instructions:\n\n**\"This overhead, bird's-eye view shot uses deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera slowly and smoothly trucks right, tracking a character as they walk through a dark lobby.\"**",
