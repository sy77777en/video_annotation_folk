    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The unsteady camera moves forward to approach the plane, with a slight downward movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** \"This is a level-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire aircraft and its surroundings sharp. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward and slightly downward to approach the plane.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation:**\n\nThe caption is **very good** and accurately describes the most prominent visual characteristics of the video. It is concise, informative, and follows most of the instructions well. However, it could be slightly more complete.\n\n### **Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **\"level-angle shot\"**: **Correct.** The camera is positioned parallel to the ground, not pointing significantly up or down.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire aircraft and its surroundings sharp\"**: **Correct.** Both the foreground (tarmac), midground (plane), and background (sky) are in sharp focus, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady camera\"**: **Correct.** The movement has a natural, handheld quality consistent with someone walking, causing minor wobbles.\n*   **\"moves forward and slightly downward\"**: **Correct.** The camera is clearly dollying forward toward the plane and has a subtle downward drift as it gets closer.\n*   **\"to approach the plane\"**: **Correct.** This accurately states the purpose of the camera movement.\n\n**2. Completeness: Good**\n\nThe caption successfully covers several key aspects required by the instructions:\n*   **Camera Angle:** Yes (\"level-angle\").\n*   **Focus/Depth of Field:** Yes (\"deep focus\").\n*   **Camera Movement (Type, Steadiness, Purpose):** Yes (\"moves forward and slightly downward,\" \"slightly unsteady,\" \"to approach the plane\").\n\nHowever, it is missing one element requested in the instructions:\n*   **Camera Height:** The instructions ask for a description of the camera's height (e.g., eye-level, hip-level, ground-level). The shot appears to be taken from **eye-level** or chest-level, which is not mentioned in the caption.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and effective.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** It correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is regular), **lens distortion** (which is absent), and **Dutch angle** (which is not present), just as the instructions advised.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and easy to understand.\n\n### **Conclusion & Recommendation**\n\nThe caption is excellent and almost perfect. Its only minor flaw is the omission of the camera's height. To make it fully compliant with the instructions, you could add that detail.\n\n**Slightly Improved Version (for 100% compliance):**\n\n\"This is an **eye-level**, level-angle shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire aircraft and its surroundings sharp. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward and slightly downward to approach the plane.\"",
