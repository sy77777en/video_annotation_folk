    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a high angle, looking down. The camera is initially static but becomes very shaky, with noticeable unsteadiness. Midway, it performs a rapid zoom-in to focus on a light source held by a man seated in front of a computer. The camera moves quickly, and the dim lighting and low resolution make it difficult to determine the focus type.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The lighting is dim, and the low resolution makes it difficult to determine the type of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shot is very shaky, initially staying static. Midway, it performs a rapid zoom-in to focus on the light source held by a man seated in front of a computer.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good attempt at a caption, but it can be significantly improved in accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the specific terminology requested in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Good:** The description of the camera being \"very shaky\" and having \"noticeable unsteadiness\" is accurate. The video is clearly handheld and unstable.\n*   **Good:** Identifying the target of the movement as \"a light source held by a man seated in front of a computer\" is correct.\n*   **Good:** The observation that \"dim lighting and low resolution make it difficult to determine the focus type\" is an excellent and accurate assessment.\n*   **Partially Accurate:** \"The video is shot at eye level with a high angle\" is mostly correct. The camera is held at the operator's eye level, but it's angled downwards, creating a high angle on the subject. The phrasing is a little clunky but captures the essence.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The most significant error is describing the movement as only a \"rapid zoom-in.\" The camera is clearly moving forward through space (a **dolly-in**) *at the same time* as it zooms in. This combined movement (often called a \"dolly zoom\" or \"zolly\") creates a much more dramatic and disorienting effect than a simple zoom. The caption completely misses the physical translation of the camera.\n*   **Inaccurate:** Stating the camera is \"initially static\" is incorrect. It is handheld and exhibits minor, unsteady movement from the very beginning before the major forward motion starts.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   **Missing:** The caption fails to describe the primary camera movement correctly. It omits the **dolly-in**, which is a key translational movement required by the instructions.\n*   **Good (by omission):** The caption correctly follows the instruction to not mention video speed or lens distortion, as both are standard/absent.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Failed:** The instruction explicitly asks for descriptions of \"movements (translation, rotation, zooming...)\" and provides specific terms like \"dollying.\" The caption fails to identify and name the dolly movement.\n*   **Could be Improved:** The instruction asks for a \"concise\" description. The caption has some redundancy, such as \"very shaky, with noticeable unsteadiness.\" A more concise phrasing would be \"the camera is very unsteady\" or \"the shot is characterized by severe shakiness.\"\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**Shot from an eye-level height at a high angle, the handheld camera is very unsteady. It begins with slight, shaky movement before performing a rapid and shaky dolly-in and zoom-in simultaneously, moving aggressively toward a man at a desk to focus on a bright light he is holding. Due to the low resolution and dim lighting, the depth of field is unclear.**",
