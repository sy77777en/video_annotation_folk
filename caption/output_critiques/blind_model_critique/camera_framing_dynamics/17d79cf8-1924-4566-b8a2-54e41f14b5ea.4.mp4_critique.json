    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from a bird's-eye view at eye level, focusing on a person handling bricks. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. It follows the person's point of view as they move forward and slightly to the left, with noticeable shaking throughout, indicating unsteady camera movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera follows the person's point of view from a bird's-eye perspective, capturing them moving forward and slightly to the left, with noticeable shaking throughout.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **partially good** but contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the camera's angle and height. While it correctly identifies the movement, focus, and unsteady nature of the shot, the foundational description of the camera's position is flawed.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The phrase **\"shot from a bird's-eye view at eye level\"** is contradictory and incorrect.\n    *   A **bird's-eye view** is a shot taken from directly overhead, looking straight down (90-degree angle).\n    *   **Eye-level** refers to the camera's height from the ground, which is correct in this video (the camera is held by a person at their eye/chest level).\n    *   The correct description is an **eye-level height** with a **high angle**, as the camera is tilted downwards to look at the hands and the ground. It is not a bird's-eye view.\n\n*   **Accurate:** The rest of the caption is accurate.\n    *   **\"focusing on a person handling bricks\"**: Correctly identifies the subject and action.\n    *   **\"maintains deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. The hands in the foreground, the bricks, and the ground in the midground are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"follows the person's point of view\"**: Correctly identifies this as a POV shot.\n    *   **\"move forward and slightly to the left, with noticeable shaking throughout\"**: Accurately describes the camera's translation and unsteady nature.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Good:** The caption is concise and covers the most important aspects of the shot as requested. It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., altered video speed, lens distortion, Dutch angle), which adheres to the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Could be Improved:**\n    *   While \"follows the person's point of view\" is good, using the standard term **\"first-person point-of-view (POV)\"** would be more technically precise.\n    *   The description of movement is functional but could use more technical terms like **\"dolly forward\"** or simply state it's a **\"handheld shot,\"** which explains the source of the shaking.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Good Adherence:**\n    *   It attempts to cover **camera angle** and **camera height**.\n    *   It successfully describes **focus (depth)**.\n    *   It details **movements (translation, steadiness, and purpose)**.\n    *   It remains **concise** as requested.\n\n*   **Poor Adherence:**\n    *   The primary failure is providing an inaccurate and confusing description of the **camera's configuration (angle and height)**. The instruction asks for an \"informative description,\" and the one provided is misleading.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and better adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"This first-person point-of-view (POV) shot is filmed from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down at the subject's hands and the path ahead. The handheld camera moves forward and slightly to the left, exhibiting a natural, unsteady shake consistent with walking. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the foreground (hands and bricks) and midground (the ground) sharp throughout.\"**",
