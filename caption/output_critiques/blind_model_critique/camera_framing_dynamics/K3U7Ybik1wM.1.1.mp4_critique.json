    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core elements of a Dutch angle and shallow depth of field, it oversimplifies the visual information and contains a minor contradiction. The phrase \"level but fixed Dutch angle\" is confusing, as a Dutch angle is inherently not level; it would be more accurate to specify the camera's height and angle separately, for example, \"The camera is positioned at a low angle, approximately hip-level, and is tilted 20 degrees clockwise.\" The description of the camera as \"static\" might miss subtle but important movements; for instance, the video could feature a very slow, almost imperceptible dolly-in toward the armchair, creating a sense of unease or drawing the viewer into the scene. The description of the focus could also be more nuanced. Instead of just being on the \"midground,\" an ultra-shallow depth of field might render only the front armrest of the chair in sharp focus, while the back of the chair and the immediate foreground (e.g., the corner of a rug) are softly blurred. The caption also fails to note if there are any focus changes, such as a slow rack focus from the armchair to a photograph on the wall behind it, which would be a significant narrative action. Finally, mentioning the absence of lens distortion could be useful if the room's straight lines (e.g., door frames, windows) appear perfectly linear, suggesting a prime lens was used to create a clean, deliberate composition.",
