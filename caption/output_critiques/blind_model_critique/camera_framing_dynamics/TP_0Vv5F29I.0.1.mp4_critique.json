    "pre_caption": "This is a smooth, overhead-level tracking shot that moves forward and to the right, following a train customized with skate ramps from its rear side. The video employs a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the train in the midground to the landscape in the background, sharp and clear.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and moving right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the rear-side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of a \"smooth, overhead-level tracking shot that moves forward and to the right\" is precise. The camera (likely a drone) maintains a smooth trajectory, follows the train (tracking), moves along with it (forward), and simultaneously shifts its position from behind to the side (to the right).\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the \"speed ramp effect,\" accurately noting the shifts between fast and slow motion, which is the most prominent visual effect in the video.\n*   **Focus:** The term \"deep focus\" is used correctly. The entire scene, from the train in the midground to the distant landscape in the background, remains sharp and in focus throughout the shot.\n*   **Camera Height/Angle:** \"Overhead-level\" is a fitting description for a shot that is high above the subject but not a direct 90-degree bird's-eye view.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary information. As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of lens distortion or Dutch angles, as none are present.\n*   **Required Elements:** It successfully covers all the key aspects requested in the instructions that are relevant to this specific video:\n    *   **Video Speed:** Clearly stated as \"speed ramp.\"\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** Combined effectively as \"overhead-level.\"\n    *   **Movements:** The type (tracking), steadiness (smooth), and direction (forward and to the right) are all included.\n    *   **Focus:** The depth (deep focus) and focus plane (midground to background) are perfectly described.\n*   **Terminology:** The caption uses the precise terminology outlined in the instructions (e.g., \"tracking shot,\" \"speed ramp,\" \"deep focus\"), demonstrating a clear understanding of the concepts.\n*   **Structure:** The description is well-organized, starting with the camera's movement and position, then addressing the video effects, and concluding with the focus. This logical flow makes it easy to understand.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the detailed instructions. It is factually correct, includes all the necessary information without being verbose, and uses the specified technical language appropriately.",
