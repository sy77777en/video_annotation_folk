    "pre_caption": "This time-lapse video is captured from a low, eye-level perspective with a fixed Dutch angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp, while slowly and smoothly zooming in.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video showing time passing rapidly over a long period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is mostly accurate and concise but contains one significant error regarding the camera's height and angle. It successfully identifies several key technical aspects of the shot but misinterprets a crucial one, leading to a contradictory description.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a **time-lapse**, which is evident from the rapid movement of the clouds and the setting sun.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** It accurately notes the presence of a **fixed Dutch angle**, as the horizon is clearly tilted throughout the shot and does not change.\n    *   **Focus:** The description of **deep focus** is correct. The bridge in the midground and the buildings and clouds in the background are all sharp and in focus.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The caption correctly identifies that the camera **slowly and smoothly zooms in**.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The phrase **\"low, eye-level perspective\"** is contradictory and inaccurate.\n        *   The shot is taken from a **low angle**, meaning the camera is positioned low and pointed upward.\n        *   It is **not eye-level**. An eye-level shot would be positioned at the height of a person's eyes, looking straight ahead. This camera is clearly much closer to the ground. The correct terms would be **\"low height\"** and **\"low angle.\"**\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is quite complete and follows the instruction to be concise by omitting unnecessary information.\n*   It correctly leaves out any mention of **lens distortion** or **focus changes**, as there are none.\n*   It covers the most important aspects: video speed, camera angle (partially), movement, and focus.\n*   However, by using the inaccurate term \"eye-level perspective,\" it fails to completely and correctly describe the camera's position. A more complete description would have simply used \"low angle.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption adheres well to the instruction to be concise. It packs a good amount of information into a single sentence.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct terminology for \"time-lapse,\" \"Dutch angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"zooming in.\" The only failure in terminology is the misuse of \"eye-level.\"\n*   **Clarity:** The primary failure is in clarity. The contradiction between \"low\" and \"eye-level\" makes the description confusing and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the camera's position. The instructions call for an \"informative description,\" and this part is misinformative.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the errors and better adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"This time-lapse video is captured from a low angle with a fixed Dutch angle. The camera slowly and smoothly zooms in while maintaining a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this is better:**\n*   **Accurate Position:** It replaces the contradictory \"low, eye-level perspective\" with the precise and correct term **\"low angle.\"**\n*   **Clear and Unambiguous:** The description of the camera's position is now perfectly clear.\n*   **Fully Adherent:** This version is concise, informative, and uses all the correct terminology as required by the instructions.",
