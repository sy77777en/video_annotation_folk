    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** and provides an accurate, concise summary of the video's key visual elements. It successfully identifies the most prominent camera attributes. However, it misses one key technical detail regarding focus, which prevents it from being a complete description according to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in the information it presents:\n*   **\"eye-level, level-angle shot\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level and is not angled up or down.\n*   **\"slowly and smoothly pushes in\"**: This perfectly describes the camera's movement. It's a slow, steady forward dolly (or \"push in\").\n*   **\"on a woman reading a tablet in bed\"**: This accurately describes the subject and action.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: This is correct. The background (headboard, wall) is clearly out of focus, isolating the subject.\n*   **\"keeping the woman in the midground in focus\"**: This is also correct. The woman is the plane of focus, and she occupies the midground of the frame.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThis is the main area for improvement. While the caption is concise, it omits a key detail required by the instructions.\n\n*   **What's Missing:** The instructions state, \"If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus*... or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement).\"\n    *   In this video, as the camera dollies forward, the distance between the lens and the subject decreases. To keep the woman perfectly in focus, the camera operator must continuously adjust the focus (a technique called a \"focus pull\" or \"focus tracking\"). The caption correctly notes that she *stays* in focus but fails to mention that this is an *active* process of focus tracking, which is a crucial part of the shot's technical execution.\n\n*   **What's Handled Well:** The caption correctly omits details that are not present, as per the instructions:\n    *   No mention of **video speed**, as it is regular.\n    *   No mention of **lens distortion**, as there is none.\n    *   No mention of a **Dutch angle**, as the horizon is level.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to most of the stylistic and formatting rules.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise and effective, avoiding unnecessary words.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct and specified terminology (e.g., \"eye-level,\" \"level-angle,\" \"pushes in,\" \"shallow depth of field\").\n*   **Structure:** It logically describes the camera's position and angle first, then its movement, and finally the focus characteristics.\n\n### Conclusion and Improved Caption\n\nThe caption is a strong, accurate summary. Its only weakness is the omission of the dynamic focus tracking, which is a specific requirement of the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is an improved version that incorporates the missing detail for full completeness:\n\n**Improved Caption:**\nThis eye-level, level-angle shot slowly and smoothly pushes in on a woman reading a tablet in bed. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, and the focus actively tracks the woman in the midground to keep her sharp throughout the movement.",
