    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great example to analyze. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption.\n\nOverall, the caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot but contains one significant inaccuracy and could be more precise in its terminology according to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the camera height, the direction of movement, the purpose of the movement, and the use of deep focus.\n    *   **\"eye-level perspective\"**: This is accurate in relation to the audience. The camera is positioned at the head height of a seated or standing person in the crowd.\n    *   **\"moves smoothly to the right, revealing a man on a stage\"**: This is a correct description of the movement's direction, quality, and narrative purpose.\n    *   **\"deep focus, keeping both the audience in the foreground and the man on stage sharp and clear\"**: This is an excellent and accurate description. Both the foreground (audience) and midground (man on stage) are in sharp focus, which is the definition of deep focus.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"level... perspective\"**: This is incorrect. While the camera's roll axis is level (no Dutch angle), the camera is tilted **upwards** to frame the man on the elevated stage. This makes it a **low angle** shot, not a level angle shot. A level angle would mean the camera is pointing straight ahead, parallel to the ground, which would cut off the subject's head.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Included (Good):** The caption successfully covers camera height, a general description of movement, the purpose of the movement, and the depth of field. It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard.\n\n*   **What's Missing (Minor Omission):**\n    *   **Specific Movement Type:** The instructions list specific terms like *trucking* (moving left/right). The caption uses the more generic \"moves... to the right.\" While not wrong, it's less precise. Since the camera is physically moving sideways (indicated by the changing perspective between the foreground heads and the background), the correct term is **trucking**.\n    *   **Angle:** The angle is mentioned, but inaccurately. A complete description would correctly identify it as a low angle.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise and well-written, avoiding unnecessary words. This is a strong point.\n*   **Informativeness:** It provides key information about the shot's composition and intent.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** The caption successfully uses \"deep focus\" and \"eye-level.\" However, it fails to use the more precise terms **\"low angle\"** and **\"trucking,\"** which are explicitly encouraged by the detailed instructions. This is the main area where it falls short of fully adhering to the prompt.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a good, easily understandable description for a general audience. However, when judged strictly against the detailed technical instructions provided, it has a clear inaccuracy (level vs. low angle) and misses an opportunity for greater precision (moves vs. trucking).\n\n### Revised Caption (incorporating feedback)\n\nHere is a revised version that is more accurate and complete according to the instructions:\n\n**\"From an eye-level height and a low angle, the camera trucks smoothly to the right to reveal a man on stage. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the audience in the foreground and the man in the midground sharp and clear.\"**",
