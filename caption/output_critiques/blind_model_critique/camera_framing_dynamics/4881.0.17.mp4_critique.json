    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward to focus on the girl initially, then subtly arcs clockwise around her.\n\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good overall, providing a concise and mostly accurate description of the shot. However, it contains one key inaccuracy regarding the camera angle.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate.**\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"Positioned at hip level\" is an accurate description of the camera's low height relative to the subject.\n    *   **Focus:** \"uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the girl in the midground\" is perfectly accurate. The background is clearly blurred, and the girl is the sharp focal point in the middle of the frame's depth.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is excellent. \"smoothly moves forward toward her, then begins to arc subtly clockwise around her\" correctly identifies the two distinct, sequential motions (a dolly-in followed by an arc) and their qualities (smooth, subtle, clockwise).\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption states the camera \"maintains a level angle,\" which is inaccurate. The camera is positioned low and tilted **upward** to frame the girl. This is a **low angle**, not a level one. A level angle would be parallel to the ground.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   **Excellent.**\n*   The caption successfully includes all the necessary, non-default information required by the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Height:** Included.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Included (though inaccurately).\n    *   **Focus/Depth of Field:** Included.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** Described in detail, including type, direction, and steadiness (\"smoothly\").\n*   It correctly omits information about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none of these are present or altered from the default. This makes the caption concise as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Excellent.**\n*   The caption follows the instructions very well by being \"concise yet informative.\"\n*   It correctly describes the camera's configuration and movement in a clear, temporal order.\n*   It avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"moves forward\" instead of \"dollies in\"), making it accessible while still being descriptive.\n*   It correctly omits details about standard playback speed and the absence of distortion, as per the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is strong and adheres well to the detailed instructions. Its only flaw is the misidentification of the camera angle.\n\n**Corrected Caption:**\n\nTo be perfectly accurate, the caption should be:\n\n\"Positioned at **hip level**, the camera uses a **low angle** and a shallow depth of field to focus on the girl in the midground. The camera smoothly moves forward toward her, then begins to arc subtly clockwise around her.\"",
