    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, using deep focus for a large depth of field. The camera smoothly pans right to follow a white car as it drives away, causing the car to become smaller in the frame during the tracking shot. The camera movement is steady and fluid throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning rightward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions. Here is a thorough breakdown of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good and largely accurate. It correctly identifies most of the key camera and video attributes. However, it could be improved by being more concise and removing redundant information, as per the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle...\"**: This is accurate. The camera is not high, low, or tilted. It's positioned as if held by a standing person.\n*   **\"...using deep focus for a large depth of field.\"**: This is correct. The foreground, midground (the car), and background (buildings, trees) are all in sharp focus.\n*   **\"The camera smoothly pans right...\"**: This is the correct technical term for the camera's movement (rotating horizontally). The movement is indeed smooth.\n*   **\"...to follow a white car as it drives away...\"**: This accurately describes the purpose of the pan and the action of the subject.\n*   **\"...during the tracking shot.\"**: This is also correct. A shot that follows a moving subject is a tracking shot. In this case, the tracking is achieved via a pan.\n\n#### **Completeness: Very Good**\n\nThe caption successfully covers the required elements that are present in the video:\n*   **Camera Height:** `eye level`\n*   **Camera Angle:** `level angle`\n*   **Focus:** `deep focus`\n*   **Movements:** `pans right`, `tracking`\n*   **Steadiness:** `smoothly`\n\nIt also correctly adheres to the instruction to omit details that are not present (e.g., it doesn't mention video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, because they are all standard/absent).\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions (Conciseness): Good, but could be improved**\n\nThe main area for improvement is conciseness. The instructions state, \"Try to make the description as concise as possible.\" The caption contains some redundancy.\n\n1.  **Redundancy in Movement Description:**\n    *   The caption says, **\"The camera smoothly pans right...\"** and later adds, **\"The camera movement is steady and fluid throughout.\"**\n    *   The word \"smoothly\" already conveys that the movement is \"steady and fluid.\" The second sentence is entirely redundant and can be removed to make the caption more concise.\n\n2.  **Redundancy in Subject Description:**\n    *   The caption states the camera follows the car **\"as it drives away, causing the car to become smaller in the frame...\"**\n    *   The fact that the car is \"driving away\" inherently means it will become smaller in the frame (unless the camera is dollying forward to compensate, which it is not). Stating this effect is unnecessary and adds length. It describes a result of the subject's movement rather than a camera action.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is factually correct and covers the necessary points. However, it violates the instruction for conciseness by including redundant phrases.\n\n### **Improved Caption**\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more concise while retaining all the essential, accurate information:\n\n**\"Positioned at eye level with a level angle and deep focus, the camera smoothly pans right to track a white car as it drives away.\"**\n\n**Why this is better:**\n*   **Concise:** It's a single, efficient sentence.\n*   **Comprehensive:** It still includes height, angle, focus, movement type, steadiness, and purpose.\n*   **Eliminates Redundancy:** It removes the repetitive description of the movement's steadiness and the unnecessary observation about the car's apparent size.",
