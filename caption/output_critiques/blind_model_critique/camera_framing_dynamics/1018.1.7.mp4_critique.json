    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an hip level (at the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is very good, but it can be improved by incorporating more of the specific terminology requested in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** The video features a camera at hip level with a low angle, looking up. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly backward, leading the man in the foreground who is holding a wrapped object.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"Hip level with a low angle, looking up\" is a perfect description. The camera is clearly positioned low to the ground and angled upward at the subject and the environment.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"Deep focus with a large depth of field\" is accurate. The man in the foreground, the street, and the buildings in the background are all in sharp focus.\n*   **Camera Movement:** \"Moves smoothly backward, leading the man\" is entirely correct. The movement is fluid, its direction is backward, and its purpose is to keep the forward-walking man in the frame.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Good\n\nThe caption successfully covers the most prominent features of the shot. It correctly omits details that are not present, such as video speed alterations, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, as per the instructions.\n\nHowever, it could be more complete by using the specific technical terms for the movements described in the instructions.\n\n*   **Included:** Camera height, angle, focus/depth, movement direction, steadiness, and purpose.\n*   **Minor Omission:** While \"moves backward\" is correct, the instructions provide the more technical term **dollying** (or \"dolly out\" / \"dolly backward\"). Similarly, \"leading the man\" is a functional description of a **tracking shot**. Combining these terms would make the description more technically complete.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Good\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and effective.\n*   **Informative Description:** It provides a clear picture of the shot's configuration.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** This is the main area for improvement. The caption uses descriptive, everyday language (\"moves backward\") instead of the specific cinematic terms (*dollying*, *tracking*) that the instructions encourage.\n*   **Redundancy:** There is minor redundancy. \"Low angle\" inherently means \"looking up,\" and \"deep focus\" is synonymous with \"large depth of field.\" While not a major issue, combining these could make the caption even more concise.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is **good** and highly accurate. It successfully communicates the essential visual information. Its primary weakness is not fully leveraging the specific technical vocabulary outlined in the instructions, which would elevate it from a good description to an expert one.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more concise and adheres more closely to the technical terminology requested:\n\n**\"A low-angle, hip-level tracking shot smoothly dollies backward, leading a man in the foreground. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the subject and the background environment sharp.\"**\n\nThis revised version:\n1.  Uses the technical terms **\"tracking shot\"** and **\"dollies backward.\"**\n2.  Removes the minor redundancies (\"looking up,\" \"large depth of field\").\n3.  Remains concise while being more technically precise.",
