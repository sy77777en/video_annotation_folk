    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is arcing clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the caption against the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **good but contains one significant inaccuracy** that creates a contradiction. It is otherwise concise, informative, and adheres well to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Movement:** The description \"slowly and smoothly arcs clockwise\" is perfectly accurate. The camera performs a slow, steady, circular movement from left to right around the subject.\n    *   **Focus:** The description \"maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire picnic arrangement sharp\" is also correct. Both the foreground (blanket) and background (basket) are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n    *   **Subject:** The description of the scene as a \"picnic set laid out on a wooden deck\" is accurate context.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Angle and Height:** The phrase **\"From a high, hip-level angle\"** is contradictory and inaccurate.\n        *   A **high angle** means the camera is positioned *above* the subject, looking down. This is correct for the video.\n        *   A **hip-level** height describes the camera being held at the operator's hip. For a subject on the ground like this, a hip-level shot would result in a **level or slightly low angle**, not a high angle.\n        *   The camera in the video is clearly at a **high angle**, likely held at chest or shoulder height by a standing person looking down.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most important and non-standard elements required by the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** It attempts to cover both, although inaccurately.\n    *   **Movements:** It fully describes the type (arcing), speed (slowly), steadiness (smoothly), and direction (clockwise).\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly identifies the deep focus.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, as per the instructions:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\nThe caption is very complete in its adherence to the \"only mention what's relevant\" rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and gets straight to the point.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms like \"arcs clockwise\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the camera's static properties (angle/height) before describing its movement and focus, which is a clear and effective structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written and follows the instructions closely, but the single error in describing the camera's position is a notable flaw. The combination of \"high\" and \"hip-level\" is confusing and factually incorrect for this specific shot.\n\n### Revised and Improved Captions\n\nHere are two alternative captions that correct the error while maintaining the quality of the original.\n\n**Option 1 (Concise and Correct):**\n> From a high angle, the camera slowly and smoothly arcs clockwise around a picnic set on a wooden deck. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire arrangement sharp.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Detailed and Precise):**\n> Shot from a high angle at approximately shoulder-level, the camera performs a slow, smooth clockwise arc around a picnic set. The focus is deep, ensuring the entire arrangement and its immediate surroundings on the wooden deck remain in sharp focus throughout the movement.",
