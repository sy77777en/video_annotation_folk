    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts with a slight pan to the left, then smoothly moves backward throughout the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is good, but it can be improved for greater accuracy and more complete adherence to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus for a large depth of field. It begins with a slight pan to the left, focusing on a man in a lab coat working at a counter. The camera then smoothly moves backward, maintaining steadiness throughout.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: **Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"Eye level\" and \"level angle\" are accurate descriptions.\n    *   **Focus:** \"Deep focus for a large depth of field\" is perfectly accurate. All planes of the image (foreground, midground, background) are sharp.\n    *   **Initial Movement:** \"Begins with a slight pan to the left\" is a great observation of the subtle initial movement.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"Maintaining steadiness throughout\" is correct; the movement is very smooth, suggesting a dolly or slider.\n\n*   **What Could Be More Accurate:**\n    *   The description of the main movement is slightly simplified. While the camera does \"move backward,\" it also simultaneously **pans left** to keep the subject relatively centered as the frame widens. The caption presents the pan and the backward movement as two separate, sequential actions, when the pan actually continues during the backward move.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: **Good but Incomplete**\n\n*   **What's Included:** The caption successfully covers height, angle, focus, and the general direction and steadiness of the movement. It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as per the instructions, because they are standard.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Specific Movement Terminology:** The instructions ask for specific terms like \"dollying,\" \"trucking,\" \"panning,\" etc. The caption uses the generic phrase \"moves backward\" instead of the more precise technical term **\"dolly out\"** or **\"dolly backward.\"**\n    *   **Complexity of Movement:** It fails to mention that two movements (dollying and panning) are happening concurrently during the main camera move.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: **Good but Not Perfect**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is commendably concise.\n*   **Informative Description:** It is informative but misses the opportunity to be more precise by using the specific terminology requested in the instructions (e.g., \"dollying\").\n*   **Describing Multiple Movements:** The instructions state, \"If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order.\" The caption does this but misses the nuance that the movements become simultaneous.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a solid B+. It correctly identifies the most important visual characteristics of the shot. However, it falls short of being an A+ by using generic language for the camera movement (\"moves backward\") instead of the specific technical term (\"dolly out\") and by not describing the complexity of the simultaneous pan and dolly.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely follows the instructions by incorporating the missing details and technical terms:\n\n**\"The shot is captured from a steady, eye-level camera with a level angle and deep focus. It begins with a slight pan to the left, then smoothly dollies backward while simultaneously panning left to keep the man at the counter centered in the widening frame.\"**",
