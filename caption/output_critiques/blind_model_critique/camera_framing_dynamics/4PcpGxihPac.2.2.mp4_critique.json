    "pre_caption": "This is a low-angle, eye-level shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the man in the foreground. The camera is static but has a slight unsteadiness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but contains a significant inaccuracy that makes it contradictory. It successfully identifies several key aspects of the shot but fails in its description of the camera's angle and height.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the **shallow depth of field**, the **focus on the man in the foreground**, the **static camera**, and the **slight unsteadiness**.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the shot as both **\"low-angle\"** and **\"eye-level\"** is contradictory.\n    *   An **eye-level** (or level-angle) shot looks straight at a subject on a horizontal plane.\n    *   A **low-angle** shot looks up at a subject from a lower position.\n    *   This video is clearly filmed from a **low angle**, as the camera is positioned below the man's eye line and is tilted upward to frame him. The term \"eye-level\" is incorrect and should be removed.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   **Good:** The caption effectively covers the most important aspects required by the instructions: angle, focus/depth, and movement/steadiness.\n*   **Adheres to Conciseness:** It correctly omits details about video speed (which is normal) and lens distortion (which is absent), as per the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption follows the instruction to be concise while attempting to be informative.\n*   It correctly uses terminology like \"shallow depth of field\" and \"static.\"\n*   The primary failure is the inaccurate combination of technical terms for camera angle and height.\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that is more accurate and adheres strictly to the definitions in your instructions:\n\n**\"This is a static, low-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the man in the foreground. The camera has a slight, natural unsteadiness.\"**",
