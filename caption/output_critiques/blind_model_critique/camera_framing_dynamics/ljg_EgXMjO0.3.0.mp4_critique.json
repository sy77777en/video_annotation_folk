    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video where objects are moved frame by frame to create motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **partially effective but incomplete**. While it accurately describes the general action and feel of the video, it fails to incorporate the specific technical terminology and detailed observations required by the instructions. It provides a good, simple description for a general audience but does not meet the standards of a technical breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe information present in the caption is accurate.\n*   **\"The stop-motion video...\"**: Correct. The video is clearly a stop-motion animation.\n*   **\"...smooth rightward camera movement...\"**: Correct. The camera moves smoothly from left to right.\n*   **\"...tracking a playful scene with animated characters.\"**: Correct. The camera's movement follows the characters, which is the definition of a tracking shot.\n*   **\"...maintaining steadiness throughout.\"**: Correct. The movement is perfectly steady with no shaking or wobbling.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (Major Area for Improvement)\n\nThe caption is missing several key descriptive elements required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** The caption uses the general term \"rightward camera movement\" but omits the specific technical term **trucking right**. The instructions explicitly ask for terms like *trucking*, *dollying*, *panning*, etc.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption states the camera follows \"from the side,\" which is a vague description. It completely omits the required terminology for **camera angle (level angle)** and **camera height (character eye-level)**.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**, where the characters in the **midground** are in sharp focus, and the background elements (the blue and yellow blocks) are softly blurred. The caption makes no mention of focus, depth, or the focus plane.\n*   **Lens Distortion & Video Speed:** The caption correctly omits any mention of lens distortion or altered video speed (other than identifying it as stop-motion), which aligns with the instruction to be concise when these features are absent or normal.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption does not fully adhere to the detailed instructions provided.\n\n*   It fails to use the specific vocabulary requested for camera movement, angle, height, and focus.\n*   The instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**,\" but the caption only provides a high-level summary of the movement's purpose and direction. It misses the core technical configuration details.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"This stop-motion video is captured from a character eye-level and a level angle. The camera performs a smooth and steady truck to the right, tracking the characters' action. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus fixed on the midground, leaving the background softly blurred.\"**\n\n### Why the Revised Caption is Better\n\n*   **Specific Terminology:** Uses the correct terms **\"truck to the right,\" \"level angle,\" \"character eye-level,\" \"shallow depth of field,\"** and **\"midground.\"**\n*   **Comprehensive:** It covers all the observable and relevant technical aspects requested in the instructions (movement, angle, height, focus).\n*   **Concise:** It remains brief and to the point, communicating all the necessary information efficiently without unnecessary words.\n*   **Informative:** It gives a complete picture of how the shot was technically constructed, fulfilling the core requirement of the prompt.",
