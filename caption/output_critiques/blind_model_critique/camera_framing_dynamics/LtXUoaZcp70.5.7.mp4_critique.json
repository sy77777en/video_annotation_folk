    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera performs a sequence of complex motions, tilting and rolling to examine a room filled with multiple human subjects.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, concise, and adheres exceptionally well to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical and stylistic elements:\n\n*   **\"From a high, overhead angle...\"**: This is perfectly correct. The camera is positioned high above the scene, looking almost straight down, which qualifies as both a **high angle** and an **overhead** position.\n*   **\"...the camera performs a smooth, complex movement...\"**: The movement is flawlessly smooth, with no shaking or jitter. It is also complex, as it involves multiple simultaneous actions (rotation and translation).\n*   **\"...tilting and rolling...\"**: This is a crucial and accurate observation. The camera not only moves around the room but also **rolls** on its axis (creating a changing Dutch angle) and appears to **tilt** slightly to keep the center of the room in frame.\n*   **\"...as it examines a room filled with stylized human figures.\"**: This accurately describes the content of the scene and the purpose of the camera movement—to survey the environment.\n*   **\"The shot maintains a deep focus...\"**: This is correct. Every element in the frame, from the figures closest to the camera to the walls in the background, is perfectly sharp. There is no shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"...keeping all the figures and the environment sharp.\"**: This phrase correctly clarifies what \"deep focus\" means in this context, making the description more accessible.\n\n### 2. Completeness (Adherence to Instructions)\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information as required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not needed.\n\n*   **Included (as per instructions):**\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** \"high, overhead angle\" is explicitly stated.\n    *   **Movements:** Described as \"smooth, complex movement, tilting and rolling.\" This covers the type, steadiness, and complexity. The caption could have been even more specific by mentioning the **arcing/orbiting** motion, but \"complex movement\" is an effective and concise summary.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus\" is correctly identified.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The mention of \"rolling\" correctly implies the presence of a varying Dutch angle, fulfilling that part of the instruction.\n\n*   **Omitted (as per instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so the caption correctly omits any mention of it.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so it is correctly left out.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Conciseness and Clarity\n\nThe caption excels at being both concise and informative. It avoids jargon where possible (e.g., explaining \"deep focus\") and combines multiple observations into smooth, flowing sentences. It distills a complex set of camera actions into a description that is easy to understand without being overly simplistic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It accurately identifies the most significant and non-standard features of the shot (the complex rolling movement and the deep focus) while concisely summarizing the overall configuration. It is an excellent and effective description.",
