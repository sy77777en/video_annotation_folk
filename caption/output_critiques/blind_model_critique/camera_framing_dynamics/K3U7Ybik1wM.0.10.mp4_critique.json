    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good but contains one significant inaccuracy and a minor omission. It successfully follows most of the instructions regarding conciseness and content.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Perspective & Content:** \"From a first-person... perspective, the camera looks down at a pair of bare feet walking on a carpet\" is a perfect description of the shot's point of view and subject matter.\n    *   **Movement & Steadiness:** \"The slightly unsteady camera moves forward, simulating the person's gait\" correctly identifies the camera's forward motion, its slight shakiness (typical of a POV shot), and its narrative purpose.\n    *   **Focus:** \"A deep focus keeps both the feet and the floor in sharp detail\" is an excellent and precise description of the depth of field.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The term **\"bird's-eye perspective\" is incorrect.** A bird's-eye view is a shot taken from directly overhead, looking straight down (like a map view). A person looking down at their own feet creates a **high-angle shot**, not a bird's-eye view. This is the most significant error in the caption.\n\n**2. Completeness: Good**\n\n*   **What's Included (Good):** The caption effectively covers the most important aspects: perspective, angle (though inaccurately named), movement, steadiness, purpose, and focus.\n*   **What's Missing (Minor Omission):**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The instruction asks to specify camera height (e.g., *eye-level*, *hip-level*). While \"first-person\" implies a standing height, explicitly stating that the camera is at **eye-level** (looking down) would make the description more complete and precise.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction: Very Good**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary words, as instructed.\n*   **Omitting Defaults:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, assuming they are all standard/absent. This shows a good understanding of the negative constraints in the instructions.\n*   **Descriptive Detail:** It provides informative details about the *type* of movement (\"forward\"), its *steadiness* (\"slightly unsteady\"), its *purpose* (\"simulating the person's gait\"), and the *depth of field* (\"deep focus\").\n\n### Conclusion and Corrected Caption\n\nThe caption is well-written and follows the instructions closely, but the misuse of \"bird's-eye perspective\" is a notable error.\n\n**A more accurate and complete caption would be:**\n\n\"From a first-person, **high-angle** perspective at **eye-level**, the camera looks down at a pair of bare feet walking on a carpet. The slightly unsteady camera moves forward, simulating the person's gait. A deep focus keeps both the feet and the floor in sharp detail.\"",
