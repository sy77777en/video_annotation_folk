    "pre_caption": "This video, featuring a speed ramp effect, is captured from a smooth, overhead drone shot at a high angle. The camera flies low over a desert, moving forward until a racing car appears. To follow the car, the camera rolls slightly clockwise and pans right, creating a varying Dutch angle. As the car kicks up a large cloud of sand that momentarily obscures the lens, the motion transitions into slow motion. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the vast desert landscape sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone camera flies low over a desert, moving forward. A racing car comes into view, and the camera slightly rolls clockwise and pans right to follow the car as it kicks up a cloud of sand, momentarily obscuring the lens. It then continues to follow the car, with the motion gradually transitioning into slow motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies key elements like the speed ramp and the Dutch angle, it could be more precise and evocative. The term \"eye-level drone shot\" is slightly contradictory; a \"low-angle\" or \"ground-skimming aerial shot\" would more accurately describe a drone flying just a few feet above the desert floor. The movement, described as moving forward and then panning, could be more dynamically framed as a single, fluid action: \"The camera tracks the car from behind, rapidly closing the distance before arcing counter-clockwise to its side.\" This also clarifies that the pan and roll are part of a larger tracking and arcing maneuver. Furthermore, the claim of \"deep focus\" throughout the entire scene might be an oversimplification. While the wide desert landscape is sharp initially, I imagine that as the sand cloud erupts in slow motion, the focus would naturally rack to the sand particles in the immediate foreground, creating a shallower depth of field that blurs the car and the distant mountains for dramatic effect. Finally, a shot like this, likely filmed on a wide-angle action camera, would almost certainly exhibit some mild barrel distortion, causing the horizon to curve slightly at the edges of the frame—a detail worth noting for technical accuracy.",
