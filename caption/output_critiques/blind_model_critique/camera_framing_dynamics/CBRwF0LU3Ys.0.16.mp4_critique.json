    "pre_caption": "This video, featuring a speed ramp effect, is captured from a smooth, overhead drone shot at a high angle. The camera flies low over a desert, moving forward until a racing car appears. To follow the car, the camera rolls slightly clockwise and pans right, creating a varying Dutch angle. As the car kicks up a large cloud of sand that momentarily obscures the lens, the motion transitions into slow motion. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping the vast desert landscape sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone camera flies low over a desert, moving forward. A racing car comes into view, and the camera slightly rolls clockwise and pans right to follow the car as it kicks up a cloud of sand, momentarily obscuring the lens. It then continues to follow the car, with the motion gradually transitioning into slow motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres well to the specified format.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's events and technical execution.\n\n*   **Speed Ramp:** Correctly identifies the \"speed ramp effect\" and accurately pinpoints the transition to slow motion as the car kicks up sand.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** The description of a \"smooth, overhead drone shot at a high angle\" that \"flies low\" is precise.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The analysis of the movement is excellent. It correctly identifies the initial forward motion and, most impressively, the combination of a \"roll\" and a \"pan\" to follow the car, which creates the \"varying Dutch angle.\" This is a sophisticated and accurate observation.\n*   **Focus:** The identification of \"deep focus\" is correct, as both the car in the midground and the distant landscape remain sharp.\n*   **Minor Point:** The phrase \"until a racing car appears\" is slightly inaccurate, as the car is visible from the beginning of the shot. A more precise phrasing would be \"as it closes in on a racing car.\" However, this is a very minor narrative choice and doesn't detract significantly from the overall accuracy.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is very thorough and covers nearly all the required elements from the instructions.\n\n*   **Covered:** Video speed, camera angle, camera height, movements (steadiness, direction, type, purpose, complexity), and focus are all described.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of lens distortion or shot transitions, as none are present.\n*   **Potential Addition:** The instruction mentions describing movement types like *tracking*. While the caption implies this by saying \"To follow the car,\" it could be made more explicit by stating that the camera is **tracking** the car. For example: \"...the camera begins **tracking** the car, rolling slightly clockwise and panning right...\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a large amount of technical detail into a single, readable paragraph without being overly verbose.\n*   **Technical Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms like `speed ramp`, `high angle`, `rolls`, `pans`, `Dutch angle`, and `deep focus`.\n*   **Structure:** It logically describes the camera's setup first, then the sequence of movements, and concludes with the focus, creating a clear and easy-to-follow narrative of the shot.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** It successfully explains the *purpose* of the camera movement (\"To follow the car...\"), as requested.\n\n### Final Verdict:\n\n**The caption is excellent.**\n\nIt is a model example of how to apply the detailed instructions to a complex, dynamic shot. It is technically precise, well-structured, and concise. The minor point about the car's appearance is negligible, and the caption would only be marginally improved by explicitly using the term \"tracking.\" Overall, it successfully fulfills all the requirements of the prompt.",
