    "pre_caption": "The video is a stop-motion animation with the camera positioned at eye level, using a bird's-eye view angle to look directly down at the scene. It employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the hands holding a framed photo in the foreground, then shifting focus to the midground items in the drawer. The camera remains static throughout, with no movement or shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video where objects are moved frame by frame to create motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the foreground, and later becomes focused on the midground. The camera uses focus tracking to keep the subject in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the caption against the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good and captures most of the key technical aspects of the video accurately and concisely. However, it contains one significant error in its description of the camera height, which creates a logical contradiction.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** Correctly identifies the video as a **\"stop-motion animation.\"** This is perfectly accurate.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Correctly identifies the angle as a **\"bird's-eye view.\"** The camera is positioned directly above the subject, looking straight down.\n    *   **Focus:** The description of the focus is excellent. It correctly identifies the **\"shallow depth of field,\"** the initial **\"focus on the... foreground,\"** and the subsequent **\"shifting focus to the midground.\"** This is a precise and accurate analysis of the rack focus.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** Correctly states that the **\"camera remains static throughout, with no movement or shaking.\"**\n\n*   **Error:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The description of the camera being positioned at **\"eye level\"** is incorrect.\n        *   **Reasoning:** \"Eye-level\" implies the camera is positioned at the height of a subject's eyes, looking forward. In this video, the camera is positioned directly *above* the scene. The correct term from the instructions would be **\"overhead-level.\"**\n        *   **Contradiction:** The phrase \"positioned at eye level, using a bird's-eye view angle\" is a direct contradiction. A bird's-eye view is by definition an overhead shot, not an eye-level one.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is very complete and successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions for this specific video:\n    *   **Video Speed:** Covered.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Covered.\n    *   **Camera Height:** Covered (though inaccurately).\n    *   **Movements:** Covered (by stating it is static).\n    *   **Focus:** Covered in great detail.\n*   It correctly adheres to the instruction to omit details that are not present, such as lens distortion, Dutch angles, or complex camera movements. This contributes to its conciseness.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise while remaining informative, just as the instructions requested. It avoids unnecessary words.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology effectively (stop-motion, bird's-eye view, shallow depth of field, foreground, midground, static). The only failure in terminology is the use of \"eye level\" instead of \"overhead-level.\"\n*   **Structure:** The information is presented in a logical order, starting with the overall technique (stop-motion), moving to the camera's static position, and then detailing the dynamic change in focus.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the error and slightly improves conciseness, fully aligning with the instructions:\n\n**\"This stop-motion animation is filmed from a static, overhead-level camera using a bird's-eye angle. The shot employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus shifting from the foreground (hands and photo) to the midground (items in the drawer) as the photo is placed down.\"**\n\nThis revised version is more accurate by using \"overhead-level\" and is slightly more streamlined by removing redundant phrases like \"to look directly down at the scene\" (which is implied by \"bird's-eye angle\") and \"with no movement or shaking\" (which is implied by \"static\").",
