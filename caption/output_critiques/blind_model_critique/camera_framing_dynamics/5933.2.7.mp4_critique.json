    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant contradiction regarding the camera's movement, which is a key element of the analysis. While it correctly identifies the camera's height, angle, and focus, its description of the camera's stability is incorrect and confusing.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"shot at eye level with a level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned at the height of a standing person and is pointed straight ahead, parallel to the ground.\n    *   **\"maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field\"**: This is also correct. The foreground (grass, rocks), midground (the person), and background (mountains) are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"slightly unsteady\"**: This part is accurate on its own. The camera is clearly not on a tripod and exhibits the minor, natural shakiness of a handheld shot.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"The camera remains fixed\"**: This is the main error. A \"fixed\" camera is static and locked in place, typically on a tripod. This camera is handheld and constantly moving slightly. The phrase **\"fixed but slightly unsteady\"** is a direct contradiction. A camera cannot be both at the same time. The movement, though minimal, disqualifies it from being \"fixed.\"\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present (e.g., altered video speed, lens distortion, Dutch angle, focus changes).\n*   However, it fails to completely and accurately describe the camera's movement. Instead of a contradictory statement, it should have simply described the nature of the handheld movement. The instructions ask for a description of steadiness and movement type; the caption attempts this but fails to do so clearly.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\n\n*   **Good Adherence:**\n    *   The caption successfully describes **camera height, angle, and focus** as requested.\n    *   It is **concise**, as instructed.\n    *   It correctly avoids mentioning standard video speed or the absence of lens distortion.\n\n*   **Poor Adherence:**\n    *   The primary failure is in describing **camera movement**. The instructions provide a detailed list of terms (static, tracking, panning, steadiness, etc.). The caption uses the term \"fixed\" incorrectly and pairs it with a contradictory descriptor (\"unsteady\"), failing to provide a clear and accurate description of the movement as per the guidelines. A better description would have been to state the camera is **handheld and unsteady** with no deliberate panning, tilting, or other movements.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately reflects the video and fully adheres to your instructions:\n\n**\"Shot at eye-level with a level angle, the camera is handheld, resulting in slight unsteadiness. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire landscape sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Accurate Movement:** It correctly identifies the camera as \"handheld\" and the resulting motion as \"slight unsteadiness,\" which resolves the contradiction in the original caption.\n*   **Clear and Concise:** It remains concise while providing a more precise technical description.\n*   **Fully Adherent:** It accurately describes all the relevant camera configuration aspects present in the video according to the rules provided.",
