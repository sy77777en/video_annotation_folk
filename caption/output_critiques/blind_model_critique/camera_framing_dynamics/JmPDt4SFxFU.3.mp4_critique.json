    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions, providing a description that is accurate, concise, and complete according to the specified rules.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Perspective (\"level, ground-level\"):** This is an accurate and precise description. \"Ground-level\" correctly identifies the camera's low height, and \"level angle\" correctly indicates that the camera is not tilted up or down.\n*   **Focus (\"deep focus... sharp detail\"):** The caption correctly identifies the deep depth of field. More importantly, it explains *why* it's deep focus by noting that both the foreground (hunter, deer) and background (trees) are sharp. This adds valuable, verifiable detail.\n*   **Movement (\"quite unsteady, exhibiting slight, patternless movement\"):** This is a nuanced and highly accurate description. It correctly distinguishes the shot from a truly static one while also clarifying that the movement is not an intentional pan, tilt, or track, but rather the slight, random jitter characteristic of a handheld camera without stabilization.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what is not required:\n*   **Included:** Camera angle, height, focus depth, focus plane, and camera steadiness/movement are all covered.\n*   **Omitted:** The caption correctly adheres to the instruction to be concise by not mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, implying these are all standard/absent. This demonstrates a perfect understanding of the negative constraints in the prompt.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows every aspect of the provided instructions perfectly:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** In just two sentences, it paints a complete picture of the camera's configuration and behavior.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms like \"level,\" \"ground-level,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Describing Movement:** It accurately describes the camera's state as \"unsteady\" with \"patternless movement,\" which is the correct way to handle a shot that isn't perfectly static but has no deliberate motion.\n*   **Describing Focus:** It not only names the focus type (\"deep focus\") but also describes its effect on the foreground and background, as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is exceptionally good. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the prompt, using precise terminology to create a description that is both technically accurate and easy to understand. There are no weaknesses or areas for improvement.",
