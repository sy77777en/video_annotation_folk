    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, making actions appear slower than real-time. The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves backward while panning left, leading the man in the foreground. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward and panning left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but contains one major factual error and a few minor inaccuracies or omissions. While it follows the general structure of the instructions, its observational accuracy is flawed, particularly regarding the camera's focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\nHere is a point-by-point breakdown of the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**1. \"The video is in slow motion, making actions appear slower than real-time.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** **Correct.** The man's movements and the camera's motion are clearly slowed down.\n*   **Completeness:** **Good.** It correctly identifies the video speed alteration.\n*   **Adherence:** **Good.**\n\n**2. \"The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** **Partially Correct.**\n    *   \"Eye level\" is accurate. The camera is held at a height that looks directly at the subject.\n    *   \"Initially at a level angle\" is also accurate.\n    *   \"Shifts to a low angle\" is an **overstatement and likely inaccurate**. The camera does dip slightly, but this is a result of the unsteady, handheld walking motion, not a deliberate compositional shift to a low angle. The perspective on the subject remains largely level throughout.\n*   **Completeness:** It correctly addresses height and angle.\n*   **Adherence:** It follows the instruction to note angle shifts, but misinterprets the cause and effect of the movement.\n\n**3. \"It uses deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** **Major Error.** This is the most significant mistake in the caption. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**. The subject (the man) is in sharp focus, while the background (buildings, cars, trees) is significantly blurred. Deep focus would mean both the foreground and background are sharp.\n*   **Completeness:** It fails to accurately describe the focus. It also misses the opportunity to mention that the focus is **tracking** the subject as he moves.\n*   **Adherence:** It fails to adhere to the instruction for accurate focus description.\n\n**4. \"The camera moves backward while panning left, leading the man in the foreground.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** **Excellent.** This is a very precise and accurate description of the camera's movement. It correctly identifies the dolly-out (\"moves backward\"), the pan, and the purpose (\"leading the man\").\n*   **Completeness:** **Excellent.** This part perfectly captures the camera's primary motion.\n*   **Adherence:** **Excellent.**\n\n**5. \"The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\"**\n*   **Accuracy:** **Correct.** The camera has a distinct up-and-down bob and wobble characteristic of a handheld shot while walking.\n*   **Completeness:** **Good.** It accurately describes the steadiness of the shot.\n*   **Adherence:** **Good.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n\n*   **Major Error:** Incorrectly identifies a shallow depth of field as \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** Misinterprets a slight dip from unsteady movement as a deliberate shift to a \"low angle.\"\n*   **Omission:** Fails to mention that the focus is actively **tracking** the subject to keep him sharp.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a caption that more accurately and completely describes the video according to your instructions:\n\n**This slow-motion video is captured from an eye-level, level angle. It features a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in sharp focus against a heavily blurred background. The camera performs an unsteady, handheld movement, dollying backward and panning left to lead the subject, while continuously tracking focus on him.**",
