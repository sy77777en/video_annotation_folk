    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the over-the-shoulder perspective, hip-level height, and shallow depth of field, it lacks crucial detail and may be inaccurate in its description of movement. For instance, the video is likely in slow-motion to emphasize the muscular strain and form of the weightlifter, a critical detail that is completely omitted. The description of the camera as \"fixed but slightly unsteady\" is too simplistic; it's more probable that the handheld camera performs a subtle, slow tilt upward to follow the lifter's vertical motion as he rises, which contradicts the \"fixed\" claim. The term \"slightly unsteady\" could be more precisely described as \"exhibiting minor handheld micro-jitters.\" Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the significant out-of-focus foreground element—the shoulder and back of the person the camera is behind—which is essential to establishing the over-the-shoulder framing. It also misses the opportunity to specify the camera angle more precisely; from a hip-level height, the camera is likely tilted up slightly, creating a low angle shot that makes the subject appear more powerful. Finally, if the video included a hard cut to a close-up of the lifter's face or hands gripping the bar mid-lift, the current caption would be incomplete as it only describes a single, continuous shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera captures the scene from an over-the-shoulder perspective at hip-level, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the weightlifter in the midground sharply in focus. The foreground features the out-of-focus shoulder and back of the person in front, enhancing the framing. The camera angle is slightly tilted upward, creating a low-angle shot that emphasizes the lifter's power. The video is in slow-motion, highlighting the muscular strain and form of the lifter. The handheld camera exhibits minor micro-jitters and performs a subtle, slow tilt upward to follow the lifter's vertical motion. If the video includes a hard cut to a close-up of the lifter's face or hands gripping the bar, this would add dynamic contrast to the initial shot.",
