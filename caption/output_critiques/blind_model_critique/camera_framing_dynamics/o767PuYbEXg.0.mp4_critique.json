    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned above water, capturing the scene from a high angle. It maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera exhibits minor, smooth movement, tilting upwards.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera movements and deep focus, it lacks the specificity needed to fully capture the visual experience. The description of the camera as \"above water\" from a \"high angle\" is vague; a more precise term like \"aerial-level\" would better convey that this is likely a drone shot. The caption also misses the subtle *barrel distortion* from the wide-angle lens, which becomes apparent as a slight curvature of the horizon when the camera tilts up. The movement description, \"pans to the right before smoothly tilting upwards,\" is an oversimplification. The initial \"pan\" is more of a slow, clockwise *arc* that follows the curve of the coastline, revealing a small sailboat moored in a cove. The subsequent \"tilt\" is combined with a *crane up* motion, as the drone gains altitude to transform the high-angle view into a majestic, wide shot of the entire bay against the sky. Finally, the caption is purely technical and would be improved by mentioning the purpose of the movement—to first introduce the sailboat as a point of interest and then to reveal the grand scale of the coastal landscape.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, positioned at an aerial level likely from a drone, captures the scene with a deep focus and large depth of field, keeping the entire view sharp. It begins with a slow, clockwise arc following the curve of the coastline, revealing a small sailboat moored in a cove. As the camera moves, subtle barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens causes a slight curvature of the horizon. The movement transitions into a combined crane up and tilt motion, as the drone gains altitude to transform the high-angle view into a majestic, wide shot of the entire bay against the sky. This dynamic movement serves to first introduce the sailboat as a point of interest and then reveal the grand scale of the coastal landscape.",
