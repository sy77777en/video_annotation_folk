    "pre_caption": "Held at eye level, the camera captures a wide landscape with a deep focus, keeping the foreground and distant hills sharp. The camera performs an unsteady, shaky pan to the left while tilting slightly upward to follow the arc of a rainbow, transitioning the view from a level to a low angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans left with a slight tilt up, accompanied by noticeable shaking throughout the motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The caption correctly identifies the starting position as **eye level** and a **level angle**. It accurately notes the transition to a **low angle** as the camera tilts upward to look at the rainbow. This shows a strong understanding of how movement affects the viewing angle.\n*   **Focus:** The description of **deep focus** is precise, clarifying that both \"the foreground and distant hills\" are sharp. This correctly describes a large depth of field.\n*   **Movement:** The caption accurately identifies the complex movement as an **\"unsteady, shaky pan to the left while tilting slightly upward.\"** This single phrase effectively communicates the movement's type (pan, tilt), direction (left, upward), and quality (unsteady, shaky), implying a handheld shot.\n*   **Purpose:** It correctly identifies the *purpose* of the movement: \"to follow the arc of a rainbow,\" which adds valuable context.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects requested in the instructions for a single, continuous shot:\n    *   **Camera Height:** `eye level`\n    *   **Camera Angle:** `level to a low angle`\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus`\n    *   **Movements:** `unsteady, shaky pan to the left while tilting slightly upward`\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** `to follow the arc of a rainbow`\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary words. It packs a significant amount of technical information into two clear sentences.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** As instructed, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or **Dutch angle**, assuming they are standard/not present. This demonstrates a perfect understanding of the \"only mention if present\" rule.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology (pan, tilt, deep focus, low angle) correctly and effectively.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It is technically precise, information-rich, and written in a clear, concise manner that fully satisfies all constraints of the prompt.",
