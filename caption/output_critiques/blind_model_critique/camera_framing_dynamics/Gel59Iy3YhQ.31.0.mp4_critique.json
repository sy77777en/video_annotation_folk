    "pre_caption": "This is a high-angle, overhead shot from a game perspective. The camera initially arcs counterclockwise around the character while simultaneously moving downward and tilting up. It then becomes static, with some slight, unsteady shaking that reflects the movements of the giant squid ghost. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents a game perspective, arcing counterclockwise around the character while moving downward and tilting up simultaneously. Afterward, it remains static with some shaking, reflecting the movements of the giant squid ghost.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres very well to the specified format and terminology.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Excellent.** The description of the camera's configuration and movement is highly accurate.\n*   **Angle and Height:** \"high-angle, overhead shot\" is a perfect description of the initial framing.\n*   **Movement:** The breakdown of the initial complex movement is spot-on: \"arcs counterclockwise... while simultaneously moving downward and tilting up.\" This correctly identifies the three distinct, concurrent actions.\n*   **Steadiness:** The description of the second phase as \"static, with some slight, unsteady shaking\" is also very accurate. Correctly identifying that the primary movement ceases but is replaced by a subtle jitter is a key observation.\n*   **Focus:** \"maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\" is a correct assessment of the depth of field.\n\n### Completeness:\n*   **Very Good.** The caption covers almost all the required elements present in the video.\n*   **What it covers well:**\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** `high-angle, overhead`\n    *   **Movements:** `arcs counterclockwise`, `moving downward`, `tilting up`, `static`, `unsteady shaking`\n    *   **Purpose:** It provides a plausible purpose for the shaking (`reflects the movements of the giant squid ghost`), which is a great detail.\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus`\n*   **Minor point for improvement:** The instructions ask to note shifts in camera angle. The caption correctly identifies the initial high angle, but it could have mentioned that as the camera moves downward and tilts up, the angle transitions to a more **level angle** relative to the character by the end of the shot. This is a minor omission but would have made the description even more comprehensive.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Excellent.** The caption follows the instructions precisely.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise and informative, avoiding unnecessary words while packing in a lot of detail.\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** As instructed, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, since none are present. This shows a good understanding of the \"if present\" rule.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms from the instructions, such as `arcs`, `tilting`, `static`, and `deep focus`.\n*   **Temporal Order:** It describes the camera movements in the correct sequence (\"initially... then...\").\n\n### Final Verdict:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a high-quality description that is accurate, clear, and follows the detailed instructions almost perfectly. The one minor suggestion for improvement (noting the change in angle) is a fine point that doesn't detract from the overall quality of the caption.",
