    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** The camera remains completely static, holding a fixed shot on the 2D animated gumball machine.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation:**\n\nThe caption is **accurate** in what it states but is **incomplete** and does not fully adhere to the instructions provided.\n\n#### **1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **\"The camera remains completely static, holding a fixed shot...\"**: This is correct. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way throughout the video.\n*   **\"...on the 2D animated gumball machine.\"**: This accurately identifies the subject and the medium (2D animation).\n\nThe information present in the caption is factually correct.\n\n#### **2. Completeness: Poor**\n\nThe caption is overly concise and omits several key details required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Camera Angle and Height:** The instructions explicitly ask for the camera angle (e.g., level angle) and height (e.g., eye-level). The video is shot from a straight-on, **level angle** at a height that is **eye-level** relative to the gumball machine. This information is missing.\n*   **Missing Focus and Depth of Field Description:** The instructions require a description of the focus. While this 2D animation doesn't have a traditional depth of field, that characteristic itself should be noted. A proper description would mention that the image has a **flat focus** with **no depth of field**, which is typical for this style of animation.\n\n#### **3. Adherence to Instructions: Fair**\n\n*   **What it does well:** The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise and to omit details when they are standard (e.g., it doesn't mention the regular video speed or the lack of lens distortion, as per the instructions).\n*   **Where it falls short:** It fails to provide the \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration\" that the instructions demand. By only mentioning that the shot is static, it ignores the required points on **camera angle, camera height, and focus**, which are all discernible and relevant characteristics of the shot. The goal is to be concise *yet* informative, and this caption prioritizes conciseness to the point of being uninformative about key required elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Improved Caption Example:**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that would be both accurate and complete according to your instructions:\n\n**\"The shot is static, framed from an eye-level height and a level angle. As a 2D animation, the image has a flat focus with no depth of field.\"**\n\nThis improved version is still concise but successfully incorporates all the required descriptive elements for this specific video.",
