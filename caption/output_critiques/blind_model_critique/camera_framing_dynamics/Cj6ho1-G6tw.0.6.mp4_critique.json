    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video is shot from a high vantage point, showing a distant, low-lying ground and city. The camera's height relative to the platform where it is positioned transitions from hip level to eye level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery detail in the caption is a precise and correct description of the video's technical aspects:\n*   **\"From a high vantage point, the camera looks down at a high angle...\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned high above the city, and its perspective is angled downwards.\n*   **\"...and smoothly pedestals up from hip level to eye level.\"**: This is an excellent and technically correct description of the camera movement. \"Pedestal up\" is the precise term for a vertical camera lift. The movement is indeed smooth, and describing the height change relative to a person (\"hip level to eye level\") is a very effective way to quantify the movement on the platform.\n*   **\"The shot maintains a deep focus...\"**: This is correct. The depth of field is large, meaning elements at different distances from the camera are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"...keeping the stone platform in the foreground and the city in the background clear.\"**: This accurately identifies the elements in the foreground and background and confirms that they are both sharp, which is the definition of the deep focus mentioned.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present or is considered standard.\n*   **Included Elements**:\n    *   **Camera Angle**: \"high angle\"\n    *   **Camera Height**: \"high vantage point,\" \"hip level to eye level\"\n    *   **Movement**: \"smoothly pedestals up\" (covers type, steadiness, and direction)\n    *   **Focus**: \"deep focus,\" with a description of the focus plane (foreground and background)\n*   **Correctly Omitted Elements**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this does not need to be mentioned.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so this is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and content guidelines perfectly.\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: The caption is only two sentences long but packs in all the relevant technical details without any fluff.\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology**: It correctly uses technical terms like \"high angle,\" \"pedestal up,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Describes Movement and Focus Dynamically**: It clearly explains the camera's movement (\"pedestals up\") and the state of the focus throughout the shot (\"maintains a deep focus\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, comprehensive in its description of the relevant visual elements, and concise in its delivery.",
