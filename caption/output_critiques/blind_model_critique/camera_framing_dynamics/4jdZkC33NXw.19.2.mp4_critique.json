    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp. The camera moves forward and to the left with slight unsteadiness and shaking.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, complete according to the rules, and perfectly concise.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"Eye-level, level-angle\" is a precise description. The camera is held at a natural human height and is not tilted up or down.\n    *   **Focus:** \"Deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp\" is correct. All elements from the foreground pavement to the background buildings are in clear focus.\n    *   **Movement:** \"Moves forward and to the left\" accurately describes the camera's trajectory (a combination of a dolly forward and a truck left).\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"Slight unsteadiness and shaking\" perfectly captures the handheld quality of the shot, which is not perfectly smooth but also not excessively shaky.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption correctly identifies and includes all the key, non-standard attributes of the shot: **height, angle, focus, and movement (including steadiness)**.\n    *   It correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are considered \"normal\" or absent:\n        *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so it is correctly not mentioned.\n        *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n        *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this is correctly omitted.\n    *   The description of movement is clear and follows the instructions to describe the type, direction, and steadiness.\n\n*   **Conciseness:**\n    *   The caption is exceptionally concise. It conveys all the necessary information in just two clear sentences without any redundant words.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the technical aspects of the video and an ability to communicate them accurately and efficiently. There are no significant improvements to be made.",
