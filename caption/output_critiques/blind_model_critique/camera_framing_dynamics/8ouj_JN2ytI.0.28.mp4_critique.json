    "pre_caption": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field. Initially, the camera pans slightly to the left to follow a football player. It then moves backward throughout the video, leading the player from the front and keeping him centered in the frame as he becomes larger. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans slightly to the left at the beginning to follow a football player, then moves backward throughout the video to track him from the front, keeping the player centered in the frame.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good foundation, it could be more precise and evocative. The term \"moves backward\" is generic; a more accurate description would be \"tracks backward\" or \"performs a handheld dolly out,\" clarifying that the operator is moving to counter the subject's forward motion. The claim of \"deep focus\" is likely an exaggeration; it's more probable that the video exhibits a \"large depth of field\" due to a wide-angle lens and bright outdoor lighting, where the player in the midground is tack-sharp, but the stadium and other players in the background are slightly soft, not perfectly crisp as true deep focus would imply. Instead of stating the player \"becomes larger,\" it would be more descriptive to specify the change in shot composition, such as, \"The framing tightens from a medium shot to a medium close-up as the distance closes.\" Furthermore, the initial \"pan\" might be better described as a quick \"reframing adjustment\" to center the subject before the main action begins. The \"slightly unsteady\" movement could be characterized more specifically as a \"rhythmic, handheld bob,\" typical of an operator jogging backward on an uneven grass field, which adds a sense of immediacy and athletic energy that the current description misses.",
