    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is very good and accurately describes the key visual elements of the video according to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate, mostly complete, and adheres well to the instructions**, especially regarding conciseness. It correctly identifies the most prominent technical aspects of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\nEvery statement in the caption is correct.\n*   **\"static camera\"**: Correct. The camera does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom.\n*   **\"positioned at a low angle, looking up\"**: Correct. The camera is placed below the subject's eye line, creating a low-angle shot.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The background is significantly out of focus, which is the defining characteristic of a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"focusing on the man in the foreground, while the background remains blurred\"**: Correct. The plane of focus is clearly on the man, who occupies the foreground, rendering the background indistinct.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Good\n\nThe caption covers the most important elements, but it omits one detail requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **What it covers well:**\n    *   **Camera Movement:** Correctly identified as `static`.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Correctly identified as `low angle`.\n    *   **Focus/Depth of Field:** Correctly described as `shallow depth of field` with focus on the `foreground`.\n\n*   **What's missing:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The instructions ask for camera height (e.g., *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level*). While \"low angle\" implies a lower position, a more specific term like **\"hip-level\"** or **\"chest-level\"** would make the description more complete.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\n\nThe caption writer clearly understood and followed the rules provided.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and effective. It avoids unnecessary words.\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** Crucially, it follows the instruction: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"* The caption correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   Video speed (it's regular).\n    *   Lens distortion (there is none).\n    *   Dutch angle (the horizon is level).\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the precise, requested terminology (`static`, `low angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `foreground`).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion and Suggested Improvement\n\nThe caption is very strong. To make it perfect according to the provided instructions, you would only need to add the specific camera height.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> The video features a static camera positioned at a low angle, looking up. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground, while the background remains blurred.\n\n**Revised Caption for 100% Completeness:**\n> The video features a static, **hip-level** camera at a low angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground while the background remains blurred.",
