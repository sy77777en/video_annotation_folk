    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion, selfie-perspective shot leads a skier from the front. The camera moves backward and downward, transitioning from hip-level to ground-level, which shifts the view from a level to a low angle. The shot is slightly unsteady and features a varying Dutch angle from camera rolling, a gentle upward tilt, and a deep focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, in a selfie perspective, films a skier while moving backward and downward throughout the shot, with slight back-and-forth rolls and a gentle tilt upward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the slow-motion effect and the primary camera movements, it misses some key details and could be more precise. The most significant omission is the lack of any mention of lens distortion; a shot like this, likely filmed on an action camera, would almost certainly exhibit prominent barrel or fisheye distortion, causing the horizon and surrounding trees to appear curved. The description of the movement, \"moves backward,\" is ambiguous; it should clarify that the camera is moving backward *with the skier* (e.g., mounted on a selfie pole), not independently. Furthermore, the caption describes *what* the camera does but not *why*. The downward pedestal and upward tilt are purposeful, designed to shift the focus from the skier's face to a more dramatic low-angle view of their skis kicking up powder. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is correct, it could be more descriptive by noting that both the skier in the foreground and the mountain range in the background remain in sharp focus, which is characteristic of the wide-angle lens being used. The description of the \"varying Dutch angle\" is good, but it could be explicitly linked to the skier's carving turns, which cause the camera to roll.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This slow-motion, selfie-perspective shot captures a skier from the front, with the camera moving backward alongside the skier, likely mounted on a selfie pole. The camera transitions from hip-level to ground-level, shifting the view from a level to a dramatic low angle, emphasizing the skier's skis kicking up powder. The shot exhibits prominent barrel or fisheye distortion, typical of an action camera, causing the horizon and surrounding trees to appear curved. The camera's gentle upward tilt and varying Dutch angle are linked to the skier's carving turns, adding dynamic movement to the scene. Both the skier in the foreground and the mountain range in the background remain in sharp focus, highlighting the wide-angle lens's deep focus capability.",
