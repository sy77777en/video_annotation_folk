    "pre_caption": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward to tail-follow the skateboarder, who becomes smaller in the frame, and includes a minor pan to the right as the skateboarder performs a stunt. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward to tail-follow the skateboarder, with a minor pan to the right as the skateboarder performs a stunt.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the fisheye distortion and the shaky, ground-level perspective. However, the description of the movement is contradictory; a \"tail-follow\" implies maintaining a constant distance, yet the caption states the skateboarder \"becomes smaller in the frame.\" A more accurate description would be a forward tracking shot where the camera's speed decreases, allowing the skater to create distance and move into the midground before the stunt. Furthermore, the caption omits a key element typical of such videos: the use of slow-motion, which is likely employed during the stunt itself to highlight the action before the video returns to normal speed. The movement is also likely more complex, involving a slight upward tilt to follow the skater onto the obstacle, not just a pan. Finally, while the depth of field is large due to the lens, \"deep focus\" might be an overstatement; it's more probable that the focus is locked on the skater, leaving the immediate foreground and distant background slightly soft, rather than having every plane in sharp focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion and a shaky, ground-level perspective. The camera executes a forward tracking shot, initially maintaining a close distance to the skateboarder before its speed decreases, allowing the skater to move into the midground. As the skateboarder performs a stunt, the video likely employs slow-motion to emphasize the action before returning to normal speed. The camera movement includes a slight upward tilt to follow the skater onto the obstacle, along with a minor pan to the right. While the lens provides a large depth of field, the focus is primarily locked on the skateboarder, rendering the immediate foreground and distant background slightly soft.",
