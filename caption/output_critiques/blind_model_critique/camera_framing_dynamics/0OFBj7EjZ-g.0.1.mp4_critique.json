    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera trucks left while panning right to focus the building at the center of the frame throughout the video, ending with a quick zoom in to highlight it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions. Here is a breakdown of the feedback.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good** and highly accurate for the most part. It successfully captures the key technical aspects of the shot in a concise manner. However, there is one minor but important inaccuracy regarding the final camera movement, based on the specific definitions provided in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Highly Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** `\"aerial-level camera at a high angle\"` is perfectly accurate. The shot is clearly from a drone or similar high-altitude platform, looking down on the subject.\n    *   **Focus:** `\"employs deep focus with a large depth of field\"` is correct. The foreground trees, the midground building, and the background elements are all sharp and in focus.\n    *   **Primary Movement:** `\"smoothly trucks left while panning right to keep the building centered in the frame\"` is an excellent and technically precise description of the main camera motion. This combined movement creates the arcing/orbital effect around the building.\n\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:**\n    *   **Final Movement:** The caption states the camera performs a `\"quick zoom in\"`. This is incorrect based on the provided instructions. A **zoom** involves changing the lens's focal length, which flattens perspective. The video shows a **dolly in**, where the camera physically moves forward. You can tell because the perspective shifts naturally—objects in the foreground (like the trees on the right) move out of the frame faster than the building in the midground. The instructions specifically differentiate between `zooming` and `dollying`.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is very complete and adheres well to the instruction to be \"concise yet informative.\"\n*   It correctly covers the required elements that are present in the video:\n    *   **Camera Height:** `aerial-level`\n    *   **Camera Angle:** `high angle`\n    *   **Movements:** It details the type (`trucking`, `panning`, `dolly/zoom`), direction (`left`, `right`), steadiness (`smoothly`), speed (`quick` for the final move), and purpose (`to keep the building centered`, `to emphasize the building`).\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus`, `large depth of field`\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, as per the instructions:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption adheres almost perfectly to the instructions. It uses the specified terminology for camera height, angle, and movement types.\n*   It successfully describes the complex, combined movement (`trucks left while panning right`) and its purpose, which is a key part of the instruction.\n*   The only point of non-adherence is the use of `\"zoom in\"` instead of the more precise term `\"dolly in\"`, which the instructions explicitly define as a physical camera movement forward. While \"zoom\" is often used colloquially for any move that gets closer, these specific instructions require the technical distinction.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo make the caption fully accurate and compliant with the instructions, the final phrase should be corrected.\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\n> The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly trucks left while panning right to keep the building centered in the frame, concluding with a quick **dolly in** to emphasize the building.",
