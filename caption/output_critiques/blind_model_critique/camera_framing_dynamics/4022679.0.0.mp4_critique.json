    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in focus. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking; it tilts upward while panning left, then jitters downward to re-center on the man, finishing with a subtle pan to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts upward while panning left, then jitters downward as it tries to focus on the person, finishing with a subtle pan to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, such as the video speed and depth of field. However, it contains significant inaccuracies in its description of the camera movement, which is a critical component of the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is indeed in **slow-motion**.\n    *   **Camera Height:** The shot is filmed from **eye-level**.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly identifies the **shallow depth of field** and that the focus is on the **man in the foreground**.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The description of the movement as **\"smooth with minimal shaking\"** is accurate for a handheld shot.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **Pan Direction:** The caption states the camera is **\"panning left\"**. This is incorrect. As the man turns his head up and to his left (screen right), the camera **pans right** to follow him.\n    *   **Movement Description:** The word **\"jitters\"** is inaccurate. \"Jitter\" implies a shaky, nervous, or erratic movement. The camera's downward movement is a smooth and deliberate **tilt** to re-center the subject's face.\n    *   **Final Movement:** The caption claims the shot finishes with a **\"subtle pan to the right.\"** This is also incorrect. The main pan to the right happens earlier. At the very end, there is a very slight corrective pan to the **left** as the man's head settles.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but misses a few key descriptive elements requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** It mentions camera height (\"eye-level\") but omits the camera angle. The shot uses a **level angle**, which could have been included.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement. The caption describes the individual pans and tilts but fails to state their overarching purpose, which is to **track** the subject. Describing the movement as \"tracking the man's head\" would be more informative and complete.\n*   **Lens Distortion/Dutch Angle:** The caption correctly omits these as they are not present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to some instructions but fails on others, primarily due to the inaccuracies.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is commendably concise.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses terms like \"slow-motion,\" \"eye-level,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"pan,\" and \"tilt.\"\n*   **Movement Description:** While it attempts to describe the movement in temporal order as requested, the factual errors in direction and characterization (\"jitters\") make it a poor execution of this instruction. It fails to accurately describe the **direction** and **complexity** of the movement.\n\n---\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the errors and better aligns with the instructions:\n\n**This slow-motion, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the foreground in focus. The camera performs a smooth, handheld tracking movement, first tilting up and panning right to follow the man's head, and then tilting back down to keep him centered in the frame.**",
