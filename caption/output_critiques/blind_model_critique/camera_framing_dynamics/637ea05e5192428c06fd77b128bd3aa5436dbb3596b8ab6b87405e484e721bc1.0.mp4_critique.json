    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery technical detail mentioned in the caption is correct:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** The camera is indeed at an **aerial-level** with a **level angle**, looking straight ahead over the landscape.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The camera is **moving smoothly forward** without any noticeable shaking, panning, or tilting.\n*   **Focus:** The video uses **deep focus**, keeping everything from the nearby trees to the distant mountains and clouds sharp and in focus.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what isn't relevant, as per the instructions:\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes the key features of the shot: camera height, angle, movement, and focus.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video plays at a regular speed, so there was no need to mention it.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible lens distortion, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so there was no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Complex Movements:** The movement is simple (moving forward), so there was no need to describe panning, tilting, arcing, etc.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions' nuances:\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise and informative, packing all the relevant technical details into two clear sentences without unnecessary words.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., `aerial-level`, `level angle`, `deep focus`).\n*   **Conditional Reporting:** This is where the caption truly excels. It follows the rule \"If [feature] is present, describe it.\" By not mentioning video speed, distortion, or complex movements, it correctly implies they are standard or absent, which is exactly what the instructions requested.\n*   **Clarity:** The description is easy to understand and provides a complete technical picture of the shot.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, efficient, and demonstrates a keen eye for both the visual details in the video and the specific requirements of the prompt.",
