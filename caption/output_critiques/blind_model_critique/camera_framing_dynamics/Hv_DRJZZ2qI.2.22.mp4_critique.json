    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting down and panning left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning leftward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the high-angle perspective and the basic tracking motion, it oversimplifies the camera work and misses key dynamic elements likely present in such a video. The description of the movement as a \"pan left and tilt down\" suggests a static camera rotating on an axis, whereas the visual would more likely involve a drone or cable-cam performing a complex movement, such as **trucking left while craning down** to move parallel with the biker, maintaining a consistent distance and creating a more immersive feel. The claim of a constant \"deep focus\" might also be inaccurate; it's more probable that as the camera gets closer to the action, the focus shifts to a **shallower depth of field** to isolate the rider from the busy canyon background, or it could be actively **focus tracking** the subject. Furthermore, an action shot of this nature would almost certainly feature a moment of **slow-motion** as the biker executes a jump or a difficult maneuver, a critical detail that is completely omitted. Finally, the camera angle likely evolves; it may start as a high-angle shot but could transition to a more **level or even a low-angle shot** as it descends with the rider, increasing the sense of speed and danger, a nuance the current description fails to capture.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dynamic and immersive sequence, likely using a drone or cable-cam to truck left while craning down, maintaining a consistent distance from the mountain biker as they navigate wooden ramps in the canyon. The camera work evolves from a high-angle perspective to a more level or low-angle shot, enhancing the sense of speed and danger. As the camera moves closer, the focus shifts to a shallower depth of field, isolating the rider from the canyon background, with active focus tracking to keep the subject sharp. A moment of slow-motion highlights the biker's jump or difficult maneuver, adding drama to the action-packed scene.",
