    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning rightward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **very good** and highly accurate. It successfully captures the most prominent visual characteristics of the shot in a concise manner. However, it falls slightly short of being fully complete according to the detailed instructions, as it omits one key detail about the camera's focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**. Every statement it makes correctly describes the video:\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at ground level with a low angle, looking up.\"** - **Correct.** The camera is clearly placed on or very near the floor, and its perspective is angled upward toward the child.\n*   **\"It uses deep focus with a large depth of field.\"** - **Correct.** Both the child in the midground and the people/furniture in the background are in sharp focus, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera smoothly pans right to follow the child...\"** - **Correct.** The camera rotates horizontally from left to right on a fixed axis. The movement is steady and its purpose is to keep the child centered in the frame.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **mostly complete** but misses one specific detail requested in the instructions.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the **camera height** (ground level), **camera angle** (low angle), **focus/depth of field** (deep focus), and **camera movement** (smooth pan right to follow).\n*   It correctly omits details like video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as they are not present, which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n\n**What's missing:**\n*   **Dynamic Focus Change:** The instructions state, \"If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* or *focus tracking*.\" In the video, the focus remains locked on the child as they move from left to right. This is a clear example of **focus tracking**. The caption describes the *state* of the focus (deep) but not its *dynamic action* (tracking).\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions, particularly regarding conciseness and clarity.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is excellent in its brevity. It avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"to follow\" instead of \"tracking,\" which is acceptable) and doesn't mention non-existent features.\n*   **Informativeness:** It provides a solid, informative overview of the shot's configuration.\n*   **Following Specific Rules:** It correctly follows the rule to omit descriptions of normal video speed and the absence of distortion.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The primary point of non-adherence is the failure to describe the **focus tracking**, which was explicitly requested in the instructions for dynamic focus.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption for Better Adherence\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the missing detail to be fully compliant with the instructions:\n\n**\"Positioned at ground-level with a low angle, the camera smoothly pans right to follow a child. The shot maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, and the focus actively tracks the child as they move across the midground.\"**\n\nThis revised version is slightly more detailed but remains concise while fully addressing all relevant points from your instructions, including the dynamic nature of the focus.",
