    "pre_caption": "The video features a static camera positioned at an overhead level, approximately at the height of a second floor, looking straight ahead with a level angle. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire basketball court scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant error regarding the camera angle. While it correctly identifies the camera's lack of movement, its height, and the deep focus, the description of the angle is incorrect, which fundamentally misrepresents how the shot is framed.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"static camera\"**: This is accurate. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way throughout the video.\n    *   **\"approximately at the height of a second floor\"**: This is an excellent and accurate estimation of the camera's elevated position.\n    *   **\"It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire basketball court scene\"**: This is also correct. The players in the midground, the net in the foreground, and the buildings in the background are all in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"positioned at an overhead level\"**: This is slightly misleading. While the camera is high up, the term \"overhead\" often implies a \"bird's-eye view\" (looking straight down at 90 degrees). A more precise term for the angle is \"high angle.\" The height itself is simply \"elevated.\"\n    *   **\"looking straight ahead with a level angle\"**: This is the most significant error. A **level angle** means the camera is parallel to the ground. From a second-story height, a level angle would capture the building across the street, not the court below. The camera is clearly tilted downwards to capture the scene, making it a **high angle shot**.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise as requested and covers the most prominent features. According to the instructions, \"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\" The caption correctly omits these details, making it appropriately complete and not overly verbose. It successfully covers:\n*   **Movement:** (Static)\n*   **Height:** (Second floor)\n*   **Angle:** (Incorrectly identified, but an attempt was made)\n*   **Focus:** (Deep focus)\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the instruction for conciseness by leaving out non-notable aspects (regular speed, no distortion).\n*   It correctly uses the term \"static\" as instructed for a non-moving camera.\n*   It correctly describes the \"deep focus\" and its effect.\n*   It fails to adhere to the instruction for accurately describing the **camera angle**, using \"level angle\" instead of the correct term, **\"high angle.\"**\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a corrected version of the caption that accurately reflects the video according to your instructions:\n\n**The video is captured from a static camera at an elevated height, approximately at the level of a second floor, using a high angle to look down on the action. The shot maintains deep focus, ensuring the entire basketball court and its surroundings remain clear.**",
