    "pre_caption": "This is a drone shot featuring advanced and complex camera work. The camera flies forward and descends over a green field, starting from an aerial, high-angle view and smoothly tilting up to transition to an eye-level, level-angle perspective. During this smooth flight, the camera also rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire landscape sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an aerial level and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone camera flies forward and descends toward the ground, tilting up to transition from a high angle to a level angle. During the flight, it also rolls, showcasing advanced and complex maneuvers.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres closely to the provided guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Verdict:** The caption is **excellent** and almost perfectly fulfills the instructions. It accurately captures the complex nature of the shot with clear and concise language.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **\"drone shot featuring advanced and complex camera work\"**: **Correct.** The simultaneous combination of descending, flying forward, tilting, and rolling is indeed complex and typical of advanced FPV (First-Person View) drone piloting.\n*   **\"flies forward and descends\"**: **Correct.** This accurately describes the primary translational movements.\n*   **\"starting from an aerial, high-angle view\"**: **Correct.** The shot begins high above the ground, looking down.\n*   **\"smoothly tilting up to transition to a... level-angle perspective\"**: **Correct.** The camera's vertical rotation from a downward-facing to a forward-facing angle is a tilt-up, and it ends at a level angle.\n*   **\"transition to an eye-level... perspective\"**: **Slightly Inaccurate.** This is the only minor point of inaccuracy. The camera ends up very close to the ground, significantly lower than a person's eye level. A more accurate term would be **\"low-level\"** or **\"ground-level\"**.\n*   **\"camera also rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle\"**: **Perfectly Correct.** This is an excellent observation. The camera clearly rotates on its z-axis, causing the horizon to tilt, and this tilt changes throughout the movement.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire landscape sharp\"**: **Perfectly Correct.** From the grass in the immediate foreground to the trees and sky in the far background, everything remains in sharp focus.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete and covers nearly all the required elements from the instructions.\n\n*   **Video Speed**: The caption correctly omits this, as the video is at a regular speed, and the instructions state to leave it out in such cases.\n*   **Lens Distortion**: Correctly omitted, as there is no significant distortion.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height**: Excellent. It describes both the starting and ending angles/heights and the transition between them.\n*   **Movements**: Excellent. It describes the translation (forward, descend), rotation (tilting, rolling), and complexity.\n*   **Focus**: Excellent. It correctly identifies the deep focus and large depth of field.\n*   **Steadiness**: The caption implies this with the word \"smoothly,\" but it could have been stated more explicitly (e.g., \"The movement is perfectly steady\"). However, \"smoothly\" is sufficient and keeps the description concise.\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the most important and dynamic aspects of the shot while correctly omitting the static or \"normal\" ones.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a large amount of technical information into just a few sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Describes Configuration**: It covers all the key configuration points: angle, height, movement, and focus.\n*   **Handles Omissions Correctly**: It correctly leaves out mentions of normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, as instructed.\n*   **Describes Movement Dynamically**: It explains how the camera's position and orientation change over time (\"starting from... and smoothly tilting up to transition to...\").\n*   **Identifies Complex Movements**: It correctly identifies the combination of movements (translation, tilt, and roll) happening simultaneously.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis is a model caption that could be used as a prime example of how to follow the given instructions. The only room for improvement is the minor correction of \"eye-level\" to \"low-level\" or \"ground-level\" to be perfectly precise. Otherwise, it is an outstanding execution of the task.",
