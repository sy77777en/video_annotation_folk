    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect example of how to apply the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the provided guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The camera is indeed at **eye level** with the subject and maintains a **level angle** throughout the shot.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The movement is precisely an **arc counterclockwise** around the drummer. This is a much more accurate and descriptive term than a simple \"pan\" or \"dolly.\"\n*   **Focus:** The **focus is shallow**, correctly identifying that the subject (the man) is sharp while the background is soft and out of focus.\n*   **Steadiness:** The description of the movement as **unsteady with noticeable shaking** is accurate, reflecting the handheld nature of the shot.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information present in the video without adding superfluous details.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the key elements: **camera height, angle, movement (type, direction, steadiness), and focus (depth, plane).**\n*   It correctly omits information that is not present or is standard, as per the instructions. For example:\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this is correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so there is no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into three clear, easy-to-read sentences.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions, such as \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"arcing counterclockwise,\" and \"shallow focus.\"\n*   **Logical Structure:** The caption is well-organized. It first establishes the camera's position and primary movement, then describes the focus, and finally adds a qualifier about the quality of the movement (steadiness).\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary execution of the instructions. It is precise, comprehensive in its coverage of the relevant visual information, and concise in its delivery.",
