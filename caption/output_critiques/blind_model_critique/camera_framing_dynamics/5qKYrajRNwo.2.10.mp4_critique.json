    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is **excellent** for this video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n\n*   **\"The stop-motion video...\"**: This is the correct technical term for the video's speed and style. The movement is not simply sped up; it's created from a sequence of still images, which is the definition of stop-motion.\n*   **\"...camera positioned at hip level with a low angle...\"**: This is a precise description. The camera is clearly below the subject's eye level, pointing upward, creating a low-angle shot that makes the character feel prominent. \"Hip level\" is an accurate estimation of the height.\n*   **\"The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady...\"**: This is an outstanding observation. While the camera does not pan, tilt, or dolly (making it \"fixed\" or static), there is a very subtle jitter or wobble between frames, which is common in stop-motion setups. Acknowledging this \"slight unsteadiness\" demonstrates a keen eye for detail.\n*   **\"...focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field...\"**: This is perfectly correct. The character and the box are sharp and occupy the midground of the frame. The background wall is visibly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"...highlighting the character interacting with a box.\"**: This correctly identifies the subject of focus and the purpose of the chosen camera configuration.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present:\n\n*   **Video Speed**: Correctly identified as *stop-motion*.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height**: Both *low angle* and *hip level* are specified.\n*   **Movements**: Correctly described as *fixed* (static) but also notes the subtle *unsteadiness*.\n*   **Focus**: Correctly identifies the *focus plane (midground)* and *depth of field (shallow)*.\n*   **Omissions**: As per the instructions, the caption correctly omits any mention of lens distortion, Dutch angles, or shot transitions, as none are present in the video.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs all the necessary technical details into a single, well-structured, and easy-to-read sentence.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It uses the precise terms requested, such as \"stop-motion,\" \"low angle,\" \"hip level,\" \"fixed,\" \"midground,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n*   **Follows Omission Rules**: It demonstrates an understanding of the instructions by not mentioning attributes that are absent (e.g., no distortion, no camera movement).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a flawless execution of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly concise.",
