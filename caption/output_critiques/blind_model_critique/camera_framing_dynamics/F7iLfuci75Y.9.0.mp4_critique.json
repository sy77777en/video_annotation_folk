    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward, moving up, and tilting down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate in its core observations, concise, and uses appropriate terminology. However, it could be improved by being more complete in describing the *change* that occurs during the shot, as specified in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"This is an eye-level, level-angle shot...\"**: This is **partially accurate**. The shot *begins* at eye-level with a level angle, but it does not *remain* there. The entire point of the camera movement is to transition from this starting position to a higher position and a downward-looking (high) angle. The caption accurately describes the start but misrepresents the shot as a whole by not mentioning the change.\n*   **\"...with a shallow depth of field that keeps the figures at their computers in the midground in focus.\"**: This is **highly accurate**. The depth of field is indeed shallow, and the focus plane is correctly identified as the midground where the workers are.\n*   **\"The camera executes a very smooth, combined movement...\"**: This is **highly accurate**. The movement is exceptionally smooth (likely on a gimbal or crane) and is a complex, combined motion.\n*   **\"...simultaneously moving forward and pedestaling upward while tilting down.\"**: This is **highly accurate**. The caption correctly deconstructs the complex movement into its three core components:\n    *   **Moving forward:** Correct (a dolly-in).\n    *   **Pedestaling upward:** Correct.\n    *   **Tilting down:** Correct.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is good but incomplete according to the detailed instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Information:**\n    *   **Change in Angle/Height:** The instructions state, \"If height changes... mention how it transitions\" and \"specify the camera angle... noting any shifts within the video.\" The caption fails to mention that the shot transitions from a **level angle** to a **high angle** and from **eye-level** to **above eye-level**. This is the most significant omission.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** While not strictly required, the instructions mention describing the purpose if relevant. Here, the movement serves to reveal the office space and transition from a personal, grounded perspective to a more detached, observational one. Adding this would enhance the description.\n    *   **Speed of Movement:** The movement is slow and deliberate. While \"very smooth\" implies control, explicitly stating the speed (\"slow,\" \"deliberate\") would add more detail as per the instructions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption adheres well to the instruction for conciseness. It correctly avoids mentioning normal video speed, the absence of lens distortion, and the lack of a Dutch angle.\n*   **Terminology:** The caption uses the specified terms \"pedestaling\" and \"tilting\" well. While it uses \"moving forward\" instead of \"dollying,\" this is perfectly acceptable and clear.\n*   **Describing Change Over Time:** This is the main area where the caption falls short of the instructions. It describes the camera's actions but not the resulting change in perspective (the shift from level to high angle).\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to all instructions:\n\n**\"The shot begins at eye-level with a level angle and a shallow depth of field that holds the midground figures in focus. The camera then performs a single, very smooth, and slow combined movement, simultaneously dollying forward, pedestaling upward, and tilting down. This motion transitions the view into a high-angle shot by the end, revealing more of the office space from above.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n1.  **Describes the Full Arc:** It correctly identifies the starting point (\"begins at eye-level with a level angle\") and the end state (\"transitions the view into a high-angle shot\").\n2.  **More Precise Terminology:** It uses \"dollying forward\" which is slightly more technical but still clear.\n3.  **Adds Speed:** It includes the detail that the movement is \"slow.\"\n4.  **Mentions Purpose (Implicitly):** It notes that the movement's effect is \"revealing more of the office space from above,\" which hints at the purpose.",
