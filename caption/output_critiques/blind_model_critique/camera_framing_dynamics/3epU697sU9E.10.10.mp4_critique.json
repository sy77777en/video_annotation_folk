    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video initially appears out of focus, but it quickly transitions into deep focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed instructions provided. It successfully captures all the key technical and descriptive elements of the shot in a single, clear sentence.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n\n*   **\"low-angle, eye-level shot\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera is at the eye-level of a standing person but is tilted slightly upward to capture the people and the ceiling-mounted TV, making it a low-angle shot.\n*   **\"begins out of focus before quickly sharpening into deep focus\"**: This is a precise description of the focus pull. The video starts completely blurry, the focus shifts rapidly, and the final shot has a large depth of field where both the people in the midground and the office details in the background are sharp.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady zoom-out\"**: This correctly identifies both the camera movement (a zoom, not a dolly) and its quality (a slight handheld shake).\n*   **\"revealing more of the office environment...\"**: This accurately describes the purpose and result of the zoom-out, which is to establish the setting and context of the scene. The description of the content (people watching a TV) is also correct.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, including all relevant information while correctly omitting unnecessary details as per the instructions.\n\n*   **Included:** It covers camera angle, height, focus changes (initial state, transition, and final state), and camera movement (type, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates an outstanding adherence to the provided guidelines.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption packs a significant amount of technical information into one fluid, easy-to-read sentence without feeling cluttered. This is the ideal execution of the instruction.\n*   **Technical Terminology:** It correctly uses terms specified in the instructions, such as \"low-angle,\" \"eye-level,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"zoom-out.\"\n*   **Describing Movement and Focus:** It follows the instructions perfectly by describing the initial state, the change, and the final state for focus. It also describes the movement's type, quality (steadiness), and purpose.\n*   **Temporal Order:** The description follows the chronological order of events in the video: focus pull first, then the zoom-out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the given instructions. It is difficult to improve upon. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly concise.",
