    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera smoothly pans left and moves forward, focusing on the rotating arm of a yellow construction crane.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt and correctly identifies some key aspects like the subject and the deep focus. However, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's angle and primary movement, failing to use the precise terminology required by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** `From an eye-level perspective...`\n    *   The camera is positioned significantly above the main subject (the wooden crane mechanism) and is looking down. This is a **high angle**, not an eye-level shot. An eye-level shot would be parallel to the ground and the subject's horizontal plane.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:** `...the camera smoothly pans left...`\n    *   This is the most critical error. A **pan** is a rotational movement where the camera pivots horizontally on a fixed axis. In the video, the entire camera is moving sideways from right to left. This movement is called **trucking left**. While there might be a very slight corrective pan to keep the subject centered, the dominant and defining movement is a truck.\n\n*   **Accurate:** `...and moves forward...`\n    *   The camera is indeed moving forward toward the subject. The correct term for this is **dollying forward**. \"Moves forward\" is acceptable but \"dollies forward\" is more precise.\n\n*   **Accurate:** `...focusing on the rotating arm of a wooden crane.`\n    *   This correctly identifies the subject and the purpose of the camera's framing.\n\n*   **Accurate:** `The shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground to the distant mountains sharp.`\n    *   This is an excellent and precise description. The depth of field is very large, and all planes of the image are in sharp focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the subject, movement, and focus.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angles, as none are present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n*   However, it is incomplete in its description of the movement. It fails to capture the compound nature of the shot, which is a simultaneous **truck, dolly, and slight pan**. By mislabeling the primary movement, it presents an incomplete picture.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which is good.\n*   **Terminology:** This is where the caption fails to adhere to the instructions. The instructions provide a specific list of movement types (tracking, arcing, craning, dollying, trucking, panning, etc.). The caption uses \"pans left\" when it should have used **\"trucks left\"**. Using the correct terminology is a core requirement of the prompt.\n*   **Angle/Height:** The instructions ask for a description of the camera angle and height. The caption attempts this but provides an incorrect description (\"eye-level\" instead of \"high angle\").\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and better adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"From a high angle, the camera smoothly trucks left and dollies forward, keeping the rotating arm of a wooden crane centered in the frame. The shot maintains a deep focus, rendering the entire scene from the foreground machinery to the distant mountains perfectly sharp.\"**",
