    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's position and angle. While it correctly identifies the focus and movement, these errors make it a poor description of the shot's configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Focus:** The description of \"deep focus and a large depth of field\" is **accurate**. The foreground (snow), midground (the man), and background (trees) are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **Movement Type:** The phrase \"moves forward, following the man from behind\" is a **correct** and clear description of the camera's primary action.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The mention of \"slight unsteadiness and some shaking\" is **accurate**. The movement is consistent with a person walking while holding the camera.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The caption states the camera is at **\"eye level,\" which is incorrect.** The camera is positioned significantly lower than the subject's head and shoulders, likely around the operator's hip or chest. A more accurate description would be **hip-level** or **chest-level**.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption claims a **\"level angle,\" which is also incorrect.** Because the camera is positioned low, it is tilted noticeably **upward** to keep the man's upper body in the frame. This is a **low angle** shot, not a level one.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is concise, as requested, but it could be more precise by incorporating more of the specified terminology.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard and not noteworthy, adhering to the instruction to be concise.\n*   While \"moves forward, following\" is correct, using the more technical terms **\"dollying forward\"** and **\"tracking\"** would align more closely with the detailed options provided in the instructions.\n*   The caption doesn't explicitly state the purpose of the movement, which is to create a first-person or \"follow-cam\" perspective, immersing the viewer in the action of walking behind the subject.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption successfully adheres to the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Required Elements:** It attempts to cover the required elements (height, angle, focus, movement, steadiness). However, it fails on the accuracy of height and angle.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses layman's terms for movement (\"moves forward, following\") instead of the more specific technical terms (\"dollying,\" \"tracking\") encouraged by the instructions.\n*   **Omissions:** It correctly follows the negative constraints by not mentioning normal video speed, the absence of lens distortion, or the lack of a Dutch angle.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and better aligns with the instructions:\n\n**\"From a hip-level, low-angle perspective, the camera tracks a man from behind, dollying forward with slight unsteadiness. The shot maintains deep focus, keeping the entire snowy scene sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this is better:**\n*   **Accurate Height & Angle:** Correctly identifies the position as \"hip-level\" and \"low-angle.\"\n*   **Precise Terminology:** Uses \"tracking\" and \"dollying\" as suggested in the instructions.\n*   **Informative & Concise:** It remains concise while providing a much more accurate and complete picture of the camera's configuration and movement.",
