    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and the extremely shallow depth of field, it oversimplifies the visual experience and misses key details from the prompt. Calling the shot \"static\" is likely inaccurate; in a handheld close-up of hands, there would almost certainly be subtle, natural micro-movements or a gentle sway from the operator's breathing, which should be noted as \"nearly static\" or \"handheld with minimal tremor.\" The term \"close-up\" could also be more precise—an \"extreme close-up\" that frames tightly on the interaction between the fingertips and the cable's frayed texture, perhaps excluding the rest of the hand, would be more descriptive. Furthermore, the description of focus is incomplete. While it correctly identifies the foreground focus plane, it fails to describe the character of the out-of-focus background, which might be a soft, unidentifiable bokeh of warm tones from an indoor lamp, for instance. The caption also completely omits the camera's angle and height; for example, the video could be shot from a slightly high, level angle, looking down at the hands as if they are resting on a table. Finally, the focus itself might not be perfectly fixed; there could be a subtle \"focus breathing\" or a very slow, almost imperceptible drift as the fingers adjust their grip, which would add another layer of dynamic detail missing from the current description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a handheld, nearly static extreme close-up shot, capturing the interaction between fingertips and the frayed white cable's texture. The extremely shallow depth of field highlights the cable in the foreground, while the background dissolves into a soft, warm-toned bokeh, possibly from an indoor lamp. The camera is positioned at a slightly high, level angle, looking down as if the hands are resting on a table. Subtle micro-movements and a gentle sway from the operator's breathing are present, along with a slow, almost imperceptible focus drift as the fingers adjust their grip.",
