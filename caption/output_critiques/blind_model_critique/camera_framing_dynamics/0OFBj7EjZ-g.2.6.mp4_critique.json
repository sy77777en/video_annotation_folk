    "pre_caption": "The video features a high-angle aerial view with deep focus, capturing a person seated at a desk. The camera moves upward smoothly and slowly, maintaining a steady shot throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **good but could be improved** for better precision and completeness according to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\nThe caption is factually correct on all points:\n*   **Angle/Height:** The shot is indeed a high-angle view that could be described as aerial, especially as it moves higher.\n*   **Focus:** The video clearly uses deep focus, as both the subject at the desk and the surrounding environment are sharp.\n*   **Movement:** The camera does move upward in a smooth, slow, and steady manner.\n\n**2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions: Good, but with omissions.**\nThe caption follows the rule of being concise by omitting details like normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion. However, it misses some key descriptive details requested in the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle/Height Transition:** The instructions ask to note shifts in angle and height. The shot begins at a **high angle** and transitions to a more direct **bird's-eye view** as it moves up. The caption simplifies this to \"high-angle aerial view\" without describing the change.\n*   **Specific Movement Terminology:** The instructions ask for specific movement types like \"pedestaling\" or \"craning.\" The caption uses the general phrase \"moves upward,\" which is less descriptive than the more technical term **\"pedestals up\"** (moving the entire camera vertically up).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption provides a good, easily understandable summary. However, to fully adhere to the detailed technical instructions, it should incorporate more specific terminology for the movement and describe the transition in the camera's angle.\n\n### Improved Caption Example:\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely follows the instructions:\n\n\"From a high angle, the camera steadily and slowly **pedestals up**, transitioning into a **bird's-eye view** of a person at a desk. The shot maintains a **deep focus** throughout.\"",
