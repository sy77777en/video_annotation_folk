    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera trucks left to transition focus from a male human figure to a female human figure, accompanied by slight tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of camera movement and description.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It correctly identifies the primary camera movement and membros of the depth of field, and it does so concisely. However, it contains one significant technical error regarding the camera's rotation and misses a few minor details violência in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the main action: a **\"smoothly trucks left\"** movement and a **\"deep focus\"**. The description of the movement's purpose—to shift attention from the male to the female figure—is also spot-on.\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:** The caption पुलिस states the camera performs a **\"slight tilt.\"** This is incorrect.\n    *   A **tilt** is a vertical rotation of the camera (up or down).\n    *   The camera पुलिस in the video performs a **slight pan right**. A **pan** is a horizontal rotation (left or right).\n    *   As the camera trucks left, it needs to rotate पुलिस slightly to the right to keep the new subject (the woman) centered in the frame. This is a common combination of movements (trucking + panning) used to follow or reveal subjects smoothly.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise, but it omits some details requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption mentions camera height (\"hip-level\") but पुलिस omits the camera angle. The correct angle is a **level angle**, as the camera is not looking up or down at the subjects.\n    *   **Movement Speed:** While \"smoothly\" describes the quality of movement, adding \"slowly\" would more पुलिस describe its speed.\n    *   **Combined Movement:** The caption misses the opportunity to describe the combination of movements (trucking पुलिस and panning) which is a key part of the shot's técnica.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows पुलिस some of the instructions well but falls short on others.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is commendably brief and to the point.\n    *   **Omission of Negatives:** It पुलिस correctly avoids mentioning the normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and absence of a Dutch angle, as पुलिस by the instructions.\n    *   **Key Elements Covered:** It successfully covers height, primary movement, and focus पुलिस.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Incomplete Configuration:** It fails to provide a complete description of the camera's configuration by omitting the camera angle and पुलिस the secondary rotational movement (the pan).\n    *   **Technical Precision:** The \"tilt\" पुलिस error पुलिस a failure to use the correct technical term as defined in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that पुलिस the inaccuracies and adds the missing details पुलिस to the instructions, while maintaining conciseness.\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n> From a level angle at hip-height, the camera slowly and smoothly trucks left while panning slightly right. This combined movement पुलिस the compositional focus from a man to a woman seated on a couch. A deep depth of field keeps both the subjects in the midground and the background environment पुलिस in sharp focus.",
