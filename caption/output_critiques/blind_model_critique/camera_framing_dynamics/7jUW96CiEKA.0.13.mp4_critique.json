    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions. Here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant error regarding the camera angle. While it correctly identifies several key aspects like the static nature of the camera and the deep focus, the mischaracterization of the angle is a major flaw. It also includes some descriptive content about the scene that, while not incorrect, is not part of the camera configuration as requested by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Correct:**\n    *   **\"static camera\"**: This is accurate. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way throughout the video.\n    *   **\"positioned at an overhead level, approximately at the height of a second floor\"**: This is an accurate and well-judged description. The camera is clearly elevated above the scene, consistent with an \"overhead level\" or \"high-level\" position.\n    *   **\"It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene\"**: This is correct. The foreground (near water), midground (birds on the water), and background (distant trees) are all in sharp focus.\n\n*   **Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"...with a level angle looking straight ahead.\"**: This is the most significant error. A **level angle** would mean the camera is parallel to the ground, looking straight across the river. In the video, the camera is clearly pointing **downward** at the scene. The correct term is a **high angle**.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most relevant points for this specific video: camera movement (static), height, angle, and focus.\n*   It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as these are all standard/absent, adhering to the instruction to be concise.\n*   Therefore, aside from the inaccuracy of the angle, the caption is reasonably complete according to the instructions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is mostly concise. However, the final clause, `\"...which includes a river landscape with trees and wildlife,\"` describes the *content* of the scene rather than the *camera's configuration*. The instructions specifically ask for a description of the configuration. While this information can be helpful context, it is technically outside the scope of the prompt.\n*   **Terminology:** The caption uses the correct terminology for \"static,\" \"overhead level,\" and \"deep focus.\" However, it fails by using \"level angle\" instead of the correct term, \"high angle.\"\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere are two improved versions that accurately describe the video according to the instructions.\n\n**Version 1 (Direct Correction):**\n\"The video features a static camera positioned at an overhead level with a **high angle** looking down on the scene. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire river landscape.\"\n\n**Version 2 (Slightly More Detailed & Polished):**\n\"This is a static, high-angle shot filmed from an overhead level. The camera uses deep focus, keeping all elements of the scene, from the near water to the distant trees, in sharp detail.\"\n\nBoth of these versions correct the critical error regarding the camera angle and are more tightly focused on the technical configuration as requested.",
