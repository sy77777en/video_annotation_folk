    "pre_caption": "The video features a level camera angle with deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field. The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption provides a reasonable but incomplete description, as it overlooks several key visual elements and incorrectly generalizes the characteristics of a single shot to the entire video. While the first shot is indeed static with a level angle and deep focus, the caption fails to mention that it is a fast-motion sequence, giving the scene a hurried, energetic feel, and that the wide lens introduces slight barrel distortion, curving the architecture at the frame's edges. More importantly, the caption completely omits the hard cut to a second, contrasting shot. This second segment features a high-angle, close-up view with an ultra-shallow depth of field, focusing only on a single subject in the midground while blurring everything else. Furthermore, this shot is not static; the camera performs a slow, deliberate counterclockwise arc to reveal more of the subject, a crucial movement that defines the shot's purpose. An improved caption would need to describe both distinct segments, noting the transition and detailing the contrasting camera configurations, including the change in video speed, focus, angle, and the introduction of camera movement in the second half.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a fast-motion sequence captured from a level camera angle, utilizing deep focus to maintain a large depth of field. The static shot, enhanced by a wide lens, introduces slight barrel distortion, subtly curving the architecture at the frame's edges and creating a hurried, energetic atmosphere. This scene abruptly transitions with a hard cut to a contrasting second shot. Here, the camera adopts a high-angle, close-up view with an ultra-shallow depth of field, isolating a single subject in the midground while blurring the surroundings. Unlike the first segment, this shot features a slow, deliberate counterclockwise arc, revealing more of the subject and adding dynamic movement that defines the shot's purpose. The caption captures both segments, highlighting the transition and detailing the contrasting camera configurations, including changes in video speed, focus, angle, and the introduction of camera movement in the second half.",
