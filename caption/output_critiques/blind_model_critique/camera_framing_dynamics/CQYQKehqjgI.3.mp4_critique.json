    "pre_caption": "From a static, high-angle viewpoint, the camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the background ingredients.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the background.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a perfect caption that masterfully follows the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy: Perfect**\nEvery piece of information in the caption is factually correct.\n*   **\"static\"**: The camera does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom. It is completely stationary.\n*   **\"high-angle viewpoint\"**: The camera is positioned above the subjects (the bowls of ingredients) and looks down, which is the definition of a high angle.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: The image has a very narrow plane of focus. The foreground bowls are heavily blurred, while the background bowls are sharp.\n*   **\"focusing on the background ingredients\"**: The focus plane is clearly on the bowls in the background, rendering them in sharp detail.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\nThe caption includes all the necessary and relevant information while correctly omitting what is not needed.\n*   **Included**: It correctly identifies the three most important and defining characteristics of the shot: its static nature, its high angle, and its specific use of shallow focus.\n*   **Omitted (Correctly)**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no discernible lens distortion, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Camera Height**: While \"overhead-level\" could have been added, \"high-angle\" sufficiently conveys the vertical position for a concise description.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\nThe caption demonstrates a complete understanding and application of the instructions.\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: The caption is a single, elegant sentence that packs all the critical information without any filler words. It perfectly balances detail with brevity.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions (\"static,\" \"high-angle,\" \"shallow depth of field\").\n*   **Focus Description**: It not only identifies the shallow depth of field but also specifies exactly where the focus plane is (\"on the background ingredients\"), which is a key part of the instruction.\n*   **Omission of Negatives**: It follows the rule \"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion... there is no need to mention these.\" This shows a high level of comprehension of the instructions' nuances.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, concise, and informative, capturing the essential visual grammar of the shot without unnecessary detail. It is a perfect description.",
