    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion video is captured from a static camera positioned at ground level, looking down at the scene from a high angle. The camera utilizes a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the monitor in the foreground. As the monitor is struck and debris moves into the midground, the focus shifts to follow these pieces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption attempts to follow the instructions but contains significant inaccuracies in its analysis of the camera angle and focus dynamics.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but fails on two key descriptive points.\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is correctly identified as **slow-motion**.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The camera is correctly identified as **static**.\n    *   **Camera Height:** The camera is correctly identified as being at **ground level**.\n    *   **Depth of Field:** The video does use a **shallow depth of field**.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption states the camera is \"looking down at the scene from a high angle.\" This is the opposite of what is shown. The camera is positioned very low and is **looking up** at the monitor, making it a **low angle** shot. A high angle would be positioned above the monitor, looking down on it.\n    *   **Focus Change:** The caption claims, \"the focus shifts to follow these pieces.\" This is inaccurate. The focus is **static** throughout the entire shot. The focal plane remains fixed on the midground where the monitor is located. The illusion of a focus change is created by the debris moving *through* the shallow depth of field—pieces become blurry as they fly toward the camera (into the foreground) or away from it (into the background). There is no active *rack focus* or *focus tracking*.\n    *   **Focus Plane:** The caption describes the monitor as being in the \"foreground.\" While close, it is more accurately the primary subject in the **midground**. The true foreground is the empty space between the lens and the monitor, which the debris flies into.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption covers most of the required elements from the instructions, either by mentioning them or by correctly omitting them (like lens distortion, which is not present).\n\n*   It addresses: video speed, camera movement (static), camera height, camera angle, and focus.\n*   It correctly omits: lens distortion, Dutch angle, and complex movements, as they are not present.\n\nWhile the caption attempts to be complete in scope, its inaccurate descriptions of angle and focus render it an incomplete and misleading analysis of the scene.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to the structural and terminological guidelines but fails in its application.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, as requested.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses appropriate terms like \"slow-motion,\" \"static,\" \"ground level,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\" However, it misapplies \"high angle\" and incorrectly implies a \"focus shift.\"\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly avoids mentioning the absence of lens distortion or regular video speed, which aligns with the instructions.\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a version of the caption that accurately reflects the video according to your instructions:\n\n**\"This slow-motion video is captured from a static, ground-level camera, which uses a low angle to look up at the monitor. The shot maintains a fixed focus with a shallow depth of field, keeping the monitor in the midground sharp. As the monitor shatters, the debris moves through the focal plane, appearing sharp in the midground but becoming blurry as it flies into the out-of-focus foreground and background.\"**",
