    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the camera's configuration.\n\n**Caption:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the foreground where a person's feet, covered in glitter, are prominently displayed. The shallow depth of field keeps the feet in sharp focus while the background remains blurred. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\"\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate.** The description of the focus and camera stability is excellent. However, the description of the camera's position is contradictory and therefore inaccurate.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The description of the focus (`shallow depth of field`, `feet in sharp focus`, `background remains blurred`) is precise and correct for this type of shot.\n    *   The description of the camera's movement (`fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement`) accurately captures the nature of a handheld shot where the operator is attempting to remain still.\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:**\n    *   The combination of **\"eye level\"** height and **\"level angle\"** is physically impossible for a shot focused on feet on the ground.\n        *   If the camera were at **eye-level**, it would have to be pointing down at the feet, making the camera angle a **high angle**.\n        *   If the camera had a **level angle** with the feet, its height would have to be **ground-level** or **low-level**.\n    *   This contradiction makes the core description of the camera's setup incorrect.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Mostly Complete.** The caption successfully covers most of the required elements from the instructions but fails on the key aspects of height and angle due to the inaccuracy.\n*   **Elements Covered Well:**\n    *   **Focus:** Depth of field, focus plane (foreground), and subject are all clearly described.\n    *   **Movement:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as stationary while noting its unsteadiness, fulfilling the instruction to describe steadiness.\n    *   **Subject/Framing:** It clearly states what is in focus and where it is in the frame.\n*   **Elements Missing or Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** While an attempt was made, the information provided is incorrect. A complete and accurate caption would have correctly identified the angle and height (e.g., \"high angle\" and \"hip-level,\" or \"level angle\" and \"ground-level\").\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Good Adherence, with One Major Flaw.** The caption follows the structural and stylistic guidelines well, but the factual error in describing the camera's position is a significant failure to meet the core requirement of providing an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n*   **Positive Adherence:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary words.\n    *   **Omission of Normals:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, assuming they are standard/absent, as per the instructions.\n*   **Negative Adherence:**\n    *   The primary goal is to accurately describe the configuration. By providing a contradictory and physically impossible setup, the caption fails in its main purpose.\n    *   A minor wording issue: \"Fixed but slightly unsteady\" is a slight oxymoron. \"Stationary but slightly unsteady\" or \"The shot is static, with minor unsteadiness from being handheld\" would be more precise.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: Is the caption good?\n\n**No, the caption is not good because of the critical inaccuracy in describing the camera's position.** While it excels in describing focus and stability, the contradictory statement about camera height and angle undermines its credibility and fails the primary instruction to provide an accurate configuration description.\n\n### Corrected Example Captions\n\nHere are two possible corrected versions, depending on the actual video:\n\n*   **Scenario 1 (Camera held by a standing person):**\n    > A static, handheld shot from a **high angle** and **hip-level** height focuses on a person's glitter-covered feet in the foreground. The shallow depth of field renders the background out of focus, and the camera exhibits slight unsteadiness.\n\n*   **Scenario 2 (Camera placed on the ground):**\n    > From a **ground-level** height and a **level angle**, this static shot captures a person's glitter-covered feet in the foreground. The camera is slightly unsteady, and a shallow depth of field blurs the background.",
