    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion video features a smooth camera movement that tilts down and pans right to track a mountain biker descending a steep, rocky slope. The camera begins at a low angle, looking up at the biker, and transitions to a level angle as it follows their movement. A deep focus keeps both the biker and the surrounding landscape sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting down and panning right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while panning and tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the slow-motion and the general camera movement, it mischaracterizes the focus and oversimplifies the camera work. The video actually employs a shallow depth of field, not a deep one, keeping the biker in sharp focus while beautifully blurring the distant mountain scenery, which effectively isolates the subject and adds a cinematic quality. Furthermore, describing the camera work as only a \"tilt down and pans right\" is incomplete; the camera not only pans and tilts but also trucks right for a short distance, moving parallel to the biker as they pass. This trucking motion creates a dynamic parallax effect between the biker and the background that the current caption misses. Lastly, the \"low angle\" could be more precisely described as ground-level, a choice that accentuates the ruggedness of the terrain, and the caption fails to mention the subtle barrel distortion present, indicating the use of a wide-angle lens to create a more immersive and dramatic perspective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This slow-motion video captures a mountain biker descending a steep, rocky slope with a cinematic touch. The camera starts at a ground-level angle, emphasizing the rugged terrain, and transitions to a level angle as it follows the biker's movement. Employing a shallow depth of field, the biker remains in sharp focus while the distant mountain scenery is beautifully blurred, isolating the subject. The camera work is dynamic, incorporating not only tilts and pans but also a trucking motion to the right, creating a parallax effect that enhances the scene's depth. Subtle barrel distortion from a wide-angle lens adds an immersive and dramatic perspective.",
