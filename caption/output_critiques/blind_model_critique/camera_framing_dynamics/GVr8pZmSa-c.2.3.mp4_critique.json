    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera cranes up around the letters before transitioning into a counterclockwise roll.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent, concise summary of the primary camera movements, but it is incomplete and slightly inaccurate according to the detailed instructions provided. It successfully identifies the main actions (crane, roll) but misses key details about the camera's configuration, focus, and the nuanced nature of the movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The phrase \"**cranes up around the letters**\" is a good, concise description of the initial movement, which involves both a vertical lift (crane) and a horizontal circular motion (arc).\n*   **Slightly Inaccurate:** The phrase \"**before transitioning into a counterclockwise roll**\" is not entirely accurate. The movement is not a distinct sequence where one action stops and another begins. Instead, the upward arc *blends seamlessly* into the roll. The roll begins while the upward and arcing motion is still concluding. A more accurate description would capture this fluid, continuous transformation of movement.\n*   **Accurate:** The identification of a \"**counterclockwise roll**\" is correct.\n*   **Accurate:** The statement \"**The movement is very smooth**\" is correct and important, as it indicates a controlled, non-handheld shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (Where the caption falls short)\n\nThe caption omits several key descriptive elements required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** It fails to mention the starting **low angle** and the change in camera height. The shot begins low, looking up at the letters, which is a significant stylistic choice.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the letters in the midground sharp while the background (sky and clouds) is softly blurred. This is a critical component of the video's visual style.\n*   **Movement Details:**\n    *   While \"cranes up around\" is good, explicitly mentioning the **counterclockwise arc** would be more precise.\n    *   The purpose of the movement—to reveal the letters in a dynamic and grand way—is not mentioned.\n*   **Other Omissions (Correctly Omitted):** The caption correctly omits video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle (until the roll creates one), as per the instruction to be concise when these are not present from the start.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption succeeds in being **concise**, but at the expense of being **informative**.\n*   It fails to provide a full description of the **camera's configuration** (angle, height, focus).\n*   It describes the movements but doesn't fully capture their **complexity** or the seamless blend between them, as the instructions suggest.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more fully adheres to your instructions, incorporating the missing details while remaining reasonably concise:\n\n**\"From a low angle, the camera smoothly cranes up and arcs counterclockwise around the letters, which are held in sharp focus against a blurry background (shallow depth of field). The motion then seamlessly blends into a continuous counterclockwise roll, creating a dynamic Dutch angle as the video ends.\"**\n\n#### Why this version is better:\n\n*   **Angle & Height:** It establishes the starting **low angle** and the **crane up** movement.\n*   **Focus:** It explicitly describes the **shallow depth of field** and identifies the **focus plane** (the letters).\n*   **Movement:** It uses more precise language (\"arcs counterclockwise\") and more accurately describes the movement's flow (\"seamlessly blends into\") rather than suggesting two separate actions.\n*   **Completeness:** It covers all the relevant, observable phenomena required by the instructions in a single, descriptive sentence.",
