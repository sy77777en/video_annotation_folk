    "pre_caption": "This point-of-view shot is filmed from hip level. The camera begins at a level angle and then smoothly tilts upward, transitioning to a low-angle view of the ceiling. The video appears to use deep focus, although the initial shot has a blurred effect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video seems to use deep focus, but the initial shot appears to have a blurred effect, possibly due to post-production.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the hip-level height and the upward tilt, it critically omits the primary forward movement that would be inherent in a point-of-view shot. For instance, the camera is likely dollying forward through a space like a museum gallery or corridor, and this continuous forward motion, along with its speed and steadiness, is a fundamental aspect of the shot that needs to be described. The description of the camera's stability is also missing; a hip-level POV shot would almost certainly have a slight, natural sway from the character's walking gait, which is an important textural detail. The explanation of focus is contradictory and imprecise. Stating the video \"appears to use deep focus, although the initial shot has a blurred effect\" is confusing. It would be more accurate to describe this as a dynamic change, such as, \"The shot begins out-of-focus and then pulls focus to establish a deep depth of field as the camera tilts upward,\" clarifying that the blur is an intentional, temporary state. Lastly, the caption could be improved by specifying the purpose of the tilt, which is likely to draw the viewer's attention to a specific subject, such as an ornate chandelier or a fresco on the ceiling, making the movement feel motivated rather than purely mechanical.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The point-of-view shot begins at hip level, with the camera dollying forward through a space like a museum gallery or corridor, maintaining a steady pace. This forward motion is accompanied by a slight, natural sway, reflecting the character's walking gait. Initially, the shot is out-of-focus, but it pulls focus to establish a deep depth of field as the camera smoothly tilts upward. This upward tilt transitions to a low-angle view of the ceiling, likely to draw attention to a specific subject, such as an ornate chandelier or a fresco, making the movement feel purposeful.",
