    "pre_caption": "This point-of-view shot is filmed from hip level. The camera begins at a level angle and then smoothly tilts upward, transitioning to a low-angle view of the ceiling. The video appears to use deep focus, although the initial shot has a blurred effect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video seems to use deep focus, but the initial shot appears to have a blurred effect, possibly due to post-production.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but has significant inaccuracies and omissions that prevent it from being a good description according to the provided instructions. It correctly identifies the point-of-view nature and the tilt but mischaracterizes the starting camera angle and, most importantly, fails to accurately describe the camera's movement and focus dynamics, which are key visual elements of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"This point-of-view shot...\"**: Correct. The perspective is clearly from a character's viewpoint.\n    *   **\"...is filmed from hip level.\"**: Correct. The height relative to the feet and the final view of the ceiling suggests a camera position on the torso, making \"hip level\" a very reasonable assessment.\n    *   **\"...smoothly tilts upward...\"**: Correct. The rotational upward movement is the most obvious camera action.\n    *   **\"...transitioning to a low-angle view of the ceiling.\"**: Correct. The final shot looks up at the ceiling, which is a low-angle view. A more precise term would be a **worm's-eye view**, but \"low-angle\" is not incorrect.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"The camera begins at a level angle...\"**: **This is incorrect.** The camera begins by looking steeply **downward** at the person's feet. This is a **high angle**, not a level angle.\n    *   **\"The video appears to use deep focus, although the initial shot has a blurred effect.\"**: **This is highly inaccurate and misleading.** The video does not use deep focus throughout. It begins with a very **shallow depth of field**, where the feet and floor are intentionally out of focus. The \"blurred effect\" is the result of this shallow focus. The most critical action is the **rack focus** (or focus pull) that occurs as the camera tilts up, shifting the plane of focus from the blurry foreground to the sharp background (the ceiling). The caption completely misidentifies this technique, describing it as a static state (\"deep focus\") with an anomaly (\"blurred effect\") rather than a dynamic action.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key descriptive elements required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Camera Movement (Translation):** The caption completely omits the camera's forward movement. The camera is **dollying forward** throughout the shot as the person walks into the room. This is a crucial part of the action.\n*   **Focus Dynamics:** It fails to describe the *dynamic change* in focus, which is a primary visual element. The instruction specifically asks to note **rack focus**, and this was the central focus technique used in the video.\n*   **Camera Angle (Specificity):** While \"low angle\" is acceptable, the final angle is a perfect example of a **worm's-eye view**, which is a more precise and descriptive term.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption succeeds in being concise and correctly omits mentions of normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and lack of a Dutch angle, as instructed.\n*   However, it fails to adhere to the core instruction to provide an \"informative description\" of the camera's configuration and movements. By missing the dolly movement and misinterpreting the rack focus, it fails to capture the shot's complexity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately and completely describes the video according to your instructions:\n\n**This point-of-view shot is filmed from hip level, dollying forward continuously. It begins at a high angle with a shallow depth of field, where the foreground is blurry. The camera then smoothly tilts upward while executing a rack focus to bring the ceiling into sharp view, ending in a worm's-eye perspective.**",
