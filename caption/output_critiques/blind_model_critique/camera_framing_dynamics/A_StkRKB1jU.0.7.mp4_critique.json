    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera remains stationary, showing three masked intruders entering a building. As they pass through the door, the camera begins panning left to track them.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning leftward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is highly accurate, mostly complete, and adheres very well to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **\"An eye-level...\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned at the approximate height of a standing person's eyes.\n*   **\"...handheld camera...\"**: Correct. While the pan is smooth, there is a subtle, organic quality to the movement that suggests it is operated by hand rather than mounted on a perfectly stable tripod.\n*   **\"...is initially stationary...\"**: Correct. The shot begins without any camera movement.\n*   **\"...with a shallow depth of field focused on the midground.\"**: Perfectly accurate. The door and the area immediately around it are in sharp focus (midground), while the desk in the foreground and the hallway in the deep background are softly blurred.\n*   **\"...the camera begins a smooth pan to the left to track them.\"**: Correct. The camera rotates horizontally to the left (a pan) with the clear purpose of following the subjects (tracking). The movement is steady and not shaky, justifying the word \"smooth.\"\n\n### Completeness: Very Good\nThe caption successfully covers the most important and observable elements required by the instructions. It also correctly omits details that are not present, as instructed.\n\n*   **Covered Elements**: Camera height, initial state (stationary), focus/depth of field, and camera movement (type, direction, steadiness, and purpose) are all included.\n*   **Correct Omissions**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so its omission is correct per the instructions.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so its omission is correct.\n*   **Minor Omission**:\n    *   **Camera Angle**: The instructions distinguish between camera *height* (eye-level) and camera *angle* (level angle). The caption includes \"eye-level\" but omits \"level angle.\" While \"eye-level\" often implies a level angle, explicitly stating it would make the description slightly more complete according to the strict definitions in the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions' intent, particularly regarding conciseness and terminology.\n\n*   **Conciseness**: The description is concise and informative, avoiding jargon where simpler terms suffice and combining multiple points into a fluid, readable sentence.\n*   **Terminology**: It correctly uses specific terms like \"pan,\" \"track,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"midground.\"\n*   **Structure**: It logically describes the initial static setup before detailing the movement that follows, which is easy to understand.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, clear, and efficient. The only potential improvement would be to add \"level angle\" for absolute completeness, but its absence does not detract from the overall high quality of the description.",
