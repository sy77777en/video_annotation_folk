    "pre_caption": "This video is filmed from an unsteady, high, eye-level angle with mild barrel distortion. The camera performs two rapid counterclockwise rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle. The focus is shallow, concentrating on the man in the foreground, and the quick movements produce noticeable motion blur.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows motion blur but likely uses shallow focus, primarily focusing on the foreground subject.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera performs two rapid counterclockwise rolls, one after the other.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies key elements like the shallow focus and barrel distortion, it contains several points of confusion and omission. The description of the camera angle as both \"high\" and \"eye-level\" is contradictory; it should clarify whether it's a high-angle shot looking down or an eye-level shot of a subject in a high location (e.g., \"an eye-level shot of a man on a rooftop\"). The mention of a \"varying Dutch angle\" is redundant, as this is an inherent result of a camera roll. The description of movement is incomplete; while the two rolls are noted, the video likely includes other simultaneous movements, such as a slight tilt down or a subtle track left to keep the man centered during his action. Furthermore, the caption fails to specify the video's playback speed—a critical detail. For instance, the man's action could be in slow-motion while the camera rolls occur at regular speed, creating a dynamic speed ramp effect. Finally, describing \"motion blur\" is less important than detailing the purpose of the camera's complex movement, which seems designed to create a disorienting, stylistic effect that complements the subject's dynamic action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an eye-level shot of a man on a rooftop, filmed with an unsteady camera that includes mild barrel distortion. The camera performs two rapid counterclockwise rolls, accompanied by a slight tilt down and a subtle track left to keep the man centered. The shallow focus highlights the man in the foreground, while the video features a dynamic speed ramp effect, with the man's action in slow-motion and the camera rolls at regular speed. This complex movement creates a disorienting, stylistic effect that complements the subject's dynamic action.",
