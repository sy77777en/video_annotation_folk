    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is good but has one key inaccuracy. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is well-written, concise, and mostly accurate. It correctly identifies several key technical aspects of the shot. However, it makes a significant error in describing the camera height, which misrepresents the shot's setup.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **\"static camera\"**: Correct. The camera does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom.\n    *   **\"low-angle view\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned below the subject's head and is angled upward, which defines a low-angle shot.\n    *   **\"The focus is deep, maintaining clarity across the entire scene\"**: Correct. The man's face (midground), the floor (foreground), and the wall/door in the background are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"emphasizing the unusual perspective\"**: This is an accurate interpretation of the *purpose* of the low angle, which adds valuable context.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"positioned at hip level\"**: This is incorrect. The camera is placed at or very near **ground level** (or floor level). A hip-level camera would be positioned much higher, resulting in a level or slightly high angle on the subject's head, completely changing the shot's dynamic. The current ground-level placement is what creates the distinct low angle.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most relevant points required by the instructions for this specific video: camera movement (static), angle, and focus.\n*   It correctly adheres to the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present, such as:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** There is only one continuous shot.\n\nThe caption is therefore sufficiently complete according to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption uses the correct terminology (static, low-angle, deep focus).\n*   It is concise, as requested.\n*   It successfully describes the camera's configuration and focus.\n\nThe only failure in adherence is the factual error regarding camera height.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracy while maintaining the strengths of the original:\n\n**\"The video is captured from a static, ground-level camera using a low angle. The focus is deep, keeping the entire scene from the foreground floor to the background wall in sharp focus, which emphasizes the subject's unusual position.\"**\n\n**Why this is better:**\n\n*   **Corrects the Height:** It accurately identifies the camera height as \"ground-level.\"\n*   **Maintains Conciseness:** It remains short and to the point.\n*   **Improves Specificity:** It slightly enhances the description of the deep focus by mentioning the foreground and background elements that are sharp.",
