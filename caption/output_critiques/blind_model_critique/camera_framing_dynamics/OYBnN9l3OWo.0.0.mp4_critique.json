    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both the woman in the foreground and the background elements sharp. The camera moves forward toward the woman, with slightly unsteady movement and some shaking, as it approaches her while she holds up a camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot. However, there is one significant inaccuracy and a few areas where it could be more complete and precise according to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on Your Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** You are correct that the camera is at **eye level** with a **level angle**.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** Your description of the camera moving forward with \"slightly unsteady movement and some shaking\" is very accurate. It perfectly captures the handheld, walking motion.\n    *   **Subject:** You correctly identify the subject and her action (a woman holding up a camera).\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is the main point of inaccuracy. The caption states the camera uses **\"deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both the woman... and the background elements sharp.\"** This is incorrect. The video actually uses a **shallow depth of field**. The woman is in focus, but the background (the buildings, trees, and other people) is noticeably blurred. The purpose of this technique is to isolate the subject from her environment, drawing the viewer's attention directly to her.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is concise, which is good, but it omits a few details from the instructions that would add valuable information:\n    *   **Focus Plane:** You mention the woman is in the foreground, but she starts in the midground and the camera moves toward her. The focus plane is the **midground**, and it is maintained on her as she moves into the foreground.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** While implied, explicitly stating the purpose—\"to approach the subject\"—would strengthen the description.\n    *   **Type of Movement:** You describe the movement well, but using the technical term \"dolly forward\" or specifying it's a \"handheld walking motion\" would be slightly more precise.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:** You successfully followed the instruction to be concise and to omit irrelevant details like video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angles, as none were present. You covered height, angle, and movement as requested.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The primary deviation from the instructions is the inaccurate assessment of the depth of field. The instructions place significant emphasis on correctly identifying focus (deep vs. shallow, focus plane, focus changes), and this was the one area where the caption was mistaken.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but not great due to the critical error in describing the depth of field. It successfully captures the perspective and movement but misinterprets the focus, which is a key stylistic choice in the video.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\n\"From an eye-level, level angle, the camera dollies forward with a natural, handheld shakiness, simulating a person walking. The shot utilizes a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the woman in the midground sharp while the background remains blurred. Focus is maintained on the woman as the camera steadily approaches her.\"",
