    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The player hides behind a building while preparing to shoot, then moves slightly left and zooms in to aim and zooms out as they stop aiming.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is **very good**. It is accurate, concise, and successfully captures the most important technical and narrative aspects of the video while adhering to the core principles of the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy: Excellent\n*   **\"From an unsteady, eye-level perspective...\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera movement has a slight handheld shake, making it \"unsteady,\" and the height is clearly intended to mimic a person's \"eye-level\" view.\n*   **\"...the camera peeks from behind a building.\"**: This is an accurate and descriptive way to characterize the initial action of emerging from cover.\n*   **\"It moves quickly to the left...\"**: The direction and speed of the movement are correctly identified.\n*   **\"...then zooms in to aim before zooming back out.\"**: This correctly describes the sequence of the zoom, its purpose (indicated by the crosshairs appearing), and the subsequent zoom out.\n*   **\"The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus.\"**: This is a precise description of the depth of field. In the video, both the nearby wall and the distant buildings are perfectly in focus, which is a hallmark of deep focus (common in video game engines).\n\n#### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions: Very Good\n\nThe caption does an excellent job of including the necessary information and omitting the unnecessary, as instructed.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption avoids unnecessary jargon and gets straight to the point, fulfilling the \"concise yet informative\" requirement.\n    *   **Video Speed & Lens Distortion:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed or lens distortion, as the video is in real-time and has no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Camera Height & Steadiness:** It correctly identifies the \"eye-level\" height and \"unsteady\" nature of the camera.\n    *   **Movement Sequence & Purpose:** It clearly outlines the sequence of events (peek, move left, zoom in, zoom out) and correctly identifies the purpose of the zoom (\"to aim\").\n    *   **Focus:** It accurately identifies the \"deep focus.\"\n\n*   **Minor Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Technical Terminology for Movement:** The instruction encourages the use of specific terms like \"trucking\" (moving left/right). While \"moves... to the left\" is accurate, \"trucks quickly to the left\" would be a more technically precise description of the camera's translational movement.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption mentions \"eye-level perspective\" but doesn't explicitly state the \"level angle.\" While often implied by an eye-level shot, adding this detail would make the description slightly more complete according to the prompt.\n\n### Revised Caption for Comparison\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the minor suggestions to be even more technically aligned with the instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption:** *From an unsteady, eye-level, and level-angle perspective, the camera peeks from behind a building. It **trucks quickly to the left**, then zooms in to aim before zooming back out. The entire scene is kept in sharp detail with a deep focus.*\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe original caption is excellent and highly effective. It fulfills 95% of the detailed instructions perfectly. The feedback provided is only for minor refinement to achieve full technical compliance with the prompt's suggested terminology. For almost any practical purpose, the original caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions.",
