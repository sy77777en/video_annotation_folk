    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, employing a shallow depth of field focused on the midground. The camera smoothly moves upward before tilting downward, capturing a scene of two men talking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures the scene of two men talking, initially moving upward and then tilting downward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good, concise summary of the video's key visual elements. However, it lacks the technical precision and completeness required by the detailed instructions, particularly concerning camera movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"camera at eye level with a level angle\"**: Correct. The shot begins at the eye level of the subjects with a standard, level horizon.\n    *   **\"employing a shallow depth of field focused on the midground\"**: Perfectly accurate. The background (cityscape through the window) is clearly blurred, while the two men in the midground are sharp.\n    *   **\"smoothly\"**: Correct. The camera movement is very smooth and controlled, with no shaking.\n    *   **\"tilting downward\"**: Correct. After the initial upward movement, the camera does tilt down to keep the subjects in the frame.\n    *   **\"capturing a scene of two men talking\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the content.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Imprecise:**\n    *   **\"moves upward\"**: This is the main point of imprecision. The term is too general. The instructions ask for specific movement types like *panning, tilting, pedestaling, or craning*. In this video, the entire camera assembly moves vertically up while remaining parallel to the ground. This is a **pedestal up** movement, not a tilt up. The caption fails to make this crucial distinction.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Specific Movement Terminology**: As mentioned above, the caption omits the correct technical term **\"pedestal up\"**.\n    *   **Steadiness**: While \"smoothly\" implies steadiness, the instructions ask to describe steadiness explicitly. Mentioning the shot is **\"steady\"** or on a stable platform would add completeness.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement**: The instructions mention describing the purpose of the movement if relevant. Here, the movement serves to **re-frame the subjects** from a slightly higher vantage point, which could have been noted.\n\n*   **What's Correctly Omitted (Adherence to Conciseness):**\n    *   The caption correctly avoids mentioning **video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles**, as none are present. This follows the instruction to be concise and not mention absent features.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the general spirit of the instructions but falls short on the specific details required.\n\n*   It successfully identifies camera height, angle, and focus as requested.\n*   It fails to use the specific vocabulary for camera movement (**pedestal**) that was explicitly listed in the instructions. The instruction states: \"Specify movements such as *tracking... pedestaling (moving up/down)...*\" The caption's use of the generic \"moves upward\" does not meet this requirement.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"An eye-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field focused on the midground. The camera performs a smooth and steady pedestal up, followed by a slight tilt down to re-frame the two men talking.\"**\n\n### Why the Improved Caption is Better:\n\n*   **Uses Precise Terminology**: It replaces the vague \"moves upward\" with the correct technical term **\"pedestal up\"**.\n*   **Adds Detail on Steadiness**: It explicitly mentions the movement is **\"steady\"**, fulfilling that part of the instruction.\n*   **Maintains Conciseness**: It incorporates the necessary details without becoming overly long or verbose.\n*   **Clear Sequence**: It clearly describes the sequence of movements: first the pedestal, then the tilt.",
