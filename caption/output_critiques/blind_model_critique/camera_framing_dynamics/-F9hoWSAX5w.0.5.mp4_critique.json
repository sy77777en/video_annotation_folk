    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It accurately identifies the most prominent features of the shot (angle, focus, and basic movement) and is commendably concise. However, it misses several key details required by the comprehensive instructions, such as camera height, movement speed, and the specific technical names for the movements.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**. Everything it states is correct:\n*   **\"low-angle view\"**: Correct. The camera is pointed significantly upward at the buildings.\n*   **\"deep focus, capturing a large depth of field\"**: Correct. The ground in the immediate foreground, the person in the midground, and the buildings in the background are all in sharp focus.\n*   **\"camera moves forward while tilting up\"**: Correct. These are the two primary camera movements.\n*   **\"maintaining smooth and steady motion\"**: Correct. The movement is fluid, suggesting the use of a gimbal, dolly, or digital stabilization.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **incomplete** when measured against the detailed instructions. It omits the following required information:\n\n*   **Camera Height**: The caption mentions the angle (`low-angle`) but not the height. The shot is clearly filmed from **ground-level**, which is a crucial detail for describing the setup.\n*   **Movement Specificity & Speed**: While \"moves forward\" and \"tilting up\" are correct, the instructions encourage more specific terminology like **\"dollies forward\"** and **\"tilts up\"**. The **speed** of the movement, which is slow and deliberate, is also not mentioned.\n*   **Purpose of Movement**: The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement if relevant. Here, the combined dolly and tilt is a classic technique used to **reveal the scale and grandeur of the tall buildings**, creating a sense of awe. This purpose is a key part of the shot's design and is missing from the caption.\n*   **Focus Plane**: While \"deep focus\" is correct, the instructions also mention describing the focus plane. In this case, it's a **static deep focus** where the focus plane effectively covers the foreground, midground, and background simultaneously, with no changes.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to some instructions but falls short on others.\n\n*   **Adheres Well**:\n    *   **Conciseness**: The caption is very concise.\n    *   **Omitting Negatives**: It correctly avoids mentioning the absence of lens distortion, speed changes, or a Dutch angle, as per the instructions.\n\n*   **Needs Improvement**:\n    *   **Informativeness**: It fails to provide a complete description of the camera's configuration and movement by omitting height, speed, and purpose. It sacrifices too much information for the sake of conciseness.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more fully adheres to the instructions while remaining concise:\n\n**\"This single, continuous shot is filmed from a ground-level, low-angle perspective. The camera slowly and smoothly dollies forward while simultaneously tilting up to reveal the scale of the surrounding skyscrapers. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the foreground to the background, consistently sharp.\"**",
