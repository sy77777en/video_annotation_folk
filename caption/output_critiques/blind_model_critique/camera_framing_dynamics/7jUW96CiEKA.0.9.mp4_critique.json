    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning right to left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **mostly good but contains a key inaccuracy** regarding the camera's movement. It successfully follows most of the instructions for conciseness and content but fails on one critical detail.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"The camera is positioned above water... with a level angle\" is perfectly accurate.\n    *   **Focus:** \"It uses deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene\" is correct. The egret in the midground and the distant shoreline in the background are both sharp.\n    *   **Subject & Movement Quality:** The description of the subject as \"the egret near the water's edge\" and the movement as \"slow,\" \"smooth,\" and \"steady\" are all accurate.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Movement Direction:** The caption states the camera \"pans slowly from right to left.\" This is incorrect. The camera is actually panning from **left to right**. You can tell because the content of the frame moves from right to left, which is the result of the camera lens turning towards the right.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\n*   The caption correctly identifies and describes all the necessary elements present in the video: camera height, angle, focus, and movement (type, speed, and steadiness).\n*   It correctly adheres to the instruction for conciseness by omitting details for aspects that are standard or absent, such as:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction: Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully provides a \"concise yet informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n*   It uses the correct terminology as requested (e.g., \"pans,\" \"deep focus,\" \"level angle\").\n*   The primary failure in adherence is the factual error in the pan direction, which compromises the overall quality of the description.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example:\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the error and slightly improves the phrasing for better flow:\n\n\"Positioned above water with a level angle, the camera uses deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. It performs a slow and steady pan from **left to right**, following an egret standing at the water's edge.\"",
