    "pre_caption": "This stop-motion video is captured from a static, ground-level camera with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the midground where the shoes and suitcase are located.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery statement in the caption is a precise and correct description of the video:\n*   **\"This stop-motion video...\"**: Correct. The jerky, frame-by-frame movement of the shoes and suitcase is characteristic of stop-motion animation.\n*   **\"...is captured from a static...\"**: Correct. The camera's position and framing do not change at all throughout the video.\n*   **\"...ground-level camera with a level angle.\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned very low to the floor, looking straight ahead at the subjects, not tilting up or down.\n*   **\"It employs a shallow depth of field...\"**: Correct. The floorboards in the immediate foreground and the background are noticeably out of focus, while the subjects are sharp.\n*   **\"...with the focus set on the midground where the shoes and suitcase are located.\"**: Correct. The plane of sharp focus is clearly on the shoes and suitcase, which occupy the midground of the frame.\n\n### 2. Completeness and Conciseness\nThe caption successfully adheres to the instruction to be \"concise yet informative\":\n*   It correctly identifies all the key, non-standard features of the shot: **stop-motion speed**, **static movement**, **ground-level height**, **level angle**, and **shallow depth of field with a midground focus**.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, as instructed. There is no lens distortion, no Dutch angle, no camera movement, and no focus changes, so these are not mentioned, which keeps the caption concise.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all specific guidelines:\n*   **Video Speed:** It correctly uses the term \"stop-motion\" as requested for this type of altered speed.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It clearly describes the camera's height (\"ground-level\"), angle (\"level angle\"), and lack of movement (\"static\").\n*   **Focus:** It accurately describes both the depth of field (\"shallow\") and the focus plane (\"midground\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the technical and descriptive requirements, resulting in a description that is both technically precise and easy to understand.",
