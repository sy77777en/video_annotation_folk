    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at an aerial level with a high angle, looking down over the rice fields. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements from the foreground to the background sharp. The drone moves smoothly forward above the fields while steadily panning left to adjust its orientation, providing a comprehensive view of the landscape. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone steadily pans left to adjust its orientation while moving forward in the direction it faces.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good and largely accurate, but it can be improved in terms of completeness and conciseness.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **What's Correct:** The caption is accurate in identifying the key configurations:\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** `aerial level` and `high angle` are both correct.\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus` is an accurate description, as everything from the foreground terraces to the background hills is sharp.\n    *   **Movement:** The description of the camera moving `smoothly forward` while `steadily panning left` correctly identifies the two primary, simultaneous movements.\n\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The phrase \"to adjust its orientation\" is a slight mischaracterization. The pan isn't just a minor adjustment; it's a continuous and deliberate cinematic movement that works with the forward dolly to create a sweeping reveal of the landscape.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **What's Missing:** The caption fails to mention the **slight barrel distortion** visible from the drone's wide-angle lens. This is noticeable in how the straight lines of the rice paddy edges curve slightly outwards as they approach the sides of the frame. The instructions specifically ask to describe lens distortion if it is present.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions (Conciseness):**\n*   **What's Good:** The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details about the normal video speed and the absence of a Dutch angle.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The final sentence, \"The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking,\" is redundant. The preceding sentence already states the drone \"moves smoothly.\" The quality of the movement (steadiness) can be integrated more efficiently into the main description of the movement itself.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption:\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to all instructions:\n\n\"From an aerial, high-angle perspective, the camera captures the rice fields with deep focus. The shot exhibits slight barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens. The camera smoothly dollies forward while simultaneously panning left, creating a steady, sweeping view of the landscape.\"",
