    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera initially zooms out slowly, then quickly moves downward and zooms out to shift focus from the captain to the airplane on the leaflet.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent, high-level summary of the action but is **not good** when measured against the specific and technical requirements of the instructions. It contains a significant factual inaccuracy regarding the camera movement and omits several key details that were explicitly requested.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The caption's most significant error is identifying the camera movement as a **\"zoom out.\"**\n    *   **What actually happens:** The camera is physically moving backward, away from the subject. This is a **dolly out**. A zoom involves changing the lens's focal length, which creates a different visual effect (the perspective and spatial relationship between the subject and background would not change in the same way). In the video, you can see the perspective shift, confirming it is a dolly movement.\n    *   **Why it matters:** The instructions specifically differentiate between \"zooming\" and \"dollying,\" making this a critical distinction.\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   The description of the movement as \"slow\" at the beginning and \"quick\" in the second half is correct.\n    *   The description of the camera moving \"downward\" is correct, although less precise than \"pedestaling down\" or \"tilting down.\"\n    *   The statement that the movement is \"smooth with minimal shaking\" is accurate. The shot is very steady.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is highly incomplete and misses several key descriptive elements required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Focus and Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field** to isolate the subject. More importantly, it performs a **rack focus** (or focus pull), shifting the plane of sharp focus from the captain's face (midground) to the leaflet (foreground). The caption mentions \"shift focus\" but uses it in a general sense of shifting the audience's attention, not in the technical sense of changing the lens's focus plane, which was a specific requirement.\n*   **Missing - Camera Angle and Height:** The caption does not describe the camera angle or height.\n    *   The shot begins at **eye-level** with a **slightly low angle** on the captain.\n    *   It transitions to a **high angle** as it looks down upon the leaflet.\n*   **Missing - Precise Movement Description:** While it mentions moving \"downward,\" it fails to describe the full complexity of the movement. The camera is simultaneously **dollying backward, pedestaling down, and tilting down** to keep the leaflet centered. The instructions ask for this level of detail.\n*   **Missing - Lens Distortion & Video Speed:** The caption correctly omits these as they are not present (regular speed, no distortion). This adheres to the conciseness rule in the instructions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the core requirements of the instructions.\n\n*   It did not provide an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n*   It failed to correctly identify the type of camera movement, using \"zoom\" instead of \"dolly.\"\n*   It completely ignored the instruction to describe \"focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).\"\n*   It failed to describe the \"camera angle\" and \"camera height.\"\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately follows all the given instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a slightly low, eye-level angle with a shallow depth of field, the camera begins with a slow dolly out, keeping the captain's face in focus. The movement then accelerates as the camera simultaneously pedestals and tilts down, continuing to dolly out. During this movement, a rack focus smoothly shifts the focus plane from the captain to the airplane on the leaflet in the foreground. The entire shot is smooth and steady.\"**",
