    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from an eye-level, first-person perspective typical of an FPS game, with the camera at a level angle looking straight ahead. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp. The camera moves forward throughout the video, initially trucking slightly to the right, and midway gently panning left to adjust its facing. Movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, reflecting the handheld or in-game viewpoint. The camera’s focus remains on the player's path and immediate environment as they navigate through interior spaces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the perspective of a FPS game. It moves forward throughout the video and slightly trucks right at first. Midway, it also gently pans left to adjust the facing.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and closely follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent.** The description is highly accurate.\n    *   **Perspective, Height, and Angle:** Correctly identifies the shot as an `eye-level`, `first-person perspective` with a `level angle`, which is spot-on for this type of in-game footage.\n    *   **Focus:** The term `deep focus` is the perfect way to describe a typical video game rendering where the entire scene is sharp, lacking a physical camera's depth of field.\n    *   **Movement:** The breakdown of movement is precise. It correctly identifies the primary forward motion, the initial `trucking` to the right, and the subsequent `panning` to the left. Describing the movement as `slightly unsteady` with `shaking` is an accurate way to characterize the common \"head-bob\" effect in first-person games.\n    *   **Purpose:** The final sentence correctly identifies the purpose of the camera's attention—following the player's path.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent.** The caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested by the instructions while correctly omitting what isn't present.\n    *   **Included:** It covers camera height, angle, movement types (translation and rotation), steadiness, purpose, and focus depth.\n    *   **Omitted (Correctly):** It adheres to the instruction to be concise by not mentioning:\n        *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed.\n        *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no significant distortion.\n        *   **Dutch Angle:** The camera is not tilted.\n        *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot.\n        *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent.** The caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the detailed instructions.\n    *   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into a few clear sentences without being verbose.\n    *   **Technical Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms like `trucking`, `panning`, and `deep focus`.\n    *   **Contextualization:** The phrase \"typical of an FPS game\" is a brilliant and concise way to provide context for all the technical choices (the POV, the head-bob, the deep focus).\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Improvement\n\nThe caption is already very strong, but for absolute perfection according to the most technical interpretation of the rules, one minor tweak could be made:\n\n*   The final sentence, \"The camera’s focus remains on the player's path and immediate environment as they navigate through interior spaces,\" describes the *narrative* focus or the *subject* of the shot. The instructions primarily ask for *optical* focus (depth of field, focus plane). Since the movement description already makes the camera's path clear, this sentence is slightly redundant.\n\n**Revised Caption for Maximum Technical Conciseness:**\n\n> The video is presented from an eye-level, first-person perspective typical of an FPS game, with the camera at a level angle. It maintains deep focus, keeping all elements sharp. The camera dollies forward throughout, initially trucking slightly right before panning left to adjust its facing. The movement is slightly unsteady, reflecting the in-game viewpoint.\n\nThis revised version replaces \"moves forward\" with the more technical term `dollies forward` and removes the final sentence to be even more concise and strictly focused on the requested technical parameters.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe original caption is excellent and fulfills the prompt's requirements to a high degree. It is accurate, complete, and follows the instructions for conciseness and terminology. The suggested revision is a minor refinement to achieve ultimate technical precision, but the provided caption is already a model example of what was asked for.",
