    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, capturing a street view with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera moves forward along the sidewalk while gradually panning right to adjust its orientation, resulting in a slightly unsteady image with some shaking. The camera work centers on the street scene, including passing vehicles and pedestrians.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows the street view, moving forward while gradually panning right to adjust its orientation.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great request for a detailed analysis. Here is a breakdown of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good and largely successful in its goal. It is accurate, mostly complete, and follows the spirit of the instructions by being concise. However, it misses one specific detail mentioned in the instructions and could be slightly more precise with its terminology.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe information presented in the caption is highly accurate.\n\n*   **Camera Position & Angle:** **\"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle\"** is correct. The perspective matches that of a person of average height walking, and the horizon is kept mostly level.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** **\"...capturing a street view with deep focus and a large depth of field\"** is correct. Nearly everything in the frame, from the foreground sidewalk to the background buildings, remains in sharp focus. This is typical of a camera (like a smartphone) with a small aperture shooting in bright daylight.\n*   **Camera Movement:** **\"The camera moves forward along the sidewalk while gradually panning right to adjust its orientation\"** is an accurate description of the primary movements. The forward motion is clear, and the slow rightward pan follows the curve of the path.\n*   **Steadiness:** **\"...resulting in a slightly unsteady image with some shaking\"** is also accurate. The movement is clearly handheld, with the natural bob and sway of a person walking. The term \"slightly unsteady\" correctly captures that it isn't excessively shaky.\n*   **Purpose:** **\"The camera work centers on the street scene, including passing vehicles and pedestrians\"** accurately describes the purpose of the shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses one key element requested by the instructions.\n\n*   **What's Missing:** The caption fails to mention **lens distortion**.\n*   **Analysis:** The video exhibits slight but noticeable **barrel distortion**. This is visible in the way that vertical lines, such as the edges of buildings and street poles, appear to curve slightly outwards near the left and right edges of the frame. The instructions explicitly state, \"If lens distortion is present, describe the type and degree.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions, particularly regarding conciseness and omission.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon while still being informative.\n    *   **Omission:** It correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (as it's regular), **Dutch angle** (as there is none), and **shot transitions** (as it's a single shot), just as the instructions advise.\n    *   **Movement Description:** It successfully describes the type, direction, steadiness, and purpose of the camera movement.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** As noted in the \"Completeness\" section, the failure to mention the visible barrel distortion is the main deviation from the instructions.\n    *   **Technical Terminology:** While \"moves forward\" is perfectly clear, using the more technical term **\"dollying forward\"** from the instructions would demonstrate a more precise adherence. Similarly, the \"shaking\" is a result of a **handheld** shot, which could be stated explicitly.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to all instructions:\n\n**\"Positioned at eye-level with a level angle, the camera captures a street view with deep focus, exhibiting slight barrel distortion. The camera dollies forward in a handheld, slightly unsteady motion, while gradually panning right to follow the sidewalk and keep the street scene centered.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n1.  **Includes Lens Distortion:** It adds the missing detail of \"slight barrel distortion.\"\n2.  **Uses Technical Terms:** It uses \"dollies forward\" as suggested by the instructions.\n3.  **More Precise:** It specifies the motion is \"handheld,\" which is the direct cause of the unsteadiness.\n4.  **Maintains Conciseness:** It remains compact and easy to read while containing more technical detail.",
