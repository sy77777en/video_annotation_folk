    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially accurate but contains significant errors** regarding the camera's position and angle. While it correctly identifies some aspects, it fails to accurately describe the overall camera configuration.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Correct:**\n    *   **\"static camera\"**: This is accurate. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way throughout the video.\n    *   **\"capturing a padel match\"**: This correctly identifies the video's content.\n    *   **\"employs deep focus, ensuring all elements on the court are sharp and clear\"**: This is an excellent and accurate description. The entire court, from the players closest to the camera to the back wall, is in sharp focus.\n\n*   **Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"positioned at eye level\"**: This is incorrect. The camera is positioned high above the court, looking down on the players. The correct description would be **overhead-level** or **high-mounted**.\n    *   **\"The camera angle is level, looking straight ahead\"**: This is also incorrect. Because the camera is positioned high and pointing downwards, it is a **high angle**, not a level one. A level angle would be parallel to the ground, which is not the case here.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption successfully adheres to the instruction for conciseness by omitting details about normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n*   It attempts to cover the required elements (movement, height, angle, focus), but the inaccuracies in height and angle make it an incomplete and misleading description of the camera's setup.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption fails because it misidentifies two of the most fundamental aspects of the shot: its height and angle. An eye-level, level-angle shot would create a completely different viewing experience, placing the viewer on the court with the players. This shot, by contrast, provides a strategic, all-encompassing overview from above.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example:\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately follows the instructions:\n\n\"The video is captured from a **static, overhead-level camera**. It uses a **high angle** to look down on the padel match, maintaining **deep focus** to keep the entire court and all players sharp and clear.\"",
