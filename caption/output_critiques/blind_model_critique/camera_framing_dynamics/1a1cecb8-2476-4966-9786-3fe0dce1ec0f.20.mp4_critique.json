    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle while incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera pans right with unsteady movement, exhibiting noticeable shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good start and correctly identifies several key visual characteristics. However, it is inaccurate and incomplete in its description of the camera's movement, which is the most dominant feature of the video. It oversimplifies the motion to the point of being misleading.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** \"noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward\" - **Correct.** The video clearly exhibits strong fisheye distortion.\n    *   **Camera Angle & Roll:** \"maintains a level angle while incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling\" - **Correct.** The camera generally points forward (level angle) but rolls continuously, creating a disorienting, shifting Dutch angle.\n    *   **Focus:** \"employs deep focus with a large depth of field\" - **Correct.** Everything from the foreground pipes to the background structures is in sharp focus.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"unsteady movement, exhibiting noticeable shaking\" - **Correct.** There is a high-frequency jitter and general unsteadiness typical of FPV drone footage without advanced stabilization.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong or is misleading:**\n    *   **Camera Movement:** \"The camera pans right\" - **Highly Inaccurate.** The primary movement is a **fast dolly forward** through the environment. While the camera does pan slightly to navigate, describing the entire motion as a \"pan right\" completely misrepresents the action. The camera is moving *through* the space, not just rotating from a fixed point.\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"positioned at eye level\" - **Inaccurate.** The camera is not static. It starts at a height that could be considered eye-level relative to the structures, but it moves up and down (pedestals/cranes) as it navigates. Describing it as \"positioned\" implies a static height.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\nThe caption is missing several critical details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Primary Movement (Translation):** It completely omits the **fast forward dolly** movement, which is the video's defining characteristic.\n*   **Movement Speed:** The instruction asks to describe speed. The camera is moving very **fast**, which is a crucial part of the shot's dynamic feel. This is not mentioned.\n*   **Movement Complexity & Purpose:** The instruction asks to describe complexity and purpose. The caption fails to mention that the camera is performing multiple movements simultaneously (dollying, panning, tilting, rolling) for the clear **purpose of navigating a complex environment**.\n*   **Height Changes:** It fails to note that the camera's height changes throughout the shot.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instruction**\n\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise and to omit unnecessary information (like regular video speed and lack of transitions).\n*   However, it fails to provide an \"informative description of the... movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose).\" By misidentifying the primary movement and omitting its speed and complexity, it does not fulfill the core requirement of the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely describes the video according to your instructions:\n\n**The video is shot with a fisheye lens, creating significant distortion. It maintains deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. From a roughly eye-level perspective with a level angle, the camera moves quickly forward in a complex path, simultaneously panning, tilting, and rolling to navigate the industrial environment. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, and the constant rolling creates a varying Dutch angle.**",
