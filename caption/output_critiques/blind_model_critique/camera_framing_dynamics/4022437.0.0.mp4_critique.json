    "pre_caption": "From a ground-level, level angle, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly moves backward away from a black Mercedes-Benz S550, which is parked with its doors open. Midway through the backward movement, the camera performs a slight pan to the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward continuously, with a slight pan to the left midway through.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good and captures several key aspects of the shot correctly. However, it contains a significant technical inaccuracy regarding the camera movement and could be slightly more precise in its description.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n#### **Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** `From a ground-level, level angle` is a good description. The camera is very low to the ground and the horizon is level.\n    *   **Focus:** `the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp` is perfectly accurate. Both the car in the foreground and the background details are in clear focus throughout the shot.\n    *   **Subject & Action:** `a black Mercedes-Benz S550, which is parked with its doors open` is a correct identification of the subject.\n    *   **Movement Direction & Steadiness:** `The camera smoothly moves backward` correctly identifies the primary movement (a dolly out) and its steady quality.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Movement Type:** The phrase `performs a slight pan to the left` is incorrect.\n        *   A **pan** is a rotational movement where the camera pivots horizontally on a fixed axis (like turning your head).\n        *   In the video, the entire camera rig moves sideways to the left. This is a translational movement known as a **truck** or **trucking left**. The camera's lens remains pointed in roughly the same direction relative to its body; the entire apparatus is what moves.\n\n#### **Completeness: Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the required elements: camera height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   It correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, as none of these are present or altered.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instruction: Good, with one key exception**\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the overall goal of providing a concise, informative description.\n*   It fails on the specific instruction to accurately describe the type of camera movement, using the term \"pan\" incorrectly instead of \"truck.\" The instructions explicitly list \"trucking\" as a type of movement to identify.\n*   The description of the movement as two separate events (`moves backward... Midway... performs a slight pan`) is also slightly misleading. The backward (dolly) and sideways (truck) movements occur simultaneously, creating a single, smooth diagonal path away from the car.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is a strong attempt and is mostly correct, but the inaccurate use of the term \"pan\" is a significant flaw based on the detailed technical requirements of the instructions. A more precise caption would correctly identify the sideways movement as a \"truck\" and describe the two movements as happening concurrently.\n\n### **Improved Caption Example:**\n\n\"From a low-level, level angle, the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera smoothly **dollies backward and trucks to the left**, moving diagonally away from a black Mercedes-Benz S550 parked with its doors open.\"",
