    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"This is a static shot with no camera movement.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Accuracy**\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n*   The camera's position and orientation are fixed throughout the entire video. There is no panning, tilting, dollying, zooming, or any other movement. The statement that the shot is \"static\" and has \"no camera movement\" is factually correct.\n\n#### **2. Completeness**\n\nThe caption is **incomplete**.\n*   While it correctly identifies the lack of movement, it fails to describe other essential aspects of the camera's configuration as required by the instructions.\n\nSpecifically, it is missing:\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The video is clearly filmed from a **high angle**, looking down on the street from an elevated position (likely a tall building). This is a key descriptive element that is omitted.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** The shot exhibits a **deep depth of field**. Both the streetlights and traffic in the midground and the buildings in the far background are in sharp focus. The instruction asks for this to be described.\n\n#### **3. Adherence to the Instruction**\n\nThe caption **partially adheres** to the instructions.\n*   **What it does well:** It follows the rule for conciseness regarding static shots (\"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static\"). It also correctly omits mentions of regular video speed, lack of lens distortion, and lack of a Dutch angle, as per the instruction to avoid stating \"normal\" conditions.\n*   **Where it falls short:** It fails to fulfill the primary instruction, which is to provide a \"concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**.\" By only mentioning the lack of movement, it ignores the required details about the camera's angle, height, and focus, resulting in an overly simplistic and incomplete description.\n\n### **Improved Caption Example**\n\nHere is a caption that more fully adheres to the instructions for this video:\n\n**\"This is a static, high-angle shot with a deep depth of field, keeping the entire nighttime street scene from the midground traffic to the background buildings in sharp focus.\"**",
