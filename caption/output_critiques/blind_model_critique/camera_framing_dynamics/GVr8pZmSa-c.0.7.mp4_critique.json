    "pre_caption": "The camera is underwater, initially at a high angle looking down at a sunken shipwreck. It steadily tilts up while panning left, shifting focus to a diver. During this motion, the camera slightly zooms in to emphasize the diver, eventually transitioning to a worm's eye angle. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above)initially, transitioning to a worm's eye angle at the end.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera steadily tilts up while panning left, shifting focus from the sunken shipwreck to the diver. During the motion, it slightly zooms in to emphasize the diver.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but contains some significant inaccuracies and a logical contradiction. While it correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot (camera height, angle, basic rotation), it misinterprets the camera's movement and focus, which are critical elements according to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **`The camera is underwater, initially at a high angle looking down at a sunken shipwreck.`** - **Correct.** The shot is underwater, starts by looking down on the wreck (high angle).\n    *   **`It steadily tilts up while panning left...`** - **Correct.** The camera's rotation is a clear combination of an upward tilt and a leftward pan.\n    *   **`...eventually transitioning to a worm's eye angle.`** - **Correct.** The final angle is looking almost directly up from below the diver, which is an excellent use of the \"worm's eye\" descriptor.\n    *   **`The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.`** - **Correct.** There is a gentle, organic wobble, characteristic of a diver swimming with a camera.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **`...shifting focus to a diver.`** - **Incorrect.** This is the most significant error. The instruction distinguishes between a *rack focus* (changing the focal plane) and simply moving the camera to frame a new subject. This video uses a **deep focus** (large depth of field), meaning both the shipwreck in the background and the diver in the midground are kept in focus simultaneously. The *attention* shifts to the diver because of the camera's movement, but the *focal plane* does not change.\n    *   **`...the camera slightly zooms in to emphasize the diver...`** - **Incorrect.** The diver appears larger because the camera is physically moving closer to them, not because the lens is zooming. This is a **dolly** or **arc** movement. A zoom would change the focal length, compressing the background and altering the field of view differently. Here, the perspective shift is natural, indicating the camera itself is moving through the space.\n    *   **`The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.`** - This statement, while **accurate on its own**, directly **contradicts** the earlier claim that the camera is \"shifting focus.\" A shot cannot simultaneously be deep focus (everything is sharp) and also be shifting focus from one subject to another.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers angle, height, rotation, steadiness, and depth of field.\n*   It **fails to describe the translational movement**. It mentions pan and tilt (rotation) but omits the crucial **arc** or **dolly/truck** motion where the camera physically moves forward and to the left through the water. This is a key part of the shot's complexity and purpose (to move from one point of interest to another).\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is a good length and is well-structured.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses correct terminology (high angle, tilt, pan, worm's eye, deep focus) but misapplies \"shifting focus\" and \"zoom.\"\n*   **Omissions:** It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as they are not present, which follows the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Clarity:** The contradiction between \"shifting focus\" and \"deep focus\" makes the description confusing and technically incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely describes the video according to your instructions:\n\n**The underwater camera begins at a high angle, looking down at a sunken shipwreck. It performs a slow, continuous counter-clockwise arc while tilting up, smoothly shifting the view from the shipwreck to a diver swimming above. The shot ends at a worm's eye angle looking up towards the diver and the water's surface. The movement is slightly unsteady, and the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping both the wreck and the diver sharp throughout the shot.**",
