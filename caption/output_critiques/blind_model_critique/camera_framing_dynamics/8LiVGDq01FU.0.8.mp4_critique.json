    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level, starting with a level angle that shifts to a low angle as the astronaut looks upward, then returns to level when the astronaut lowers their head. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the astronaut in the midground. It remains mostly stationary but exhibits slight shakiness, tilting up and down to follow the astronaut's head movements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with a level angle, which shifts to a low angle as the character looks upward. When the character lowers their head back to a normal position, the angle returns to level.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera stays mostly stationary but shaky, tilting up and down slightly to follow the astronaut's head movements.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect example of how to follow the instructions precisely and accurately.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of the camera at \"eye level\" is accurate. The dynamic change from a \"level angle\" to a \"low angle\" as it follows the astronaut's upward gaze is perfectly observed and described.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption correctly identifies the \"shallow depth of field,\" which is evident in the sharp focus on the astronaut and the blurred background. Naming the astronaut as the \"midground\" subject is also precise.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description is spot-on. The camera is not on a perfectly stable tripod, so \"mostly stationary but exhibits slight shakiness\" is the ideal description. It correctly identifies the primary movement as \"tilting up and down\" and accurately states its purpose: \"to follow the astronaut's head movements.\"\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\n*   The caption successfully includes all the **relevant** information requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Height:** `eye level`\n    *   **Camera Angle:** `level angle`, `low angle`\n    *   **Movements:** `mostly stationary`, `slight shakiness`, `tilting up and down`, and the purpose of the movement.\n    *   **Focus:** `shallow depth of field`, `focusing on the astronaut in the midground`.\n*   Crucially, it adheres to the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present. There is no mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed:** Because it's at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** Because there is none.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** Because the horizon is level.\n    *   **Complex Movements (Zooming, Dollying, etc.):** Because they do not occur.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** Because it is a single, continuous shot.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is a masterclass in conciseness. It packs a significant amount of technical detail into a single, easy-to-read sentence without any wasted words.\n*   **Use of Specific Terminology:** It correctly uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions, such as `eye level`, `level angle`, `low angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `midground`, and `tilting`.\n*   **Describing Purpose:** It follows the instruction to describe the purpose of the camera movement (\"to follow the astronaut's head movements\"), adding a layer of context that makes the description more meaningful.\n*   **Logical Structure:** The information is presented in a logical flow, starting with the camera's static position and angle, moving to its focus, and finishing with its subtle movements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a perfect response to the prompt because it is accurate in its observations, complete in its coverage of all relevant details, and flawlessly adheres to every rule and guideline in the detailed instructions, especially regarding conciseness and the use of correct terminology.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a camera at eye level, initially at a level angle that transitions to a low angle as the astronaut gazes upward, then returns to level as the astronaut lowers their head. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the astronaut in the midground.
