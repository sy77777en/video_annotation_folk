    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** This appears to be a shot of a TV screen playing a video. While the image on the screen is blurry, the subtitles are clear, suggesting the shot might use deep focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but contains a significant error in its analysis of focus and misattributes a property of the subject to the camera itself.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy: Partially Inaccurate**\n\n*   **Correct Elements:**\n    *   **\"static, level-angle shot\"**: This is accurate. The camera is stationary and positioned straight-on, not from a high or low perspective.\n    *   **\"of a TV screen\"**: This correctly identifies the subject.\n\n*   **Incorrect Elements:**\n    *   **\"The shot appears to use deep focus...\"**: This is incorrect. **Deep focus** means that elements in the foreground, midground, and background are all in sharp focus. This shot does not demonstrate that.\n    *   **\"...as the subtitles at the bottom are clear, while the image on the TV screen itself is blurry\"**: This is a critical misinterpretation. The caption correctly observes the visual characteristics but draws the wrong conclusion. The blurriness of the main image and the sharpness of the subtitles are properties of the *video being played on the TV*, not the result of the camera's depth of field. The camera filming the scene is focused on a single plane: the surface of the TV screen. Since both the blurry image and the sharp subtitles exist on that same plane, the camera is capturing them exactly as they are displayed. This is not an example of shallow or deep focus; it's simply a sharp focus on a subject that has varied internal clarity.\n\n**2. Completeness: Lacks Some Detail**\n\n*   The caption correctly omits video speed and lens distortion, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n*   It successfully identifies the camera movement (static) and angle (level).\n*   It fails to mention **Camera Height**. A detail like \"eye-level\" would add useful context without being verbose.\n*   The description of focus is incomplete because it's based on a flawed premise. It doesn't accurately describe the camera's actual focus setting.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Moderate**\n\n*   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by addressing movement, angle, and focus.\n*   However, it fails on the crucial instruction to accurately describe the focus and depth of field. The instructions emphasize understanding concepts like depth of field, focus planes, and focus changes, and the caption demonstrates a misunderstanding of these principles by confusing the subject's appearance with the camera's optical properties.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fundamentally misinterprets and mislabels the camera's focus. It confuses the aesthetic of the content on the screen with the technical configuration of the camera recording it. A good caption must accurately distinguish between the properties of the camera/shot and the properties of the subject being filmed.\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that follows the provided instructions:\n\n\"This is a static, eye-level, level-angle shot focused sharply on a TV screen. The camera's depth of field is not apparent as the subject exists on a single plane. The video content playing on the screen has a low-resolution, retro aesthetic, featuring a blurry main image contrasted with sharp, clear subtitles.\"",
