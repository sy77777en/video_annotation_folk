    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts off static, briefly zooms in while panning right, and then remains to a static position with slight shaking.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is very good and captures most of the key details accurately, but it contains a minor contradiction that can be improved.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is **very good** but not perfect. It correctly identifies the camera's configuration, focus, and the sequence of movements. Its main weakness is a self-contradictory statement regarding the camera's steadiness.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Highly Accurate:**\n    *   `\"camera at eye level, looking straight ahead\"`: Correct. The height and level angle are accurately described.\n    *   `\"uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp\"`: Correct. The background and midground subjects remain in focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n    *   `\"Initially static, the camera briefly zooms in while panning right to focus on the woman in the gold dress\"`: This is an excellent and precise description of the complex movement. It correctly identifies the initial state, the two simultaneous actions (zoom and pan), the direction, and the purpose.\n    *   `\"It then remains static with slight shaking\"`: Correct. The camera does become static after the movement, and there is a noticeable high-frequency shake or jitter throughout the clip.\n\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy/Contradiction:**\n    *   `\"...maintaining smooth movement throughout.\"`: This phrase contradicts the preceding clause `\"with slight shaking\"`. Shaking is, by definition, a form of unsmooth movement. While the *pan and zoom* action itself is executed smoothly, the overall shot is not perfectly smooth due to the continuous shake. The caption conflates the smoothness of the deliberate action with the unsteadiness of the camera hold.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** Height (`eye level`) and angle (`looking straight ahead` for level angle) are covered.\n    *   **Focus:** `Deep focus` is correctly identified.\n    *   **Movements:** The full sequence is described: `static` -> `zooms in while panning right` -> `static`. It also correctly notes the `slight shaking`.\n    *   **Omissions:** It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none are present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Excellent Adherence:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The description is compact and informative.\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., `static`, `zooms in`, `panning right`, `deep focus`).\n    *   **Temporal Order:** It describes the camera movements in the correct sequence as requested.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The only failure in adherence is the lack of clarity caused by the contradictory final phrase. The instructions prioritize clear and accurate descriptions, which this contradiction undermines.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo resolve the contradiction and make the caption perfectly accurate, you could rephrase the ending to distinguish between the deliberate movement and the overall steadiness.\n\n**Revised Caption (More Detailed):**\n> The video is captured from an eye-level, level angle with deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The shot begins static, then the camera smoothly zooms in while panning right to frame a woman in a gold dress. It holds this new position statically, though a slight, continuous shake is present throughout the clip.\n\n**Revised Caption (More Concise):**\n> From an eye-level, level angle with deep focus, the initially static camera smoothly zooms in and pans right to frame a woman in a gold dress. The shot then remains static, with a slight shake visible throughout.",
