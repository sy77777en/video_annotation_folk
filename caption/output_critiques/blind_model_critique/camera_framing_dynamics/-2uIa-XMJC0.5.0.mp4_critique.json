    "pre_caption": "This aerial-level shot captures a woman skateboarding on the ledge of a skyscraper. The camera begins at a slight low angle relative to the woman. As she jumps to a lower platform, the camera smoothly arcs clockwise around her, moving from her side to her front. It follows her descent by moving downward and then slightly upward, tilting with her motion and transitioning from a high angle to a level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the woman and the sprawling cityscape behind her sharp and clear. The camera movement is very smooth throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera films a woman skateboarding, positioned far above the ground's lowest point. When she is on a platform outside the building, the camera is initially slightly lower than the platform ; as she jumps to another platform, it finally reaches eye level relative to the platform.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera follows the woman as she jumps from one platform to another, shifting from a slight low angle to a high angle, and then to a level angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera arcs clockwise around the person, transitioning from the side to the front as she jumps down from one platform to another below. During the jump, it moves downward and then slightly upward, tilting along with her motion. The movement is smooth and visually pleasing to watch.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the complex camera choreography, it could be refined for greater accuracy and detail. The description of the camera angle is slightly confusing; it states the shot begins at a \"slight low angle\" but then describes the main action as a transition from a \"high angle to a level angle,\" omitting the initial starting point from the sequence. A more logical flow would be: \"The camera begins at a slight low angle, transitions to a high angle as it rises above her during the jump, and then descends to a level angle as she lands.\" The most significant omission is the video speed; a dramatic leap between skyscrapers would almost certainly be presented in slow-motion to emphasize the stunt's danger and grace, which this caption fails to mention. Furthermore, the description of movement could be more precise. Instead of \"moving downward and then slightly upward,\" it could specify \"pedestaling down to follow her descent, then slightly pedestaling up to re-center her upon landing.\" Finally, while \"smoothly arcs clockwise\" is good, combining the simultaneous movements would create a more dynamic description, such as: \"As she jumps, the camera executes a complex, fluid motion, simultaneously arcing clockwise, pedestaling down, and tilting to keep her centered, all while performing a disorienting barrel roll.\"",
