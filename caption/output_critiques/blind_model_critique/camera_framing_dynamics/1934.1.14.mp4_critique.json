    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera exhibits minor, smooth movements without any clear or intentional motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** for this video. While it correctly identifies some aspects, it makes a critical error regarding camera movement and completely omits the most significant feature of the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance against the instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Poor**\n\n*   **Correct:** The description of the camera as being at **eye level** (or a similar mid-level height), having a **level camera angle**, and maintaining **deep focus** with a large depth of field is accurate. The entire room is in focus.\n*   **Incorrect:** The statement, \"The camera exhibits minor, smooth movements without any clear or intentional motion,\" is completely false. The camera is **perfectly static**. The frame does not move at all. The caption writer may have misinterpreted the movement of the clock's hands or the changing light as camera movement, which is a fundamental error.\n\n**Completeness: Poor**\n\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption completely fails to mention the most important characteristic of the video: the **video speed**. This is a **time-lapse** video, evident from the clock hands jumping forward in one-minute increments. The instructions explicitly require specifying the type of speed alteration.\n*   **Incomplete Movement Description:** The instructions state, \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static.\" The caption not only fails to do this but invents movement instead, directly contradicting the instructions and the visual evidence.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Poor**\n\n*   The caption fails to follow the primary instruction to provide an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration\" because it misses the time-lapse and misreports the movement.\n*   While it adheres to the conciseness rule by omitting details like lens distortion (which isn't present), this conciseness comes at the cost of critical information, making it unhelpful.\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a time-lapse video, shot from a static, eye-level position with a level angle. It maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire room from the foreground to the background sharp.\"**",
