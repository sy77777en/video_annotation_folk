    "pre_caption": "This unsteady, first-person POV shot moves forward, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The camera begins at an eye-level, level angle and pans slightly left as it nears a restaurant wall, causing the perspective to shift to a high angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This is a first-person POV shot where the camera moves forward. As it approaches a restaurant wall, it pans slightly to the left to adjust its orientation.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the captioning instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **mostly accurate and well-structured** but contains **one significant error** in terminology that misrepresents the camera's final angle. It successfully follows the instructions for conciseness and uses most of the correct technical vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **\"unsteady, first-person POV shot\"**: Correct. The camera has a natural, handheld shake, and the perspective is clearly meant to simulate what a person sees.\n    *   **\"moves forward\"**: Correct. The camera is dollying forward throughout the shot.\n    *   **\"exhibiting mild barrel distortion\"**: Correct. The vertical lines of the building's architecture and window frames show a slight outward curve, which is characteristic of mild barrel distortion.\n    *   **\"begins at an eye-level, level angle\"**: Correct. The shot starts at a typical standing height, looking straight ahead.\n    *   **\"pans slightly left\"**: Correct. As the camera approaches the wall, it rotates horizontally to the left to keep the wall in frame.\n    *   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. The ground in the immediate foreground, the wall in the midground, and the sky in the background are all in sharp focus.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **\"...causing the perspective to shift to a high angle.\"**: **This is incorrect.** A **high angle** shot is when the camera looks *down* on a subject. In the video, as the camera gets closer to the tall building, it **tilts up** to look at the upper floors. This creates a **low angle** shot, making the building appear imposing. The caption confuses these two fundamental terms.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is quite complete but misses one key detail from the instructions:\n\n*   **Missing Movement Description:** The caption correctly identifies the *result* of the vertical movement (a change in angle) but fails to name the movement itself. The instructions ask to specify movements like \"tilting.\" The camera clearly **tilts up** to create the low angle. Mentioning the \"tilt\" would make the description more complete and precise.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption does an excellent job of being concise while packing in a lot of information, as requested.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms like \"barrel distortion,\" \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" \"pan,\" and \"deep focus.\" The only failure in terminology is the misuse of \"high angle.\"\n*   **Handling Omissions:** It correctly follows the instruction to omit details that are standard (e.g., regular video speed, no Dutch angle), which contributes to its conciseness.\n*   **Describing Movement:** It describes the movements in temporal order (\"begins at... and pans... as it nears\"), which is good. However, as noted above, it omits the \"tilt\" movement.\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the error and improves its completeness:\n\n**\"This unsteady, first-person POV shot moves forward, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The camera begins at an eye-level, level angle, then pans left and tilts up as it nears the restaurant wall, shifting the perspective to a low angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n1.  **Corrects the Angle:** It accurately identifies the final perspective as a **low angle**.\n2.  **Adds the Missing Movement:** It explicitly states that the camera **tilts up**, explaining *how* the angle changed.\n3.  **Improves Flow:** It clearly sequences the movements: \"pans left and tilts up.\"\n4.  **Maintains Strengths:** It retains all the accurate descriptions from the original caption (unsteady POV, forward movement, distortion, and deep focus).",
