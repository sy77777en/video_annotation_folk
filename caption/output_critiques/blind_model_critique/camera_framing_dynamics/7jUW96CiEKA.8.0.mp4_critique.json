    "pre_caption": "The camera, positioned above water, starts with a slow pan to the left, focusing on a heron by the water's edge. It then remains static, maintaining a level angle. The deep focus ensures both the heron and its surroundings are sharp, with smooth, steady movement throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly pans left at first, then remains static until the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the captioning instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is good but contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the camera movement that misrepresents the video's structure. While it correctly identifies several key elements, this error makes it a flawed description.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"positioned above water\" is correct.\n    *   **Initial Movement:** \"starts with a slow pan to the left\" is a perfect description of the initial action.\n    *   **Subject:** The movement's purpose is indeed to focus on \"a heron by the water's edge.\"\n    *   **Static Phase:** \"It then remains static\" is correct. The camera stops moving.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"maintaining a level angle\" is accurate. The horizon is not tilted.\n    *   **Focus:** \"The deep focus ensures both the heron and its surroundings are sharp\" is an excellent and accurate description of the depth of field.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   The final clause, **\"with smooth, steady movement throughout,\"** is incorrect. This directly contradicts the earlier, correct statement that the camera \"remains static.\" The movement is only present in the first half of the video; the second half is completely still. This is a major inaccuracy as it mischaracterizes the entire shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Included:** The caption successfully covers the most important aspects required by the instructions:\n    *   Camera Height (`above water`)\n    *   Camera Movement (`pan to the left`, `static`)\n    *   Camera Angle (`level angle`)\n    *   Focus (`deep focus`)\n    *   Steadiness (`smooth, steady`)\n\n*   **What's Missing or Could Be Improved:**\n    *   The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details like \"regular video speed\" and \"no lens distortion.\" This is a point of strength.\n    *   While it describes the movement phases (\"starts with... then remains static\"), the contradictory final clause undermines this structure. A complete description would clearly separate the two distinct phases of the shot without contradiction.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strong Adherence:**\n    *   The caption uses the specific terminology requested, such as **\"pan,\" \"static,\" \"level angle,\"** and **\"deep focus.\"**\n    *   It correctly describes the camera height in relation to the environment (`above water`).\n    *   It attempts to describe the movement in temporal order, as requested.\n\n*   **Weak Adherence:**\n    *   The primary failure is in accurately describing the **complexity and duration of movement**. The instructions emphasize describing movements in temporal order and noting when they change or stop. By incorrectly stating there is \"movement throughout,\" the caption fails to follow this crucial part of the instruction.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracy and better adheres to the instructions by clearly separating the two phases of the shot:\n\n**\"Positioned above water at a level angle, the camera performs a slow, steady pan to the left, settling on a heron at the water's edge. The shot then becomes static for the remainder of its duration. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the heron in the midground to the distant background, sharply in view.\"**",
