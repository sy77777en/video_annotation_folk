    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing clockwise.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while arcing around them.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n**The caption is very good.** It is concise, accurate (assuming it matches the video), and successfully incorporates most of the key technical elements required by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the caption is highly accurate and plausible.\n*   **\"camera at eye level with a low angle, looking up\"**: This is a perfectly valid and clear description. It implies the camera is held at a normal height, but the subject is taller or positioned higher, forcing the camera to tilt upward.\n*   **\"extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground\"**: This correctly identifies the focus technique and the subject plane, which is a key cinematic choice.\n*   **\"arcs clockwise around him, tracking his movement\"**: This clearly describes two simultaneous, complex movements. \"Arcing\" describes the circular path, and \"tracking\" clarifies that the camera is also moving to follow the subject's own motion.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, with some shaking\"**: This provides a good sense of the shot's stability, suggesting a handheld or shoulder-mounted camera.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is quite complete but misses a couple of minor details that could make it even better according to the instructions.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Camera Height:** Included (\"eye level\").\n*   **Camera Angle:** Included (\"low angle, looking up\").\n*   **Focus (Depth & Plane):** Included (\"extremely shallow depth of field,\" \"focusing on the man in the foreground\").\n*   **Movement (Type & Steadiness):** Included (\"arcs clockwise,\" \"tracking,\" \"slightly unsteady\").\n\n**Minor Omissions/Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Speed of Movement:** The instructions ask for the speed of camera movements (e.g., slow, moderate, fast). The caption describes the type of movement but not its pace. Adding whether the arc is slow or fast would add valuable information.\n*   **Focus Changes:** The instructions mention describing dynamic focus changes like *focus tracking*. While the caption implies this by saying the camera is \"tracking his movement,\" explicitly stating that the camera is **focus tracking** the subject would be slightly more precise and aligned with the provided terminology.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the spirit and letter of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** It is an excellent example of a concise yet informative description. It avoids unnecessary words while packing in a lot of technical detail.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** It correctly avoids mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, which the instructions state should be omitted if they are standard or not present. This shows a good understanding of the \"less is more\" principle in the guidelines.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"arc,\" \"tracking,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a high-quality response that fulfills the core requirements of the prompt. It is well-written, technically sound, and demonstrates a strong understanding of camera and video terminology.\n\nTo make it perfect, you could make the following minor addition:\n\n**Slightly Improved Version:**\n\"The video features a camera at eye level with a low angle, looking up. It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera performs a **slow**, slightly unsteady clockwise arc around him, **tracking** his movement and maintaining focus.\"\n\nThis revised version adds the **speed** of the movement, making it fully comprehensive according to the instructions.",
