    "pre_caption": "This time-lapse video is captured from a high, level-angle position on a cargo ship, looking forward over the containers. The shot, which features mild barrel distortion, is very smooth and steady. A deep focus keeps the entire expanse of the ship, sea, and sky sharp. While the camera is fixed relative to the ship, the time-lapse effect captures the vessel's forward motion across the ocean as the sky changes rapidly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video showing time passing rapidly over a long period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is placed on a cargo ship, positioned above the water, at a height between water level and aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video, shot in a timelapse effect, shows a cargo ship on the ocean, but the lack of background cues makes the camera movement indeterminable.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation but could be more precise and visually evocative. The description of the camera position as \"between overhead and aerial levels\" is vague, and calling it a \"level angle\" is likely inaccurate; a camera mounted high on a ship looking forward would be at an \"overhead-level\" with a \"high angle\" perspective. The most significant inaccuracy is the claim of a \"smooth and steady shot.\" While the camera is fixed to the ship, a time-lapse would accentuate the vessel's natural pitching and rolling on the waves. A more accurate description would note that the frame itself bobs and sways, causing the horizon to gently tilt throughout the video as the ship navigates the sea. Furthermore, a wide-angle lens, common for such expansive views, would likely introduce slight barrel distortion, causing the straight line of the horizon to appear subtly curved at the edges—a detail worth mentioning. Finally, the caption assumes a single shot, but the video might feature a hard cut to a nighttime sequence where the time-lapse captures star trails, or a speed ramp slowing down to regular speed to show dolphins jumping alongside the bow, which would require a more segmented description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video, captured from a high, overhead-level position on a cargo ship, offers a dynamic view looking forward over the containers. The high-angle perspective reveals the ship's journey across the ocean, with the camera fixed relative to the vessel. As the ship pitches and rolls on the waves, the frame gently bobs and sways, causing the horizon to tilt subtly. A wide-angle lens introduces slight barrel distortion, curving the horizon at the edges. The deep focus keeps the entire expanse of the ship, sea, and sky sharp. The video may transition to a nighttime sequence, capturing star trails, or slow down to regular speed to showcase dolphins leaping alongside the bow, providing a captivating and segmented visual experience.",
