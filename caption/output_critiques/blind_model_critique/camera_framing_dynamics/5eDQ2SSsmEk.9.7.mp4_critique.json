    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video shows an environment that resembles space, with a dark background, making it difficult to determine the camera height, but it appears to be aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is rolling counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** and largely accurate. It correctly identifies the most prominent camera characteristics (angle, focus, and movement). However, it could be improved by using more precise terminology and increasing its conciseness, as per the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate.** The caption correctly identifies the key elements:\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus and large depth of field\" is accurate. Everything from the Earth in the midground to the stars in the background is sharp.\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"aerial level\" is the perfect term to describe a shot from space, as specified in the instructions.\n    *   **Movement:** \"rolls counterclockwise smoothly and slowly, maintaining steadiness\" is a precise and correct description of the camera's rotation.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy/Imprecision:**\n    *   The term \"high-angle view\" is technically correct but not the most specific. Since the camera is looking straight down, a **\"bird's-eye view\"** would be more precise.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Very Good.** The caption successfully covers all the *relevant* aspects of the camera's configuration present in the video.\n*   It correctly follows the instruction to omit details that are not present, such as:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's at a regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The rotation is a deliberate camera roll, not a static tilted horizon.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Good, but could be more concise.** The instructions emphasize being \"concise yet informative.\" The caption has some redundancies that could be eliminated.\n    *   `high-angle view, looking down from above`: The phrase \"looking down from above\" is redundant with \"high-angle view.\"\n    *   `deep focus and large depth of field`: These two terms describe the same visual effect. Using just one is more concise.\n    *   `resembling a space environment`: This describes the video's *content*, not the *camera's configuration*, which is the primary focus of the instructions. While helpful context, it's not strictly required by the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more concise and uses more precise terminology, fully adhering to all instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nFrom a steady, aerial-level, bird's-eye angle, the camera rolls slowly and counterclockwise. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
