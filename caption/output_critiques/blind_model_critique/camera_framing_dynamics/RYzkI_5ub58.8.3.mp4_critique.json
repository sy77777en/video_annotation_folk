    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on a very narrow plane. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is accurate and concise, but it is incomplete according to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\nEverything stated in the caption is correct.\n*   **\"This is a static shot...\"**: Correct. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way. The subject moves within the frame, but the camera itself is stationary.\n*   **\"...with an extremely shallow depth of field.\"**: Correct. This is the most prominent visual characteristic of the video. Only a very thin plane is in focus, causing the background and immediate foreground to be heavily blurred.\n*   **\"The camera is focused on the midground, capturing the weevil's head and snout in sharp detail.\"**: Correct. The focus is precisely on the weevil, which is in the midground, and the sharpest point is its head.\n\n### Completeness: Good but Incomplete\nThe caption successfully identifies the most important aspects of the shot (its static nature and shallow depth of field) but omits one required descriptive element.\n\n*   **What's Missing:** The caption fails to mention the **camera angle**. The instructions state to \"specify the camera angle, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*.\" In this video, the camera is positioned above the weevil and looking down, making it a **high-angle** shot. This is a discernible and required piece of information that should have been included.\n\n*   **What's Correctly Omitted:** Following the instructions for conciseness, the caption correctly omits any mention of video speed (which is regular), lens distortion (none is visible), or Dutch angle (the horizon is level).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions: Good\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions but misses a key requirement.\n\n*   **Strengths:** It is concise, uses appropriate terminology (\"static,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground\"), and correctly focuses on the most significant visual features. It correctly avoids mentioning attributes that are absent or at their default setting.\n*   **Weakness:** Its primary failure in adherence is not including the camera angle, which is explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n### Improved Caption\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the missing information and fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a static, high-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground, capturing the weevil's head and snout in sharp detail.\"**",
