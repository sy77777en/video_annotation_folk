    "pre_caption": "Filmed from a hip-level, level angle, this shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a person in the midground preparing a bowl of fruit. The slightly unsteady handheld camera moves back and then forward, maintaining focus on the person's hands as they add toppings to the bowl.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera slightly moves backward, then forward, focusing on a person making a fruit salad.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the handheld nature of the shot, it could be more precise and descriptive. The term \"hip-level angle\" is confusing, as it conflates camera height with its angle relative to the subject; a more accurate description would be a \"high-angle shot from hip-height,\" which clarifies that the camera is positioned low but pointing downward at the bowl on a table or counter. The description of movement, \"moves back and then forward,\" is vague and could be improved by using the technical term \"dollies out and then back in.\" Furthermore, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the purpose of this movement, which is likely to first reveal the context of the scene and then push in to emphasize the action of adding toppings. The caption also omits any mention of video speed; food videography often employs subtle slow-motion as the toppings are sprinkled to add a sense of elegance, and if present, this would be a critical detail to include. Finally, while the focus is well-described, the caption could also note if there is a slight pan or tilt to follow the hands as they move from the ramekin to the bowl, a common technique to keep the primary action centered.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Filmed from a high-angle shot at hip-height, this scene uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a person in the midground preparing a bowl of fruit. The slightly unsteady handheld camera dollies out to reveal the context of the scene and then dollies back in to emphasize the action of adding toppings. The camera maintains focus on the person's hands, possibly incorporating a subtle pan or tilt to follow their movement from the ramekin to the bowl. If present, the use of slow-motion as the toppings are sprinkled adds a sense of elegance to the scene.",
