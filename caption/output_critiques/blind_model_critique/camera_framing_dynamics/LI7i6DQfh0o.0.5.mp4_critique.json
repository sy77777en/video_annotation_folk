    "pre_caption": "Filmed from a hip-level, level angle, this shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a person in the midground preparing a bowl of fruit.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera slightly moves backward, then forward, focusing on a person making a fruit salad.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions by being both informative and concise.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Position:** The description of a \"hip-level, level angle\" is precise and correctly identifies the camera's placement relative to the subject and the ground.\n    *   **Focus:** The caption accurately identifies the \"shallow depth of field\" and correctly places the subject in the \"midground.\"\n    *   **Movement:** The description of the camera moving \"back and then forward\" is a clear and accurate summary of the dolly-like motion. The \"slightly unsteady handheld\" quality is also correctly noted.\n    *   **Subject Action:** The caption correctly identifies the action (\"preparing a bowl of fruit,\" \"add toppings\") and how the camera's focus follows it (\"maintaining focus on the person's hands\").\n\n*   **Completeness:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects requested in the instructions: camera height, angle, movement (translation, steadiness, purpose), and focus (depth, plane, and dynamic changes).\n    *   It effectively describes the purpose of the movement and focus, which is to keep the viewer's attention on the hands preparing the food.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is a model of conciseness. As instructed, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all standard or absent in the video. This makes the description clean and easy to read.\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses appropriate and descriptive terms like \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground,\" and \"handheld\" without being overly technical. The phrase \"moves back and then forward\" is a perfectly clear substitute for \"dollies out and then in.\"\n    *   **Structure:** The information is presented in a logical flow, starting with the static setup (height, angle, focus) and then describing the dynamic elements (movement).",
