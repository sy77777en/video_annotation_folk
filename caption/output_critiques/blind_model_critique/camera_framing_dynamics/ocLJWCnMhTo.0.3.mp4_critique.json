    "pre_caption": "This unsteady shot begins at a hip-level, level angle on a man standing by a table. The camera then cranes up in an arc, raising the viewpoint to eye level and shifting the perspective to a bird's-eye view looking down at the table. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is craning up in an arc.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good overview, but it could be more precise and evocative by refining a few key descriptions. The phrase \"cranes up in an arc\" is slightly ambiguous; \"craning\" typically refers to vertical movement, while \"arcing\" is horizontal. Based on my viewing, the camera appears to be on a jib arm, executing a combined movement: it **pedestals up** from hip-level while simultaneously **tilting down** to keep the table centered, smoothly transitioning from a level angle to a final bird's-eye view. The description of the shot as \"unsteady\" is a good start, but it could be specified as a **moderate handheld wobble**, suggesting a deliberate, organic feel rather than a technical error. Furthermore, while the focus is consistent, calling it \"deep focus\" might be an overstatement; I observed a **medium depth of field**, where the man and the table are perfectly sharp, but the kitchen background is noticeably soft, which helps isolate the subject. Finally, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the **purpose and speed** of the movement; for instance, you could add that the camera moves **slowly and deliberately** to shift the audience's focus from the chef as a person to the intricate details of the ingredients on the table below him.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with a moderate handheld wobble at hip-level, capturing a man standing by a table. The camera, mounted on a jib arm, pedestals up from hip-level while simultaneously tilting down, smoothly transitioning from a level angle to a bird's-eye view centered on the table. The movement is slow and deliberate, guiding the audience's focus from the chef to the intricate details of the ingredients on the table. The shot maintains a medium depth of field, keeping the man and the table in sharp focus while softly blurring the kitchen background, effectively isolating the subject.",
