    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, capturing a butterfly collecting nectar. The camera is at a high angle with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the butterfly in the midground. The handheld camera moves slowly and slightly unsteadily, gradually approaching the butterfly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera captures a butterfly collecting nectar, slowly adjusting its position while gradually approaching it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the slow-motion effect and the basic camera movement, it lacks the specificity needed to fully capture the nuances of the shot. The description of the camera angle as simply \"high\" is incomplete; as the camera dollies in and tilts down, it transitions from a high angle to a more intimate, eye-level perspective with the butterfly, a crucial detail that is omitted. The term \"shallow depth of field\" is accurate but could be more precise; the video likely employs an *ultra-shallow* depth of field where the focus is critically sharp only on the butterfly's head and proboscis, while its wingtips and the immediate flower petals fall into a soft blur. Calling the butterfly the \"midground\" is also imprecise for a macro shot where it is the primary subject occupying the main focal plane. Lastly, the description of movement could be enhanced. In addition to dollying forward and tilting, the handheld camera almost certainly performs subtle, reactive tracking movements, panning and trucking slightly to keep the butterfly centered as it feeds, which is a key element of the shot's organic feel that the current caption overlooks.",
