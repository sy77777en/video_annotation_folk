    "pre_caption": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective with a level angle, the camera uses a deep focus to keep the chaotic battle scene sharp.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera arcs clockwise around two movie characters then rapidly pans left to keep both of them centered. The motion is unsteady due to the intensity of the fighting scene.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is mostly good and captures the general feel and movement of the camera. However, it contains **one major inaccuracy** regarding the camera's focus and could be slightly more precise in its description of the movement, according to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:**\n    *   **Perspective and Steadiness:** \"unsteady, eye-level perspective with a level angle\" is perfectly accurate. The camera is shaky, positioned at roughly the characters' eye level, and the horizon is not tilted.\n    *   **Movement Description:** \"arcs clockwise around the two central movie characters, then rapidly pans left\" is a correct description of the camera's path.\n    *   **Purpose:** \"enhancing the intensity of the fight\" is an accurate interpretation of the cinematographic choice. The shaky, reactive camera work is a common technique to immerse the viewer in the chaos of an action scene.\n\n*   **What it gets wrong (Major Inaccuracy):**\n    *   **Focus:** The caption states the camera uses a **\"deep focus to keep the chaotic battle scene sharp.\" This is incorrect.** The video clearly demonstrates a **shallow depth of field**.\n        *   **Evidence:** Only the two central characters in the midground are in sharp focus. The background, filled with other combatants and explosions, is heavily blurred (bokeh). The foreground is also out of focus when the sword swings past the lens.\n        *   **Purpose of the Focus:** The shallow focus is intentionally used to *isolate* the main characters from the surrounding chaos, directing the viewer's attention specifically to their duel, rather than keeping the entire scene sharp.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise, as requested, but it misses a few key details that would have made it more complete according to the instructions.\n\n*   **Focus:** Beyond the deep/shallow error, the caption could have specified the **focus plane** (midground) and noted that the camera is performing **focus tracking** by keeping the moving subjects consistently sharp.\n*   **Movement:** The instructions mention \"tracking.\" The camera isn't just arcing around a fixed point; it is also **tracking** the subjects as they move and fight. Combining these terms (e.g., \"tracks and arcs clockwise\") would be more precise. The \"rapidly pans left\" could also be more specifically described as a **\"whip pan,\"** a common term for such a fast, motion-blurring pan.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It successfully followed the instruction to be concise and omit unnecessary information (e.g., it correctly did not mention video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none were present).\n    *   It correctly identified and described camera height, angle, and the primary movements (arc, pan).\n    *   It correctly identified the camera's steadiness (shaky/unsteady) and the purpose of the movement.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   It failed to correctly apply the instruction regarding **focus and depth of field**, which was a significant part of the prompt. This is the main area where the caption did not adhere to the instructions.\n    *   It could have adhered more closely by including terms like \"tracking\" and specifying the \"focus plane\" to provide a more informative description as requested.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and incorporates the missing details, while remaining concise:\n\n**\"From a shaky, eye-level perspective with a level angle, the camera uses a shallow depth of field to keep the two central characters in sharp focus on the midground plane, blurring the chaotic background. The camera tracks and arcs clockwise with the fighters, then executes a rapid whip pan to the left to follow one character. The unsteady, reactive movement enhances the intensity of the fight.\"**",
