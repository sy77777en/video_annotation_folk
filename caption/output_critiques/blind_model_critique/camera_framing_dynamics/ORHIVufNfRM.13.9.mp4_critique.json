    "pre_caption": "The underwater camera begins at a high angle, looking down at the seafloor, and then transitions to a level angle as it follows the player's descent and ascent through the water. The camera maintains a variable Dutch angle due to rolling, and employs a shallow depth of field focused on the player's immediate foreground, such as the player's hands and nearby underwater objects. Camera movement is smooth and continuous, simulating the player's forward swimming motion—initially moving downward, then upward as the player changes direction. At the end, the camera pans right while simultaneously trucking left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, simulating the player's perspective while exploring the sea, moves forward continuously. Initially, as the player swims downward, the camera gradually follows, moving down. When the player swims upward, it moves up. At the end, the camera pans right while trucking left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, very comprehensive, and demonstrates a strong understanding of both the video content and the specific terminological requirements of the instructions. It successfully balances detail with conciseness.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is extremely accurate in its description of the camera's properties and movements.\n\n*   **Angle Transition:** The description of the camera starting at a **high angle** and transitioning to a **level angle** is precise. This correctly captures the initial downward gaze followed by forward movement.\n*   **Dutch Angle:** Identifying the **variable Dutch angle due to rolling** is a sophisticated and correct observation. The camera does tilt on its axis as the player character turns and swims, which is perfectly described.\n*   **Depth of Field & Focus:** The analysis of a **shallow depth of field** focused on the **immediate foreground** (hands, tools, nearby objects) is spot-on. The background is consistently blurred, directing the viewer's attention.\n*   **Movement Simulation:** The statement that the movement is **smooth, continuous, and simulates swimming** is accurate. The description of the path—**initially downward, then upward**—correctly follows the player's actions.\n*   **Final Movement:** The description of the final action as a **pan right while simultaneously trucking left** is a perfect and technically correct analysis of the common \"circle-strafe\" movement in video games.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete and covers nearly all the required elements from the instructions.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly omits any mention of video speed, adhering to the instruction to leave it out if it's at a regular playback rate.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The only minor omission is the lack of mention of lens distortion. The video exhibits a slight **barrel distortion** characteristic of a wide-angle lens (common in first-person games to increase the field of view). Straight lines near the edges of the frame would appear slightly curved. However, given its subtlety, omitting it for the sake of conciseness is an acceptable choice.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** Both are covered well. **\"Underwater\"** serves as the height descriptor, and the angles (high, level) and their transitions are detailed.\n*   **Movements:** The caption excels here. It describes the type (pan, truck, roll), quality (smooth, continuous), direction (downward, upward), and purpose (simulating swimming) of the movements.\n*   **Focus:** The depth of field, focus plane (foreground), and the subject of the focus are all clearly and correctly described.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption packs a significant amount of technical information into a few clear sentences without being overly verbose.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms like `Dutch angle`, `rolling`, `shallow depth of field`, `pan`, and `truck`.\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description follows the temporal flow of the video, describing the initial state, the main movement, and the final action in chronological order.\n*   **Omission of Redundancy:** It correctly follows the negative constraint by not mentioning regular video speed or the absence of major lens distortion, which demonstrates a full understanding of the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a model caption that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt. It is technically precise, well-structured, and demonstrates a high level of observational skill. The only possible addition would be a mention of the slight barrel distortion, but its omission does not significantly detract from the caption's overall quality.",
