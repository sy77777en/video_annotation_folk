    "pre_caption": "From a smooth, aerial perspective, the camera leads a drone from the front, moving backward with a deep focus that keeps both the drone and the mountainous landscape sharp. The shot begins at a level angle but then executes a sudden clockwise roll, ending in an upside-down orientation and creating a varying Dutch angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward, and in the middle of the video, it suddenly rolls clockwise and ends up upside down.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the aerial perspective, backward motion, and the dramatic roll, it could be more precise and evocative. The phrase \"leads a drone from the front, moving backward\" could be refined to a \"smooth reverse tracking shot,\" which better conveys that the camera is actively following the subject drone's specific flight path. The description of \"deep focus\" is correct, but given the likely use of a wide-angle lens, it would be more informative to note the drone is held sharp in the midground against an equally sharp mountainous background, as this is a natural characteristic of such a setup. The caption also misses the subtle but noticeable *barrel distortion* from the wide-angle lens, which would cause the horizon to curve slightly at the edges. Most importantly, the \"sudden clockwise roll\" feels unmotivated as described; in the video, the camera's roll directly mimics an identical maneuver performed by the subject drone, creating a dynamic, synchronized action sequence. The caption would be much stronger if it linked the camera's movement to the drone's action. Finally, the movement is likely more complex than just a backward dolly and a roll; the camera also appears to be subtly *craning down* as it follows the drone into a lower part of the valley, a detail that adds to the shot's complexity and dynamism.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera captures a smooth reverse tracking shot, following the drone's precise flight path with a wide-angle lens that keeps both the drone sharp in the midground and the mountainous background equally crisp. The lens introduces a subtle barrel distortion, gently curving the horizon at the edges. As the drone performs a dynamic clockwise roll, the camera mirrors this maneuver, creating a synchronized action sequence. The shot begins at a level angle and incorporates a subtle craning down movement, enhancing the complexity and dynamism as it follows the drone into a lower part of the valley.",
