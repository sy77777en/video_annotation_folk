    "pre_caption": "The video features a drone camera at an overhead level, capturing a racing car executing a drift. The camera angle is high, looking down from above, with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone smoothly tracks the car from behind, moving forward, panning left, and slightly rolling counterclockwise to create a dynamic Dutch angle as it positions itself in front of the car. The movement is visually dynamic and smooth, with no shaking, providing a pleasing aerial view of the drifting car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone smoothly flies above a racing car executing a drift. It tracks the car from behind while moving forward, panning left, and slightly rolling counterclockwise to create a Dutch angle as it positions itself in front of the car. The drone's movement is visually dynamic and pleasing to watch.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is very detailed and captures most of the key technical aspects of the video. Here is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is very good. It is accurate in its primary descriptions, covers most of the required elements, and follows the spirit of the instructions. There are minor areas where precision and conciseness could be improved.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the events and camera work.\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera & Subject:** Correctly identifies a \"drone camera\" capturing a \"racing car executing a drift.\"\n    *   **Height & Angle:** \"Overhead level\" and \"high angle\" are accurate descriptors.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The observation of a \"varying Dutch angle due to rolling\" is excellent and precise.\n    *   **Focus:** \"Deep focus with a large depth of field\" is a perfect description. Everything from the car to the track markings and grass is sharp.\n    *   **Movement & Steadiness:** The description of the movement as \"smoothly tracks,\" \"moving forward,\" \"panning left,\" and \"rolling counterclockwise\" is correct. The observation that there is \"no shaking\" is also accurate.\n\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:**\n    *   The phrase \"as it positions itself in front of the car\" is slightly misleading. The camera moves from behind the car to a position *alongside and slightly ahead* of it, but it never gets fully in front of the car to capture it head-on. It maintains a side/quarter view throughout the latter half of the drift.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is quite complete, but it could incorporate more specific terminology from the instructions to be even more comprehensive.\n\n*   **What's Included:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** Yes (\"overhead level\").\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Yes (\"high angle,\" \"Dutch angle\").\n    *   **Focus:** Yes (\"deep focus,\" \"large depth of field\").\n    *   **Movement:** Yes, it describes tracking, panning, and rolling.\n    *   **Steadiness:** Yes (\"smooth,\" \"no shaking\").\n\n*   **What Could Be Added or Refined:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** While \"high angle\" is correct, the shot begins as a near-perfect **bird's-eye view** before transitioning. Mentioning this transition would add precision.\n    *   **Movement Type:** The combination of \"moving forward\" (dollying) and \"panning left\" while following the car's curve is best described as **arcing**. Using this term would be more concise and technically specific. The camera performs a smooth counterclockwise arc around the car.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The final sentence, \"...providing a pleasing aerial view of the drifting car,\" is subjective and adds commentary rather than technical information. The instruction emphasizes a concise, informative description of the configuration. This part could be omitted to improve conciseness.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the detailed instructions provided.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly omits any mention of **video speed** or **lens distortion**, as they are normal/not present, following the rule to only mention them if they are a feature.\n    *   It correctly identifies and explains the **Dutch angle** as a result of camera rolling.\n    *   It describes the **focus** and **depth of field** accurately.\n    *   It details the **camera movements** in a logical sequence.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** As mentioned, the final subjective phrase could be removed. The phrase \"looking down from above\" is redundant after stating the angle is \"high.\"\n    *   **Use of Terminology:** While the description of movement is good, using more specific terms from the instructions like **\"arcing\"** would demonstrate a higher level of adherence.\n\n### Revised Caption (for comparison)\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback to be more accurate, complete, and concise, while strictly adhering to the instructions:\n\n> The video is captured by a drone from an overhead, bird's-eye angle that transitions to a high angle. The camera maintains deep focus throughout. The shot begins by tracking a drifting car from behind, then smoothly arcs counterclockwise while rolling to create a dynamic Dutch angle. This complex movement—combining forward motion, leftward trucking, and leftward panning—is perfectly steady.",
