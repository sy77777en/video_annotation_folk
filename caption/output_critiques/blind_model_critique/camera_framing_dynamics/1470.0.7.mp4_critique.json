    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

The camera is quite unsteady, moving without a clear pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good starting point and is accurate in several aspects, but it is incomplete and slightly misleading regarding the camera's movement, failing to fully adhere to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **\"shot at eye level with a level camera angle\"**: **Accurate.** The perspective is consistent with someone holding a camera while walking.\n*   **\"maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field\"**: **Accurate.** Everything from the foreground to the distant buildings is in sharp focus.\n*   **\"The camera is quite unsteady\"**: **Accurate.** The handheld nature of the shot results in significant shaking and wobbling.\n*   **\"moving without a clear pattern\"**: **Partially Inaccurate/Misleading.** While the shaking is erratic, the camera has a very clear overall movement: it is tracking forward down the street. This primary motion has a clear direction and purpose (to show a POV of walking), which the caption misses entirely.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **What it does well:** The caption correctly identifies the camera's height, angle, focus, and steadiness. It also correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting mentions of normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n*   **Where it falls short:** The main failure is in describing the **camera movement**. The instructions ask for the **type, direction, and purpose** of the movement (e.g., tracking, dollying, panning). The caption only describes the *quality* of the movement (unsteady) and incorrectly dismisses its overall pattern. It fails to mention the primary **forward tracking** motion.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from an eye-level perspective with a level angle, the video maintains deep focus. The handheld camera is very unsteady as it tracks forward along a city street, capturing a first-person point-of-view.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n*   **Describes Movement Type and Direction:** It correctly identifies the primary movement as \"tracks forward.\"\n*   **Explains the Purpose:** It clarifies the purpose of the movement is to capture a \"first-person point-of-view.\"\n*   **More Precise Language:** It replaces the misleading \"moving without a clear pattern\" with a more accurate description that separates the unsteadiness from the intentional forward motion.",
