    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera moves smoothly forward through an underwater environment at a level angle.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a first-person perspective as it moves forward with intermittent downward motion and concludes with a slight pan to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly adheres to the rules of conciseness and terminology.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical and visual elements.\n\n*   **\"From a first-person perspective...\"**: Correct. The camera's viewpoint makes the viewer feel as if they are the one moving through the scene.\n*   **\"...the camera moves smoothly forward...\"**: Correct. The primary motion is a steady, continuous forward dolly. The word \"smoothly\" accurately captures the perfect steadiness, which is typical of a CG animation.\n*   **\"...through an underwater environment at a level angle.\"**: Correct. The setting is clearly underwater, and the camera maintains a level, forward-facing angle without tilting up or down.\n*   **\"The movement includes intermittent downward shifts...\"**: Correct. This is a great observation. The camera doesn't just move in a perfectly straight line; it has subtle, gentle vertical drifts, which \"intermittent downward shifts\" describes well.\n*   **\"...and concludes with a slight pan to the right.\"**: Correct. At the very end of the clip, the camera rotates horizontally to the right.\n*   **\"A deep focus is used, keeping the entire alien-like seascape in sharp detail.\"**: Correct. Every element, from the particles in the foreground to the distant structures in the background, is in sharp focus. This is a perfect description of deep focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information fenômeno the instructions while correctly omitting what isn't present.\n\n*   **Included Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Movement:** It comprehensively covers the primary movement (forward), secondary movements (downward shifts, pan), and steadiness (smoothly).\n    *   **Camera Angle/Height:** \"Level angle\" and \"underwater environment\" are both specified.\n    *   **Focus:** \"Deep focus\" is clearly stated and explained.\n    *   **Perspective:** \"First-person perspective\" is noted, which is a key part of the shot's feel.\n\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there was no need to mention transitions.\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instruction to only describe what is present and relevant.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption follows the formatting and stylistic guidelines perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The description is packed into three clear sentences. It avoids unnecessary words while providing a complete technical picture of the shot.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms like \"pan,\" \"level angle,\" and \"deep focus\" appropriately.\n*   **Clarity and Structure:** The information is presented logically. The first sentence establishes the overall shot and primary motion. The second details the secondary movements. The third describes the focus. This structure is easy to follow.\n*   **Descriptive Quality:** The phrase \"alien-like seascape\" is a nice, concise addition that gives context to the scene without violating the technical focus of the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not just good; it is an exemplary execution of the instructions. It is precise, thorough, and well-written, capturing all the specified cinematic properties of the video with professional clarity. There are no corrections or improvements to suggest.",
