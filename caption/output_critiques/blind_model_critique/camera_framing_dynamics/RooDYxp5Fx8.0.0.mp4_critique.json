    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video.\n\n*   **\"eye-level, level-angle shot\"**: This is correct. The camera is held at a height and angle consistent with a person's natural line of sight while walking.\n*   **\"deep focus that keeps the entire street scene sharp\"**: This is also correct. The sidewalk in the foreground, the cars in the midground, and the buildings in the background are all in focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"camera moves forward along the sidewalk\"**: The primary movement is a forward dolly/tracking motion, which is accurately described.\n*   **\"slight, natural unsteadiness, suggesting a walking perspective\"**: This perfectly captures the handheld quality of the shot. The movement isn't perfectly smooth, but it's not jarringly shaky either. The caption correctly identifies the purpose of this unsteadiness—to simulate a first-person point-of-view.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is complete because it includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what is not present, as per the instructions.\n\n*   **Included**: It covers camera height, angle, focus, depth of field, movement type, steadiness, and the purpose of the movement.\n*   **Omitted (Correctly)**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so there is no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus is static, so there is no need to describe rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions are mentioned.\n\nBy omitting these details, the caption remains concise and focuses only on the defining characteristics of the shot.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of information into two clear, well-structured sentences without any fluff.\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology**: It uses the specified terms like \"eye-level,\" \"level-angle,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Describes Movement and Purpose**: It doesn't just state that the camera moves; it describes the quality of the movement (\"slight, natural unsteadiness\") and its narrative purpose (\"suggesting a walking perspective\").\n*   **Follows Negative Constraints**: It demonstrates a high-level understanding of the instructions by *not* mentioning the elements that were normal or absent (regular speed, no distortion, etc.), which is a key part of the conciseness requirement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to apply the detailed instructions to a video clip. It is precise, efficient, and demonstrates a full understanding of both the visual content and the descriptive requirements.",
