    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** This video is blurry, with dim lighting and hazy game effects, making it difficult to determine the focus type.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward and moving left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving leftward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the captioning process.\n\nHere is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good** and captures the most essential aspects of the video accurately and concisely. It successfully adheres to most of the instructions, particularly in describing the camera movement and the overall visual style. However, there is one minor inaccuracy regarding camera height that could be improved for perfect precision.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level... perspective\" is correct. The camera is not angled up or down at the subject but is parallel to the ground.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** \"smoothly moves backward and to the left, tracking a small figure from the side\" is a perfect description. It correctly identifies the dolly out, the truck left, the smoothness of the motion, and its purpose (tracking).\n    *   **Focus/Visuals:** \"The scene is dimly lit and blurry, with a hazy effect that obscures fine details\" is an excellent and accurate description of the focus and lighting. It correctly identifies that the entire scene is out of focus rather than having a shallow depth of field with a specific focus plane.\n\n*   **What could be improved:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The term **\"eye-level\"** is inaccurate. The camera is positioned very low to the ground, at the same height as the small, running figure. A more accurate description would be **\"low-level\"** or **\"hip-level.\"** \"Eye-level\" implies the perspective of a standing person, which this is not.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete and follows the instructions well by including relevant details while omitting unnecessary ones.\n\n*   **Included (Correctly):**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** `level`\n    *   **Camera Height:** `eye-level` (present, though inaccurate)\n    *   **Movement:** Type (`backward and to the left`, `tracking`), steadiness (`smoothly`), and purpose (`tracking a small figure`) are all covered.\n    *   **Focus:** The blurry, out-of-focus nature of the entire shot is well-described.\n\n*   **Omitted (Correctly, as per instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible distortion, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is not tilted, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** There are no focus shifts, so their omission is correct.\n\nThe caption successfully provides a comprehensive overview without getting bogged down in details that aren't present in the video.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is brief but packed with accurate information about the camera's configuration and movement.\n*   **Describing Movement:** The description of the compound movement (dolly, truck, and track) is clear and easy to understand.\n*   **Describing Focus:** It avoids technical terms like \"shallow depth of field\" because they don't apply. Instead, it uses descriptive language (\"blurry,\" \"hazy effect\") to explain the unconventional focus, which is a more effective approach for this video.\n*   **Omitting Negatives:** It correctly follows the rule not to mention regular speed, lack of distortion, or lack of a Dutch angle.\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback for 100% accuracy:\n\n**Revised Caption:** From a **low-level, level angle**, the camera smoothly moves backward and to the left, tracking a small figure from the side as it runs through a dark room. The entire scene is intentionally out-of-focus, creating a blurry and hazy effect that obscures all fine details.",
