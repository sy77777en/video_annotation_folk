    "pre_caption": "The video features smooth camera movements tracking a metallic object. Initially, the camera moves downward, then upward as the object ascends and hangs in midair. The camera then moves forward and backward to examine the object closely. In the second half, the shallow focus highlights the part of the object closer to the camera, leaving the farther part blurred. The background is black, making it difficult to determine the overall focus type.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** Due to the black background, it is difficult to determine the focus type in this video. However, in the second half of the video, the part of the subject closer to the camera appears sharp, while the farther part is more blurred. Therefore, it should be a shallow focus with the foreground in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the movement of the subject in the frame, first moving downward, then upward. As the object stops and hangs in midair, the camera moves forward and backward to examine it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good, high-level summary of the video's content. However, it lacks the technical specificity and detail required by the instructions. It uses general terms (\"moves downward,\" \"moves forward and backward\") where more precise cinematic terms are needed, and it misses some key descriptive elements.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   The description of the camera movements as \"smooth\" and \"tracking a metallic object\" is correct.\n    *   The initial \"downward, then upward\" movement is correctly identified.\n    *   The observation that the camera \"moves forward and backward\" is partially true, as dollying in and out does occur.\n    *   The description of the \"shallow focus\" in the second half is accurate and well-observed.\n    *   The note about the black background making it \"difficult to determine the overall focus type\" is an excellent and accurate analytical point.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Misleading:**\n    *   The primary camera movement is not just \"forward and backward.\" It's a complex **arc** around the object. Describing it this way is a significant oversimplification that misses the elegance of the shot.\n    *   The caption implies the shallow focus only appears \"in the second half,\" but it is present throughout the entire shot; it just becomes more pronounced as the camera gets closer and moves across the object's surface.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete according to the detailed instructions. It omits several key configuration details that are observable in the video.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption doesn't mention that the camera maintains a **level angle** relative to the object.\n    *   **Specific Movement Types:** It fails to use the precise terminology requested in the instructions. The \"downward/upward\" movement is a **pedestal**, the \"forward/backward\" movement is a **dolly**, and the main circular motion is an **arc**.\n    *   **Movement Complexity & Purpose:** It doesn't describe the combination of movements (e.g., arcing while dollying) or the purpose, which is to fluidly reveal the object's three-dimensional shape and texture.\n    *   **Steadiness:** While it says \"smooth,\" it could explicitly state the camera is **very steady**, implying a stabilizer or digital motion.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption follows some instructions but fails on the most important ones related to technical description.\n\n*   **Where it Adheres:**\n    *   It is relatively **concise**.\n    *   It correctly **omits** any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none are present. This follows the rule of not mentioning absent features.\n\n*   **Where it Deviates:**\n    *   It does not provide an \"informative description of the... camera's configuration\" to the level of detail required.\n    *   It fails to use the specific vocabulary for camera movements (**pedestaling, dollying, arcing**) that the instructions explicitly list.\n    *   The description of movement is not broken down in a clear temporal order with the correct terminology.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more closely follows the instructions:\n\n\"The video features a single, continuous shot with a very steady camera tracking a metallic object against a black background. The camera maintains a **level angle** throughout. It begins by **pedestaling down** and **dollying slightly forward**, then reverses to **pedestal up**. The camera then performs a smooth, slow **counter-clockwise arc** around the object while simultaneously **dollying in and out** to inspect its surface. A **shallow depth of field** is used, keeping the closest part of the object in sharp focus while the more distant parts are blurred.\"",
