    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at hip level, initially at a level angle, shifting to a high angle. It employs a shallow depth of field focused on the midground. The camera tilts down from the old woman's face to her wallet, then pans right and tilts up to follow the wallet, pausing briefly before tilting down again. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera initially focuses on the old woman's face, tilting down to shift focus to the wallet. It then follows the wallet by panning right and tilting up, pauses briefly, and tilts down again.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions precisely and effectively.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so good:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes all the specified camera and video properties:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** It correctly identifies the starting `hip level` and `level angle`, and astutely notes the shift to a `high angle` as the camera tilts down to look at the wallet. This shows a strong understanding of how camera movement affects the viewing angle.\n*   **Focus:** The description of a `shallow depth of field focused on the midground` is specific and correctly uses the terminology from the instructions.\n*   **Movement:** The sequence of movements is described with perfect accuracy and temporal order: `tilts down... then pans right and tilts up to follow... pausing briefly before tilting down again`. This is a clear and precise account of the camera's actions.\n*   **Steadiness:** The description `unsteady with noticeable shaking` accurately captures the quality of the handheld movement.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive, covering all the relevant aspects required by the instructions without including unnecessary information:\n*   It addresses **camera height, angle, focus (depth and plane), and movement (type, direction, steadiness, and purpose)**.\n*   By not mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, it correctly follows the instruction to omit these details when they are standard or absent, contributing to its conciseness.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect adherence to every rule in the prompt:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into just three sentences, fulfilling the core requirement.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses the exact terms requested, such as `hip level`, `level angle`, `high angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `midground`, `tilts`, and `pans`.\n*   **Temporal Order of Movement:** It clearly outlines the sequence of camera actions using words like \"initially,\" \"then,\" and \"before,\" as instructed.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** It explains *why* the camera moves (`to follow the wallet`), adding a layer of narrative context.\n\nIn summary, the caption is not just \"good\"—it is exemplary. It successfully translates a complex set of technical instructions into a clear, accurate, and concise description of the video's cinematography.",
