    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up and moving left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving leftward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** \"This is a smooth tracking shot that follows a tadpole-like creature from the side, moving left and up to keep it in the frame.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation**\n\nThe caption is a good starting point but is **not a good caption** because it fails to meet the detailed requirements of the instructions. It is accurate in its general description but lacks the required technical specificity and completeness.\n\n#### **1. Accuracy**\n\n*   **What it gets right:** The caption correctly identifies the primary camera action as a \"smooth tracking shot,\" the subject as a \"tadpole-like creature,\" the general camera position as \"from the side,\" and the direction of movement as \"left and up.\" The stated purpose, \"to keep it in the frame,\" is also accurate.\n\n#### **2. Completeness (Major Weakness)**\n\nThe caption is highly incomplete according to the instructions. It omits several mandatory descriptive elements:\n\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The instructions explicitly require a description of depth of field (deep, shallow), focus plane (foreground, midground, background), and any focus changes. A close-up shot of a small creature almost certainly has a noticeable depth of field (likely shallow), which is a critical part of its visual character.\n*   **Camera Angle and Height:** While \"from the side\" is descriptive, it does not use the specified terminology like *level angle*, *low angle*, etc.\n*   **Specific Movement Types:** \"Moving left and up\" is a simplification. The instructions ask for specific terms like *trucking* (moving sideways), *pedestaling* (moving vertically), or *tilting* (rotating vertically). The caption does not distinguish between these.\n\n#### **3. Adherence to Instructions**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which adheres to one part of the instructions. However, it achieves this by omitting required information rather than by efficiently combining it.\n*   **Technical Terminology:** It successfully uses \"tracking shot\" but fails to incorporate other key terms for angle, height, and specific movements as requested.\n*   **Omission of \"Normal\" Aspects:** It correctly omits mentions of video speed and lens distortion, assuming they are standard.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is too general and fails to provide the \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration\" that the instructions demand. It reads like a simple summary for a general audience, not the detailed technical breakdown that was requested.\n\n### **Example of a Better Caption**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that would be considered \"good\" according to the provided instructions:\n\n\"**This is a smooth tracking shot filmed at a level angle. The camera trucks left and tilts slightly upward to follow a tadpole-like creature, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the subject in sharp focus while blurring the background.**\"\n\nThis revised caption is better because it:\n1.  **Specifies the angle** (*level angle*).\n2.  **Uses precise movement terms** (*trucks left*, *tilts upward*).\n3.  **Includes the crucial details about focus** (*shallow depth of field*, *sharp subject*, *blurring the background*).\n4.  **Remains concise** while being far more informative and compliant with the instructions.",
