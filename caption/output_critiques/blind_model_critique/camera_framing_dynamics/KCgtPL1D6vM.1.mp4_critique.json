    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is very good and follows the instructions well, but there is one minor point of inaccuracy that could be improved.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is concise, informative, and correctly identifies the most important technical aspects of the shot while adhering to the instructions to omit default or non-existent features.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"This is a static shot...\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way.\n    *   **\"...level perspective.\"**: This is also accurate. The camera is not angled up or down; it is parallel to the ground, and the horizon is level.\n    *   **\"The camera uses a deep focus...\"**: This is correct. The depth of field is very large, rendering objects in the foreground (trams, people), midground (buildings across the street), and background (distant buildings) all in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"...keeping the entire street scene, from the trams to the buildings in the background, sharp and clear.\"**: This is an excellent and accurate elaboration of \"deep focus,\" providing specific examples from the video.\n\n*   **What Could Be More Accurate:**\n    *   **\"...filmed from an eye-level...\"**: This is a minor inaccuracy. The camera is positioned significantly higher than a person standing on the street. It appears to be filmed from a window or balcony of a building, likely on the second or third floor. A more accurate description for the camera height would be **elevated** or **second-story level**.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is very complete in the context of the instructions.\n*   It correctly identifies the shot as **static**, which sufficiently covers all aspects of camera movement (or lack thereof).\n*   It addresses **camera angle** (\"level perspective\") and **camera height** (\"eye-level,\" though slightly inaccurate).\n*   It thoroughly describes the **focus** (\"deep focus\") and the resulting effect on the image.\n*   It correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or a **Dutch angle**, as these are all standard or absent, following the instruction: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"*\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is perfectly concise, packing a lot of information into two clear sentences.\n*   **Informativeness:** It successfully describes the video's and camera's configuration as requested.\n*   **Following Negative Constraints:** The caption excels at following the instructions to leave out information about default settings (like regular speed and no distortion). This is a key part of the instructions that is often missed.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the correct terminology (static, level perspective, deep focus) as outlined in the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent and almost perfect. Its only flaw is the slightly inaccurate description of the camera height. By changing one word, it can be made fully accurate.\n\n**Suggested Improvement:**\n\nTo make the caption perfect, simply replace \"eye-level\" with \"elevated.\"\n\n**Revised (Ideal) Caption:**\n\"This is a static shot filmed from an **elevated**, level perspective. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene, from the trams to the buildings in the background, sharp and clear.\"",
