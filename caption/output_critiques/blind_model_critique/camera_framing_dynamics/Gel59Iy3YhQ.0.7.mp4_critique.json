    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the avatar from a side-view, intermittently moving downward as the avatar falls.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it captures the basic essence of the video, it is inaccurate in one key aspect and incomplete in several others, failing to adhere to the specific requirements of the prompt.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the content as a \"video game scene,\" the camera movement as \"smooth,\" the perspective as \"side-view,\" and the primary action as \"tracks the player's avatar.\"\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the downward movement as \"**intermittently**\" is incorrect. The camera moves **continuously** downward whenever the character is falling. It only stops moving when the character lands on a platform. \"Intermittent\" suggests the movement happens in sporadic, disconnected bursts, which is not the case. The movement is fluid and directly tied to the character's continuous fall.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is highly incomplete according to the instructions. It omits several key descriptive elements that are present in the video:\n\n*   **Camera Angle and Height:** It uses the general term \"side-view\" but fails to specify the more precise **level angle** as requested by the instructions.\n*   **Camera Movements:** It only mentions the downward movement. It completely misses the **horizontal tracking (trucking)** that occurs when the player moves the character left and right. The purpose of the movement (to keep the avatar centered) is also not stated.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The instructions explicitly ask to describe the focus. This video, being a 2D digital animation, **lacks realistic depth of field**. All visual layers (background, midground, foreground) are in sharp focus. This is a critical characteristic that should have been mentioned.\n*   **Shot Transitions:** The caption doesn't note that this is a single, continuous shot with no cuts, which is a relevant piece of information.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following ways:\n\n*   **Lack of Specific Terminology:** It uses the generic \"moving downward\" instead of the more technical term **pedestaling**, which is listed in the instructions. It also fails to mention **trucking** for the side-to-side movement.\n*   **Ignoring Key Categories:** It completely ignores the required sections on **Focus/Depth of Field** and provides an incomplete description of **Camera Movements**.\n*   **Oversimplification:** While the instructions ask for conciseness, this caption is oversimplified to the point of being incomplete and partially inaccurate. It sacrifices necessary detail for brevity.\n\n---\n\n### A Better Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the provided instructions:\n\n\"This is a single, continuous shot from a 2D video game. The camera maintains a **level angle** and tracks the player's avatar with perfectly smooth motion. It **pedestals down** to follow the character's fall and **trucks left and right** to match their horizontal movements, keeping the avatar centered in the frame. As a digital rendering, the scene has no realistic depth of field; all elements are in sharp focus.\"",
