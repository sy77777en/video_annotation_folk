    "pre_caption": "The video features an overhead camera at a high angle, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly tracks a car from above, trucking leftward while arcing counterclockwise around it. As the camera moves upward, the car becomes smaller in the frame, maintaining a steady and smooth motion throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks a car from an overhead angle, looking downward. While trucking leftward to follow the moving car, it arcs counterclockwise around the car and gradually moves upward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view while moving in an arc. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and provides a high-quality description of the video's technical aspects.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** The video features an overhead camera at a high angle, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly tracks a car from above, trucking leftward while arcing counterclockwise around it. As the camera moves upward, the car becomes smaller in the frame, maintaining a steady and smooth motion throughout.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The description of an \"overhead camera at a high angle\" is accurate. To be even more precise, this is a **bird's-eye view**, as the camera is looking almost perfectly straight down. However, \"overhead\" and \"high angle\" are perfectly understandable and correct.\n*   **Focus:** \"maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field\" is spot-on. The entire frame, from the car to the road texture, is sharp and clear.\n*   **Movement:** This is the strongest part of the caption. It correctly identifies and combines multiple complex movements:\n    *   **Tracking:** \"tracks a car from above\" - Correct.\n    *   **Trucking:** \"trucking leftward\" - Correct, the camera moves horizontally to the left to follow the car's path.\n    *   **Arcing:** \"arcing counterclockwise around it\" - Perfect. The perspective on the car rotates, which is a clear sign of an arcing motion.\n    *   **Craning/Pedestaling:** \"As the camera moves upward\" - Correct. The camera is clearly gaining altitude, which is a craning or pedestaling up motion.\n*   **Steadiness:** \"smoothly\" and \"steady and smooth motion\" accurately describe the flawless, stabilized movement.\n\n### 2. Completeness: Excellent\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary elements required by the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **Included:** Camera angle, height, movement (tracking, trucking, arcing, craning), steadiness, and focus are all covered.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible distortion, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon (implied by the road) is not tilted, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and efficient. It packs a significant amount of technical detail into two clear sentences without any filler words.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"tracks,\" \"trucking,\" \"arcing,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Structure:** The description flows logically, starting with the static camera properties (angle, focus) and then detailing the complex, continuous movement.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is an exemplary response to the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and highly concise. The description of the camera's compound movement (simultaneously tracking, trucking, arcing, and craning) is particularly impressive and demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography terms.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a bird's-eye view with an overhead camera maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera smoothly tracks a car from above, moving leftward while arcing counterclockwise around it.
