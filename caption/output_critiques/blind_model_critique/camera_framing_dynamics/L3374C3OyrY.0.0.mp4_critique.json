    "pre_caption": "This ground-level, level-angle shot smoothly arcs clockwise around a soccer ball. The camera, using a shallow depth of field to keep the ball in the foreground in sharp focus, pauses as a person's foot kicks the ball away.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera arcs clockwise around a soccer ball for a quarter-circle, then pauses as a person kicks the ball away.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption uses precise and accurate terminology to describe the visual events:\n*   **\"Ground-level, level-angle\"**: This correctly identifies the camera's position relative to the subject and the ground.\n*   **\"Smoothly arcs clockwise\"**: This perfectly describes the type, quality, and direction of the camera movement.\n*   **\"Shallow depth of field\"**: This accurately captures the focus effect, where the subject is sharp and the background is blurred.\n*   **\"Foreground in sharp focus\"**: This correctly identifies the focus plane.\n*   **\"Speed ramp effect, transitioning into slow motion\"**: This is a highly specific and correct description of the video speed alteration, pinpointing the exact technique used.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully incorporates all the relevant details requested in the instructions without being verbose:\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It covers height (`ground-level`), angle (`level-angle`), and focus (`shallow depth of field`, `foreground focus`).\n*   **Camera Movement**: It details the movement type (`arcing`), direction (`clockwise`), steadiness (`smoothly`), and temporal sequence (`arcs... pauses`).\n*   **Video Speed**: It clearly identifies the special speed effect (`speed ramp`, `slow motion`) and when it occurs (`at the moment of impact`).\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect understanding of the prompt's requirements:\n*   **Conciseness**: It avoids mentioning standard attributes like the absence of lens distortion or a Dutch angle, as instructed. It combines multiple descriptors into a fluid, easy-to-read sentence.\n*   **Temporal Order**: The description follows the sequence of events in the video logically: the initial arcing movement, the pause, and the final kick with the speed effect.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It uses the exact kind of descriptive language requested, such as \"arcs,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"speed ramp.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is exemplary because it is technically precise, comprehensive in its coverage of the required elements, and perfectly concise, fulfilling every aspect of the detailed instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This expertly crafted caption describes a ground-level, level-angle shot that smoothly arcs clockwise around a soccer ball. The camera employs a shallow depth of field to keep the ball in sharp focus in the foreground. As a person's foot kicks the ball away, the camera pauses, and the kick is highlighted with a speed ramp effect, transitioning into slow motion at the moment of impact.",
