    "pre_caption": "**Video and Camera Configuration Description:**\n\nThe camera begins at eye level, positioned above the waist, and then transitions to ground level. It maintains a high angle, looking down from above, and features a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The camera uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. Representing the player's perspective, the camera initially moves forward as the player attempts to walk behind a soldier. An explosion ahead throws the player backward, causing the camera to tilt upward and drop down. The camera then pans from right to left, suggesting the player is trying to stand up while leaning on one arm. Throughout, the camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the player's perspective. It initially moves forward as the player attempts to walk, but an explosion directly ahead throws the player backward, causing the camera to tilt upward and drop down. Finally, the camera pans from right to left, suggesting the player is trying to stand up, leaning on one arm for support.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a very good and largely accurate attempt to describe the complex camera work in the video. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the sequence of events, the change in height, the presence of a Dutch angle, and the overall unsteady nature of the movement. However, it contains a key inaccuracy regarding the camera angle and could be more precise with its terminology to better align with the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The description of the camera starting at eye-level and transitioning to ground-level is accurate.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The caption correctly identifies the presence of a Dutch angle and notes that it varies due to camera rolling, which is spot-on for the post-explosion sequence.\n    *   **Focus:** The description of \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is accurate. In this game engine, nearly all elements from the foreground (weapon) to the background are rendered in focus.\n    *   **Movement Sequence:** The narrative of the movement is correct: moving forward, being thrown back by an explosion, tilting up, dropping down, and then panning while on the ground.\n    *   **Steadiness:** Identifying the movement as \"slightly unsteady with some shaking\" is a perfect description of the first-person shaky-cam effect.\n    *   **Purpose:** The interpretation of the camera's movement (\"Representing the player's perspective,\" \"suggesting the player is trying to stand up\") is excellent and adds valuable context.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect or Needs Refinement:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The most significant inaccuracy is stating the camera \"**maintains a high angle**.\"\n        *   Initially, the camera is at a **level angle**, looking straight ahead from the player's point of view.\n        *   It only adopts a **high angle** *after* the player has fallen to the ground, at which point the camera is looking down at the ground from a low height. The caption fails to distinguish between these two distinct phases.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption covers most of the required elements but misses a few details or opportunities for more precise language as specified in the instructions.\n\n*   **Covered Elements:** Camera Height, Dutch Angle, Focus/Depth of Field, general Movements (translation, rotation), Steadiness, and Purpose.\n*   **Missing or Incomplete Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** As mentioned above, it misses the initial **level angle**.\n    *   **Specific Movement Terminology:** The instructions encourage using terms like *dolly, truck, pedestal, pan, tilt, roll*. While the caption uses *pan* and *tilt*, it could be more specific.\n        *   \"moves forward\" could be more precisely described as a **dolly forward**.\n        *   \"throws the player backward\" is a **rapid dolly backward**.\n        *   \"drop down\" is a **pedestal down** movement.\n    *   **Video Speed & Lens Distortion:** The caption correctly omits these as they are not present, which adheres to the instruction to be concise.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the spirit of the instructions well but could align more closely with the specific terminology requested.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and informative.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses some of the requested terms (pan, tilt, roll, deep focus) but could incorporate more (dolly, level angle) for a more technical and complete description.\n*   **Structure:** The description follows the temporal order of events, which is good. However, it blends the initial state and the post-explosion state in its description of the camera angle, which is confusing.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracies and incorporates more precise terminology from the instructions, making it a stronger and more complete description.\n\n**Video and Camera Configuration Description:**\n\nFrom a first-person perspective, the camera begins at eye-level with a **level angle** as it **dollies forward**. Following an explosion, the camera is thrown into a **rapid dolly backward** and a sharp **tilt upward** before its height **pedestals down** to ground-level. Now on the ground and at a **high angle** relative to the floor, the camera becomes unsteady, adopting a varying **Dutch angle** as it **rolls** and **pans** from right to left, simulating the disoriented character's struggle to get up. Throughout the video, a **deep focus** keeps the entire scene sharp.",
