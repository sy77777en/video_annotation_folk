    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video where time appears to move rapidly over an extended period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, mounted at the front of the car, moves with it, primarily moving forward along the road with occasional random trucking, panning, and brief pauses.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key aspects of the video, such as the time-lapse, deep focus, and the general nature of the movement. However, it contains some significant inaccuracies and omits important details required by the instructions, particularly regarding camera angle and lens distortion.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"The video is a time-lapse...\"**: **Accurate.** The rapid movement of clouds and other cars clearly indicates a time-lapse.\n*   **\"...with the camera at hip level...\"**: **Partially Accurate.** The camera is low, but \"hip level\" is an estimation. A more accurate description would be \"mounted low on the car, possibly on the dashboard or hood.\"\n*   **\"...maintaining a level angle...\"**: **Inaccurate.** This is the most significant error. A \"level angle\" means the camera is parallel to the ground, not pointing up or down. This camera is clearly positioned low and aimed slightly **upward**, which is a **low angle**. The caption confuses a level horizon (no Dutch angle) with a level camera angle.\n*   **\"...and deep focus.\"**: **Accurate.** Everything from the immediate foreground (car hood) to the distant background (buildings and sky) is in sharp focus.\n*   **\"It is mounted at the front of a car, moving quickly and smoothly forward along the road.\"**: **Accurate.** This correctly describes the primary setup and movement.\n*   **\"There are occasional random trucking and panning movements...\"**: **Partially Accurate.** The movements are indeed **trucking** (changing lanes) and **panning** (turning corners), but calling them \"random\" is incorrect. They are **purposeful**, dictated by the car following the road and navigating traffic.\n*   **\"...with brief pauses.\"**: **Accurate.** The car stops at traffic lights, resulting in pauses in the forward motion.\n\n#### 2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to include several key details that are present in the video and required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Lens Distortion**: **Omitted.** The video has very noticeable **barrel distortion**. Straight lines, such as buildings and lamp posts near the left and right edges of the frame, clearly bow outwards. The instructions explicitly state to describe this if present.\n*   **Camera Angle**: **Incorrectly described.** As mentioned above, the instruction asks for specific angle terminology (*high angle, low angle, etc.*). The caption uses \"level angle\" incorrectly instead of the correct term, **low angle**.\n*   **Movement Purpose**: **Omitted.** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement. The caption describes the trucking and panning as \"random\" instead of explaining their purpose, which is \"to follow the road\" or \"to navigate traffic.\"\n*   **Movement Complexity**: The description of the movement is a bit too simplistic. While it identifies the core components, it doesn't fully capture the continuous, complex path of a vehicle navigating a city.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the provided instructions:\n\n**This is a time-lapse video shot from a low angle with a camera mounted on the front of a car. The shot exhibits noticeable barrel distortion, causing vertical lines at the frame's edges to curve outwards. It maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves smoothly forward at high speed, combined with purposeful panning to navigate turns and trucking to change lanes, punctuated by brief pauses when the vehicle stops in traffic.**",
