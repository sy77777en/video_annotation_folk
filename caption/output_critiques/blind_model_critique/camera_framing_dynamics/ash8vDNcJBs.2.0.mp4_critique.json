    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera first performs a lead-tracking shot, moving backward to follow a group of soldiers running toward it. It then pans left to side-track the soldiers while trucking left to reveal more of the battlefield.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the front-side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the initial eye-level height, it could be more precise and descriptive based on the likely visual chaos of a battlefield scene. The term \"unsteady\" is vague; specifying the degree, such as \"moderate, jarring handheld shake,\" would better convey the intensity. The initial movement is more accurately a \"dolly out\" or \"pull-back shot\" rather than a \"lead-tracking shot,\" as the camera retreats from the approaching subjects. The subsequent pan and truck to the left could be enhanced by describing its speed and purpose—for instance, a \"swift pan-and-truck left\" that reveals an enemy machine-gun nest in the midground, which would also provide an opportunity to mention a potential \"rack focus\" from the soldiers to this new threat. Furthermore, the description omits key details that are plausible for this scenario: the video might incorporate a brief \"slow-motion\" segment as an explosion sends debris flying past the camera, and the use of a wide-angle lens could introduce slight \"barrel distortion\" at the edges of the frame. Finally, the camera height might not remain static; it could transition to a \"low angle\" as the operator crouches, adding to the sense of immersion and danger.",
