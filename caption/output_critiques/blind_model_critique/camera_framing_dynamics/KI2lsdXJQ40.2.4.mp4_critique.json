    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is concise, informative, and correctly identifies several key technical aspects of the video, such as the stop-motion technique, camera height, movement type, and depth of field. However, it contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the quality of the camera movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** It correctly identifies the video as **\"stop-motion,\"** which is evident from the discrete, frame-by-frame movement of the subject and the background.\n    *   **Camera Height:** **\"Eye-level\"** is an accurate description. The camera is positioned at the same height as the subject's head and shoulders.\n    *   **Movement Type & Direction:** It correctly identifies the movement as a **\"tracking shot that moves rightward, following a woman.\"** The camera moves parallel to the subject to keep her in the frame.\n    *   **Focus:** The description of a **\"shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in the foreground in sharp focus while the background remains blurred\"** is perfectly accurate.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **Movement Steadiness:** The caption describes the tracking shot as **\"smooth.\" This is inaccurate.** The movement has a distinct, consistent jitter or stutter. This is not a flaw but a characteristic artifact of the stop-motion technique, where the camera is physically moved in small increments between each frame. A truly smooth tracking shot would be fluid and seamless, which this is not.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is commendably complete for its length, covering the most critical elements as required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Elements Covered:** Video Speed, Camera Height, Movement (Type, Direction, Purpose), and Focus.\n*   **Elements Not Covered (but acceptable omissions):**\n    *   **Lens Distortion & Dutch Angle:** Correctly omitted, as none are present.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption uses \"eye-level\" (height) but doesn't explicitly state the angle is a **\"level angle.\"** However, \"eye-level\" strongly implies a level angle, so this omission is acceptable for conciseness.\n    *   **Movement Steadiness:** The caption attempts to describe steadiness but does so inaccurately (\"smooth\"). A complete description would correctly note the jittery nature of the movement.\n\nThe caption successfully prioritizes the most prominent features of the shot, making it effective and not overly cluttered. The main point of incompleteness is the lack of an *accurate* description of the movement's steadiness.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the core principles of the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It successfully balances these two goals, packing a significant amount of correct information into two sentences.\n*   **Describes Key Configurations:** It covers video speed, height, movement, and focus as requested.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** It correctly avoids mentioning the absence of lens distortion or a Dutch angle.\n*   **Describes Movement:** It correctly identifies the type and direction of movement. Its only failure in adherence is the inaccurate description of the movement's steadiness (\"smooth\" instead of jittery/stuttering).\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Examples\n\nHere are a few revised captions that correct the inaccuracy while maintaining conciseness and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Option 1 (Direct and Concise):**\n> This stop-motion video uses an eye-level tracking shot that moves rightward to follow a woman with glasses. The movement has a slight jitter characteristic of the animation style. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in sharp focus against a blurred background.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly more technical):**\n> This stop-motion video features a level-angle, eye-level tracking shot moving rightward. The movement has a characteristic stutter, and a shallow depth of field isolates the woman in the foreground by keeping her in focus while the background is blurred.\n\nBoth options replace the inaccurate word \"smooth\" with a more precise description of the movement's quality, making the caption fully accurate and compliant with the instructions.",
