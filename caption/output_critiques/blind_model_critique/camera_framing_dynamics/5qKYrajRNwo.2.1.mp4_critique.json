    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video where objects are moved frame by frame to create motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The video is a stop-motion animation with the camera positioned at eye level and a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the midground. The camera remains completely static throughout.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, complete according to the rules, and perfectly adheres to the instructions by being both informative and concise.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n#### 1. Accuracy:\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** It correctly identifies the video as a **\"stop-motion animation\"** due to the distinct, frame-by-frame movement of the clay figure.\n*   **Camera Configuration:**\n    *   **Height & Angle:** It accurately states the camera is at **\"eye level\"** relative to the subject and uses a **\"level angle,\"** as the camera is not looking up or down and the horizon is not tilted.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly identifies the **\"shallow depth of field\"** (the background is blurry while the subject is sharp) and the focus plane (**\"focusing on the man in the midground\"**).\n    *   **Movement:** It correctly notes that the **\"camera remains completely static,\"** as there is no panning, tilting, zooming, or any other movement of the frame.\n\n#### 2. Completeness:\nThe caption is perfectly complete. It includes all the necessary information for this specific video while correctly omitting details for features that are not present, as guided by the instructions.\n\n*   **Covered Elements:** It successfully describes video speed, camera angle, camera height, focus/depth of field, and camera movement.\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Lens Distortion & Dutch Angle:** The video has no noticeable lens distortion or Dutch angle. The instructions state, \"if the video... has no lens distortion... there is no need to mention these.\" The caption correctly follows this rule for conciseness.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot. Since no transitions occur, there is nothing to describe, and the caption correctly omits this.\n    *   **Complex Movements:** Since the camera is static, there is no need to detail different types of movement (panning, tilting, etc.), and the caption rightly simplifies this to \"completely static.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The primary instruction is to be \"concise yet informative.\" This caption is a model of that principle. It packs all the critical information into three clear, well-structured sentences without any filler.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"stop-motion,\" \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"static.\"\n*   **Clarity:** The description is unambiguous and easy to understand, leaving no room for misinterpretation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is an ideal response to the prompt. It demonstrates a perfect understanding of both the video's technical aspects and the specific requirements of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive without being verbose, and uses the correct technical language. No improvements are needed.",
