    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera remains static at first, then moves forward across the grass to reveal the valley. Afterward, it halts and transitions into a slow, intermittent pan to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies the main camera movements, the handheld nature of the shot, and the depth of field. However, it contains some key inaccuracies regarding camera height and angle, and it misses the opportunity to describe the transition in the camera's angle as instructed.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nHere is a breakdown of the caption's accuracy, statement by statement:\n\n*   **\"The camera is at eye level...\"** - **Inaccurate.** The camera is held much lower, closer to **hip-level or chest-level**. At the beginning of the shot, it's pointed slightly upward at the grass in front of the operator, a perspective that is inconsistent with an eye-level view.\n*   **\"...with a level angle...\"** - **Partially Inaccurate.** The shot *ends* with a level angle relative to the horizon, but it *begins* with a **low angle**, looking up from the ground toward the blades of grass. The caption fails to mention this initial angle and the subsequent tilt upwards.\n*   **\"...using deep focus.\"** - **Accurate.** Both the foreground grass and the distant valley/mountains are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"Initially static...\"** - **Slightly Inaccurate.** The camera is never truly static. From the very first frame, there is a slight, natural wobble characteristic of a handheld shot. A better description would be \"largely stationary\" before the main forward movement begins.\n*   **\"...the handheld camera moves forward across the grass to reveal the valley...\"** - **Accurate.** This correctly describes the primary motivation and direction of the first movement.\n*   **\"...then halts and slowly pans right.\"** - **Accurate.** The sequence of movement (forward motion -> stop -> pan) is described correctly.\n*   **\"The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\"** - **Accurate.** This correctly captures the handheld quality of the shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is reasonably complete but misses a few details specified in the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle Transition:** The instructions ask to note any shifts in camera angle. The caption misses the crucial transition from an initial **low angle** to a final **level angle** as the camera tilts up while moving forward.\n*   **Movement Terminology:** While \"moves forward\" is clear, the instructions provide more technical terms. Using **\"dollies forward\"** would be more precise and demonstrate a fuller understanding of the specified terminology.\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption provides a height (\"eye level\"), but it is incorrect. A more accurate description is missing.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully adheres to the instruction to be **concise** and to **omit irrelevant details** (like video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, which are not present).\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the **focus**, the **sequence of movements**, and the **steadiness**.\n*   It falls short on providing a fully \"informative description\" of the **camera's configuration** due to the inaccuracies in height and the omission of the angle transition, both of which are explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a hip-level height, the camera begins with a low angle. The unsteady, handheld camera dollies forward, tilting up to a level angle to reveal the valley. After halting, it performs a slow pan to the right. The shot maintains a deep focus throughout.\"**",
