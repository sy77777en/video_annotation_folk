    "pre_caption": "**Video and Camera Configuration Description:**\n\nThe camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene—such as people near the fence, strollers, and the background trees—sharp and clear. The camera moves forward throughout the video, advancing toward the people standing by the fence, and near the end, it slightly pans to the right. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some noticeable shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward throughout the entire video, with a slight pan to the right near the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The provided caption is very good—it is accurate, clear, and closely follows the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It successfully translates the visual information into a concise and accurate technical description, adhering to nearly all aspects of the detailed instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Height and Angle:** **Correct.** The description of the camera at \"eye level\" with a \"level angle\" is a perfect representation of the first-person perspective of someone walking.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** **Correct.** The video clearly exhibits \"deep focus,\" where elements from the midground (people, strollers) to the background (trees) are sharp. The examples provided in the caption are specific and accurate.\n*   **Camera Movement:** **Correct.** The caption accurately identifies the primary forward movement (\"moves forward...advancing toward the people\") and the secondary \"slight pan to the right\" near the end.\n*   **Steadiness:** **Correct.** The description of the movement as \"slightly unsteady, with some noticeable shaking\" accurately captures the natural motion of a handheld camera during walking.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete, covering all the relevant aspects present in the video.\n*   **Covered Elements:** It correctly describes camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, movement types (translation and rotation), and steadiness.\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):** Crucially, it follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present.\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no significant distortion, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there is no need to describe rack focus or tracking.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary words while remaining informative.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"pans\").\n*   **Structure:** The description is logically structured, first establishing the static properties of the camera (height, angle, focus) and then describing its dynamic properties (movement, steadiness).\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** It correctly includes the purpose of the movement (\"advancing toward the people standing by the fence\").\n\n### Minor Suggestions for Even Greater Precision\n\nThe caption is already excellent, but if you wanted to elevate it even further, you could add these minor details:\n\n1.  **Specify the Type of Unsteadiness:** Instead of just \"noticeable shaking,\" you could be more descriptive.\n    *   **Example:** \"The movement is unsteady, with a natural bobbing and swaying motion consistent with being handheld while walking.\"\n\n2.  **Specify the Speed of Movement:** The instructions mention describing speed. While it's implied, you could state it explicitly.\n    *   **Example:** \"The camera moves forward at a walking pace...\"\n\n### Revised Caption Incorporating Suggestions\n\nHere is how the caption would look with those minor improvements. This is not a correction, but an example of how to add even more detail.\n\n**Revised Example:**\n\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses deep focus, keeping all elements sharp, from the people at the fence to the background trees. The camera moves forward at a walking pace, advancing toward the people, and slightly pans right near the end. The movement is unsteady, with a natural bobbing motion consistent with being handheld while walking.\"",
