    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It then transitions to a high angle, looking down from above. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene. The motion involves a smooth tilt downward while panning from right to left, with the panning being faster than the tilting. The movement is steady with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts down while panning from right to left, with the panning motion noticeably faster than the tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. It contains significant inaccuracies and critical omissions that misrepresent the camera's configuration and movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its flaws:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly inaccurate in its description of the fundamental camera setup and movement.\n\n*   **Incorrect Starting Position:** The caption claims the video begins at \"eye level, looking straight ahead.\" This is false. The shot starts and remains at an **aerial-level** (high above the ground, likely from a drone) and at a **high angle** (looking down on the subject).\n*   **Incorrect \"Transition\":** The caption states, \"It then transitions to a high angle.\" There is no transition or cut in the video. It is a single, continuous shot that maintains a high angle throughout. This statement fabricates a change in camera setup that does not exist.\n*   **Partially Correct Movement:** While it correctly identifies a \"tilt downward\" and a \"pan from right to left,\" it misses the most significant camera movement.\n*   **Understated Steadiness:** The caption says the movement has \"minimal shaking.\" The shot is perfectly smooth and stable, characteristic of a professional gimbal on a drone. \"Very steady\" or \"perfectly steady\" would be more accurate.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption fails to describe the most important aspect of the camera's motion.\n\n*   **Missing Primary Movement (Dolly):** The most crucial omission is the camera's forward translational movement. The camera is **dollying forward** through the air, moving over the landscape. Describing only the pan and tilt completely fails to capture how the perspective is changing. The combination of the dolly, pan, and tilt creates the sweeping, cinematic feel of the shot.\n*   **Missing Height and Angle Description:** While it incorrectly mentions a transition *to* a high angle, it fails to state that the entire shot is from an **aerial-level** height and maintains a **high angle**.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to follow the core requirements of providing an informative and accurate description of the camera's configuration.\n\n*   **Fails to Describe Configuration Accurately:** The instructions ask for a description of camera height and angle, but the caption provides incorrect information for both.\n*   **Fails to Describe Movements Completely:** The instructions list multiple types of movement (dollying, trucking, etc.). The caption omits the primary \"dolly\" movement, which is essential for understanding the shot.\n*   **Invents a Shot Transition:** The instructions specify how to handle shot transitions *if they occur*. By inventing a transition, the caption misapplies this rule and creates a false narrative of the video's structure.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a good caption that accurately follows the instructions:\n\n**This aerial-level, high-angle shot features a very steady and continuous camera movement. The camera simultaneously dollies forward, pans left, and tilts down to follow the dramatic coastline. The shot maintains deep focus, ensuring the cliffs, beach, and ocean are all sharp and clear throughout.**",
