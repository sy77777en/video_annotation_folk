    "pre_caption": "This is a slightly unsteady, static shot from a low angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is highly accurate, concise, and adheres well to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, static shot\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera's position is fixed (static), but there is a very subtle, high-frequency vibration or wobble, making it \"slightly unsteady\" rather than perfectly stable.\n*   **\"from a low angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned below the subject's waist and looks upward, making the person appear taller and more prominent against the sky.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: This is also accurate. The wooden planks in the immediate foreground, the person in the midground, and the clouds in the background are all in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions: Very Good**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is brief and to the point, successfully avoiding unnecessary information as instructed (e.g., it correctly omits any mention of normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, or the absence of a Dutch angle).\n*   **Required Elements:**\n    *   **Movement & Steadiness:** Correctly identified as \"static\" and \"slightly unsteady.\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Correctly identified as \"low angle.\"\n    *   **Focus:** Correctly identified as \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Minor Omission for Improvement:** The instructions ask for **camera height** in addition to angle. While \"low angle\" implies a low height, a more complete description would specify that it is a **ground-level** shot, as the camera is placed directly on or just inches above the boardwalk.\n\n### Revised Caption for Maximum Completeness\n\nTo be perfectly aligned with every detail in the instructions, the caption could be slightly modified:\n\n\"This is a slightly unsteady, static, **ground-level** shot from a **low angle**. The camera uses a **deep focus**, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** The original caption is excellent. It accurately captures the most critical visual characteristics of the shot in a concise manner. The addition of \"ground-level\" would make it even more precise, but its absence is a very minor point. The caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the video and the instructions.",
