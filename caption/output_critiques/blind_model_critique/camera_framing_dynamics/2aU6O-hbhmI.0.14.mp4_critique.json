    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is at an aerial level, transitioning from a 90-degree rotated angle to a high angle, then back to a level angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone executes skilled, complex maneuvers, diving downward before leveling its view, with pronounced rolling movements. The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle transitions from a 90-degree rotated level angle to a high angle, and then back to a level angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone performs skilled, complex maneuvers, diving downward before leveling its view, accompanied by pronounced rolling movements.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good** and accurately captures the most significant visual and technical aspects of the video. It successfully identifies the key characteristics like the fisheye lens, the complex drone movement, and the deep focus. However, it could be improved by using more precise, standard terminology as outlined in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Fisheye Distortion:** **Accurate.** The caption correctly identifies the \"noticeable fisheye distortion\" and its effect of \"curving straight lines outward.\" This is a dominant feature of the video, caused by the wide-angle lens typical of FPV (First-Person View) drones.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** **Mostly Accurate, but with Imprecise Terminology.**\n    *   \"aerial level\" is **accurate**.\n    *   \"transitioning from a 90-degree rotated angle to a high angle, then back to a level angle\" is conceptually correct but uses non-standard phrasing. The term \"90-degree rotated angle\" is an attempt to describe a **bird's-eye view** (looking straight down at 90 degrees). The instructions specifically list \"bird's eye\" as the correct term. The subsequent transition to a \"high angle\" and then a \"level angle\" is an accurate description of the camera's change in pitch as it dives and levels out.\n*   **Focus:** **Accurate.** The video does maintain \"deep focus with a large depth of field,\" keeping both the nearby structures and the distant background sharp.\n*   **Movement:** **Accurate.** The description of the drone's movement as \"skilled, complex maneuvers, diving downward before leveling its view, with pronounced rolling movements\" is excellent. It captures the essence of the FPV flight style. The observation that the movement is \"very smooth, with no shaking\" is also correct.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is quite complete and covers the most critical elements requested in the instructions:\n*   **Covered:** Lens Distortion, Camera Height, Camera Angle (and its changes), Focus/Depth of Field, and Movement (type, complexity, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   **Not Mentioned (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is in real-time, so omitting this follows the instruction to only mention altered speed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** While the camera rolls significantly, this is a dynamic movement, not a static tilted horizon (Dutch angle). The caption correctly describes this as \"rolling movements\" instead.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\nThe description of movement could have been slightly more technical by mentioning the continuous **forward dolly** (the drone is always moving forward), but \"diving\" is a more descriptive and effective term for the primary action.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and effective. It avoids unnecessary jargon and combines related concepts into smooth sentences.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** This is the main area for improvement. The caption fails to use the specific term **\"bird's-eye view\"** provided in the instructions, opting for the less clear \"90-degree rotated angle.\" Using the standard term would make the description more professional and universally understood.\n*   **Structure:** The caption is well-structured, grouping related attributes together (e.g., distortion, then position/angle, then focus, then movement).\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to the provided terminology.\n\n**\"The video is defined by noticeable fisheye distortion. From an aerial level, the camera begins with a bird's-eye view before executing a complex and smooth maneuver: it dives downward while performing pronounced rolls, tilting up to transition through a high angle to a level angle. The shot maintains deep focus throughout.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n*   **Uses Standard Terminology:** Replaces \"90-degree rotated angle\" with the correct term \"bird's-eye view.\"\n*   **Improves Flow:** It describes the movement as a single, complex sequence, which better reflects the continuous nature of the shot.\n*   **Maintains Conciseness:** It is just as concise while being more technically precise.",
