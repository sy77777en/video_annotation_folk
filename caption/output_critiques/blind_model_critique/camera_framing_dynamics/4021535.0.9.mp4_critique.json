    "pre_caption": "This is an intensely shaky, stationary shot from a high, ground-level angle. The camera repeatedly attempts to focus on a group of ants moving sugar-like objects, causing the image to shift back and forth between shallow focus and being completely out of focus. Halfway through the video, the camera slightly zooms out before returning to its original position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows a group of ants moving what appears to be white sugar-like objects. The camera repeatedly tries to focus clearly, causing the scene to shift back and forth between shallow focus and out of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains stationary with intense shaking. Halfway through the video, it slightly zooms out before returning to its original stationary state with intense shaking for the remainder of the shot.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption captures the core chaotic feeling of the shot, it could be more precise and technically descriptive. The phrase \"high, ground-level angle\" is contradictory; a more accurate description would be that the shot is filmed from a **ground-level height** with a **high-angle** perspective, looking down on the ants. The description of the shakiness is general; it would be stronger to specify that the **handheld camera suffers from severe, high-frequency shaking and erratic micro-movements**, suggesting the operator is struggling to hold it steady so close to the ground. The caption correctly identifies the focus issues, but could use the more technical term **\"focus hunting\"** to describe the camera's repeated, failed attempts to lock onto the subjects. The description of the mid-video action is slightly inaccurate. Rather than the zoom-out itself blurring the frame, the video I see shows a slight, unsteady **dolly-out movement** (the operator pulling the camera back), which is immediately followed by a deliberate **manual rack focus**. This focus pull is not just a general shift; it specifically transitions from a completely blurred image to a very **shallow depth of field**, rendering a single line of ants in the midground tack-sharp while the cracked pavement in the immediate foreground and the other ants in the background remain heavily blurred, finally giving the viewer a clear subject to observe.",
