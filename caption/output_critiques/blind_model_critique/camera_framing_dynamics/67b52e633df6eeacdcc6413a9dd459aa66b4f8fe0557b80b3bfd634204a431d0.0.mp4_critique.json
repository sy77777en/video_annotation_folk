    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the video's technical aspects but contains significant inaccuracies that misrepresent the camera's configuration and movement.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the use of **deep focus** (or at least a deep depth of field) and the **steady, fluid motion** of the camera. It also correctly identifies the movement as an **arc**.\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The phrase \"high-angle view from eye level\" is a contradiction. A **high angle** means the camera is positioned *above* the subject's eye line, looking down. **Eye-level** means the camera is at the same height as the subject's eyes. The video is clearly shot from a **high angle**, not at eye level.\n    *   **Movement Direction:** The camera moves from right to left around the subjects, which is a **counter-clockwise** arc. The caption incorrectly states the movement is \"clockwise.\"\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Good:** The caption successfully covers several key points required by the instructions: camera angle, focus, and camera movement (type, steadiness).\n*   **Good:** It correctly adheres to the conciseness rule by omitting any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none of these are present or altered.\n*   **Could be Improved:** While \"smoothly\" implies a certain speed, explicitly stating that the arc is **slow** would add more detail without sacrificing conciseness.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by providing a description of the camera's configuration and movement. However, the factual errors in describing the height and direction of movement mean it fails to provide an accurate description as required.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**No, the caption is not good.** While it follows the general format requested, its core factual errors about the camera's height and direction of movement make it a poor and misleading description of the video.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption:\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\n\"From a high angle, the camera performs a slow, smooth **counter-clockwise arc** around two women on beach chairs. A deep depth of field keeps the subjects and their immediate surroundings in sharp focus.\"",
