    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant error regarding camera movement, making it an incomplete and misleading description of the video. While it correctly identifies the angle and focus, it fails to describe the most prominent action: the camera's forward motion.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"level camera angle\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned parallel to the ground, not pointing up or down.\n    *   **\"deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field\"**: Correct. Both the cars in the midground and the buildings in the background are in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"slightly unsteady\"**: Correct. There is a noticeable, low-level vibration consistent with a camera inside a moving vehicle.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"The camera is fixed\"**: This is **incorrect**. A fixed camera does not change its position in space (like a camera on a tripod). In this video, the camera is clearly moving forward through the environment as the car drives. The correct term for this movement is a **dolly forward**.\n    *   **\"with no intentional movement\"**: This is also **incorrect**. The forward dolly is the primary and most intentional movement of the shot, designed to give the viewer the perspective of driving. The caption writer likely confused the lack of *rotational* movement (panning/tilting) with a complete lack of movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and misses key information required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Movement**: The caption fails entirely to describe the primary **dolly forward** movement. This is the most significant omission.\n*   **Camera Height**: The caption does not specify the camera height. Based on the perspective, it should be described as **eye-level** (from a seated position).\n*   **Purpose of Movement**: While it mentions \"no intentional movement,\" it misses the clear purpose, which is to capture a **driver's point-of-view (POV)**.\n\nThe caption correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., video speed alteration, lens distortion, Dutch angle), which aligns with the instruction for conciseness.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption attempts to be concise, which is good.\n*   It uses some of the specified terminology (\"level camera angle,\" \"deep focus\").\n*   However, it fails the core instruction to provide an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration,\" specifically regarding **movements (translation)**. By mislabeling the shot as \"fixed,\" it fundamentally misrepresents the camera's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**The eye-level camera dollies forward at a consistent speed, capturing a driver's point-of-view. The shot is slightly unsteady due to road vibrations and maintains deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp.**",
