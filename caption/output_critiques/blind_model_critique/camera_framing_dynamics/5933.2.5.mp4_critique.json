    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down at a person sketching in a notebook. The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground where the drawing is being made. The camera motion is quite unsteady and lacks a clear pattern, adding a dynamic feel to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good starting point, but it misses several key details and contains some ambiguities. The description of \"eye-level height with a high angle\" is confusing; the video is actually shot from a high angle, positioned almost directly over the artist's shoulder, creating a perspective that is closer to overhead-level relative to the notebook. A significant omission is the video's speed, as the entire sketching process is shown in fast-motion, condensing several minutes of drawing into a much shorter clip. While the caption correctly identifies the extremely shallow depth of field, it could be more precise by stating that the focus is not just on the midground but actively tracks the tip of the pencil, ensuring the lines being drawn are always the sharpest element while the artist's hand in the foreground and the textured paper in the background are softly blurred. The description of the camera motion as \"unsteady and lacks a clear pattern\" is an oversimplification; the camera is handheld, but its movement consists of deliberate, subtle drifts and micro-pans that follow the drawing action, rather than being randomly shaky. For example, it makes a slow, short trucking motion to the right as the artist fills in a section on that side of the page, which is a purposeful, not patternless, movement.",
