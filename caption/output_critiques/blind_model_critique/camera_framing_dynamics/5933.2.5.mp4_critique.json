    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great request for detailed analysis. Here is a thorough breakdown of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies several key cinematic features of the video, such as the angle, depth of field, and camera instability. However, it has a minor inaccuracy regarding camera height and could be slightly more precise in its language to fully adhere to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"The video is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle...\"**: This is partially correct but also contradictory.\n    *   **High Angle:** **Correct.** The camera is clearly positioned above the notebook and looking down, which defines a high angle.\n    *   **Eye-level height:** **Inaccurate/Misleading.** \"Eye-level\" typically refers to the camera being at the same height as a subject's eyes, creating a neutral perspective. In this shot, the camera is held by a person who is likely sitting or leaning over a table. While it might be at *their* eye level, the term is confusing in this context because the angle is high relative to the subject (the notebook). It's better to omit \"eye-level\" and just state the angle, or describe the height more generally (e.g., \"shoulder-level\").\n\n*   **\"...looking down at a person sketching in a notebook.\"**: **Correct.** This accurately describes the content.\n\n*   **\"The camera employs an extremely shallow depth of field...\"**: **Correct.** The background is heavily blurred (strong bokeh), indicating a very wide aperture and thus an extremely shallow depth of field.\n\n*   **\"...focusing on the midground where the drawing is being made.\"**: **Correct.** The plane of focus is precisely on the notebook and the artist's hand, which occupy the midground of the frame.\n\n*   **\"The camera motion is quite unsteady and lacks a clear pattern...\"**: **Correct.** The camera is clearly handheld, resulting in constant, small, and non-deliberate movements (a natural wobble). \"Unsteady\" and \"lacks a clear pattern\" are excellent descriptors for this type of movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption does a good job of being concise by omitting elements that are not present, as per the instructions.\n\n*   **What it correctly includes:** Camera angle, depth of field, focus plane, and a description of the camera's unsteady movement.\n*   **What it correctly omits (following the conciseness rule):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible distortion, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus remains fixed on the midground, so there is no rack focus or focus tracking to describe.\n\nThe caption successfully covers the most important and noticeable cinematic features of the shot while correctly ignoring the \"normal\" or absent ones.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions but could be improved.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It is both. It packs a good amount of information into three sentences.\n*   **Configuration Coverage:** It covers angle, height (though inaccurately), movement, and focus.\n*   **Clarity on Movement:** It describes the steadiness (\"unsteady\") and complexity (\"lacks a clear pattern\") well. It doesn't specify the type (e.g., minor trucking and pedestaling from the handheld motion), but for such subtle movement, the general description is sufficient and follows the spirit of the instruction to \"summarize it concisely\" if it's fragmented or random.\n*   **Clarity on Focus:** The description of the depth of field and focus plane is excellent and follows the instructions perfectly.\n\nThe main point of non-adherence is the inaccurate combination of \"eye-level height\" and \"high angle.\"\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and fully aligned with the instructions:\n\n**\"This high-angle shot uses an extremely shallow depth of field to isolate the notebook in the midground. The camera is handheld and unsteady, exhibiting slight, continuous movement without a clear directional pattern, which creates an intimate, observational feel.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **More Accurate Height/Angle:** It removes the confusing \"eye-level\" term and leads with the most dominant characteristic: the \"high angle.\"\n*   **More Precise Language:** It uses \"isolate\" to describe the effect of the shallow depth of field, which is very fitting.\n*   **Improved Movement Description:** It specifies the movement is \"slight\" and \"continuous,\" adding a layer of detail while remaining concise. It also includes the purpose (\"creates an intimate, observational feel\"), as suggested in the instructions.",
