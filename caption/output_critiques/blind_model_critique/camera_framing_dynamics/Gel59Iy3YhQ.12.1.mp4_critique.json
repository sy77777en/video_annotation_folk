    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, first-person perspective, the smooth camera performs seemingly random exploratory movements, mimicking how a person might look around a room. It begins with a slight upward tilt, then pans left. Following this, it tilts down, shifting to a high-angle view, before panning back to the right. The scene starts out of focus and gradually transitions to deep focus, bringing the entire room into clarity by the end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video begins out of focus and transitions to deep focus by the end.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the player's perspective, performing seemingly random motions as if exploring the room. It begins with a slight tilt upward, followed by a pan to the left. After panning, it tilts down slightly before panning to the right, mimicking the natural, unstructured way someone might look around.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is a high-quality and accurate description of the video, demonstrating a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Perspective and Height:** The description of an \"eye-level, first-person perspective\" is spot-on. The camera's height and movement style perfectly mimic a person standing and looking around.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The sequence of movements is described with perfect accuracy: a slight upward tilt, a pan left, a downward tilt (correctly identified as creating a \"high-angle view\"), and a final pan right. The characterization of the movement as \"smooth\" and \"exploratory\" is also very fitting.\n*   **Focus:** The analysis of the focus is precise. The video begins completely out of focus and performs a slow focus pull until the entire scene is sharp, which is correctly identified as \"deep focus.\"\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary elements specified in the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **Included:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"eye-level\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"high-angle view\"\n    *   **Movements:** \"upward tilt,\" \"pans left,\" \"tilts down,\" \"panning back to the right.\" The steadiness (\"smooth\"), purpose (\"exploratory\"), and complexity (described sequentially) are all covered.\n    *   **Focus:** The initial state (\"out of focus\"), the change (\"gradually transitions\"), and the final state (\"deep focus\") are all clearly explained.\n\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention was needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention was needed.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there were no transitions to describe.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise yet packed with information. It avoids unnecessary words while providing a comprehensive overview.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms (\"tilt,\" \"pan,\" \"high-angle,\" \"deep focus\") as requested.\n*   **Structure:** It logically describes the camera's configuration, its sequence of movements, and the dynamic change in focus, making it easy to follow. The description of the movement's purpose (\"mimicking how a person might look around a room\") adds valuable context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is exceptionally well-written. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to all aspects of the detailed instructions. It demonstrates a thorough analysis of the video's technical and stylistic elements and communicates them clearly and concisely. No improvements are necessary.",
