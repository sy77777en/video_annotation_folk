    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The first-person camera moves forward to approach the stairs and then climbs up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is good, but it contains one key inaccuracy and a few minor omissions when measured against the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is **good but flawed**. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, such as the first-person perspective, camera height, and deep focus. However, it incorrectly describes the camera angle as consistently level and omits a crucial camera movement (the tilt).\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"first-person camera at eye level\"**: Correct. The perspective is clearly from a person's point of view at a natural height.\n    *   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. The handrail in the foreground, the stairs in the midground, and the wall at the top are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"smoothly moves forward\"**: Correct. The camera's initial movement is a smooth forward dolly/track.\n    *   **\"ascends them with minimal shaking\"**: Correct. The camera moves vertically up the stairs, and the movement is very stable.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"maintaining a level angle\"**: This is the most significant error. The camera **tilts upward** to look up the stairs just before it begins to ascend. By stating the angle is maintained as level, the caption misses a key, purposeful camera rotation.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Upward Tilt:** The instructions explicitly ask to describe rotational movements like tilting. The upward tilt is a deliberate action to reframe the shot for the ascent and is the most important missing detail.\n    *   **Subtle Panning:** While minor, the camera makes very slight panning movements to the left and right as it moves forward, simulating a person's natural head movement. The instructions ask for a description of rotation, and this detail would make the caption more complete.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n*   **What Adheres Well:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or **Dutch angle**, as these are all standard/absent. This follows the instruction to not mention them if they are not noteworthy.\n    *   **Clarity:** The description of movement (\"moves forward,\" \"ascends them\") is clear and easy to understand.\n\n*   **Where Adherence is Lacking:**\n    *   **Movement Description:** The instructions require a full description of movements, including **rotation (panning, tilting)**. The caption fails to describe the upward tilt, which is a primary camera action in this video.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and complete according to your instructions:\n\n**The video is shot from a first-person perspective at eye-level with deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves smoothly forward, tilting up as it approaches a set of stairs, and then ascends them with minimal shaking.**",
