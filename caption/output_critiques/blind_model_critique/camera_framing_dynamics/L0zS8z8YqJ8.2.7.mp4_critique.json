    "pre_caption": "This video features a dynamic and smooth camera movement. The shot begins from an overhead, high-angle perspective outside the train. The camera then moves quickly backward while simultaneously shifting right and panning left, smoothly entering the train's cabin. As it moves inside, the camera's perspective transitions to a level angle, capturing the interior from the front. A deep focus is maintained throughout the shot, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward while shifting right and panning left, entering the train’s cabin and filming the interior from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate in its descriptions, mostly complete, and largely adheres to the instructions. It successfully captures the most prominent aspects of the shot (the complex movement and deep focus) in a concise manner. However, it misses one key camera movement and could use slightly more precise terminology as outlined in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n\n*   **\"dynamic and smooth camera movement\"**: Correct. The movement is both complex and perfectly stabilized.\n*   **\"begins from an overhead, high-angle perspective\"**: Correct. The camera starts high above the tracks, looking down.\n*   **\"moves quickly backward while simultaneously shifting right and panning left\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the primary horizontal and rotational movements. The camera pulls back from the train (backward), moves toward the right side of the frame (shifting right), and rotates its view to the left to keep the cabin centered.\n*   **\"transitions to a level angle\"**: Correct. Once inside the cabin, the camera is no longer looking down but is level with the interior.\n*   **\"A deep focus is maintained throughout the shot\"**: Correct. Both the foreground (cabin interior) and background (tracks outside) are sharp, indicating a deep depth of field.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses one crucial element of the camera's movement.\n\n*   **What's Missing:** The caption fails to mention the **vertical downward movement**. The camera starts at an \"overhead\" height and must move **down** to enter the window at what becomes \"eye-level.\" This is a **pedestal down** or **crane down** movement, and it's a significant part of the shot's complexity.\n*   **What's Included Well:** It correctly covers the starting angle/height, the primary movements (translation and rotation), the ending angle, and the focus. It also correctly omits non-notable features like video speed and lens distortion, adhering to the conciseness instruction.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the instructions but could be slightly more precise with its terminology.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Terminology:** It correctly uses key terms from the instructions like **\"high-angle,\" \"level angle,\" \"panning,\"** and **\"deep focus.\"**\n    *   **Conciseness:** It provides an informative description without unnecessary words, as requested.\n    *   **Structure:** It describes the camera's configuration in a logical, temporal order.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Movement Terminology:** The instruction provides specific terms like \"trucking\" (moving left/right). While \"shifting right\" is understandable, **\"trucking right\"** would be more technically adherent.\n    *   **Missing Movement Type:** As noted in the completeness section, it omits the **\"pedestaling\"** or **\"craning\"** down movement, which are terms explicitly listed in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback to be more complete and technically precise, while remaining concise.\n\n**\"This single, steady shot begins at a high angle outside the train. The camera executes a smooth, complex movement—simultaneously dollying backward, trucking right, and craning down while panning left—to seamlessly enter the cabin through the front window. The perspective transitions to a level angle at eye-level inside. Deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the shot.\"**\n\n**Why this version is an improvement:**\n\n*   **Adds the Missing Movement:** It includes **\"craning down\"** to account for the essential vertical motion.\n*   **Uses More Precise Terminology:** It replaces \"moves backward\" and \"shifting right\" with the more technical **\"dollying backward\"** and **\"trucking right.\"**\n*   **Adds Steadiness:** It explicitly mentions the shot is **\"steady,\"** another detail requested in the instructions.\n*   **Maintains Conciseness:** It integrates these details without becoming overly long or difficult to read.",
