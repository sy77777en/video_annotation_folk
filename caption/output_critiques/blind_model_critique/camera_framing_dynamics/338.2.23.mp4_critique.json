    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera smoothly moves downward and forward while simultaneously trucking left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption attempts to follow the instructions but contains significant inaccuracies regarding key camera and lens properties. While it correctly identifies the general direction and smoothness of the movement, it mischaracterizes the camera's starting position, angle, and, most importantly, the depth of field.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Movement Direction:** The description of the camera moving \"downward and forward while simultaneously trucking left\" is accurate.\n    *   **Movement Quality:** The terms \"smoothly\" and \"steady with minimal shaking\" are correct. The shot is exceptionally stable, likely achieved with a gimbal or crane.\n    *   **Subject of Focus:** The statement that it is \"focusing on the group of people seated at the table\" correctly identifies the subject.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The caption states the camera is at \"eye level\" and maintains a \"level angle.\" This is incorrect. The shot **begins** from a **high position** with a **high angle** looking down on the scene. It then moves downward, ending closer to the eye level of the seated subjects, transitioning to a more **level angle**. The height and angle are dynamic, not static.\n    *   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption claims the video has \"deep focus and a large depth of field.\" This is the most significant error. The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**. The background (the bar, other patrons, and lights) is intentionally and heavily blurred (bokeh), while only the subjects at the table (the midground) are in sharp focus. Deep focus would mean both the background and foreground are sharp.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but misses key details and uses less precise terminology than the instructions encourage.\n\n*   **Movement Terminology:** While \"moves downward\" is understandable, a more precise term from the instructions would be **craning down** or **pedestaling down**. Given the smooth, arcing nature of the descent, **craning down** is the most appropriate description. Similarly, \"moves forward\" could be more precisely described as **dollying forward**.\n*   **Dynamic Changes:** The caption fails to describe the *transition* of the camera's height and angle. A complete description would note that it moves from a high position to a lower one and the angle changes from high to level.\n*   **Focus Plane:** The caption correctly identifies the subjects but doesn't specify the **focus plane** (midground) as suggested by the instructions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise and to omit details about normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and lack of a Dutch angle.\n*   However, it fails to accurately apply the core concepts it was asked to describe (camera angle, height, and depth of field). It uses the wrong terminology (\"deep focus\") and describes dynamic properties (height, angle) as if they were static.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**Starting from a high angle, the camera performs a smooth, steady compound movement, simultaneously craning down, dollying forward, and trucking left to approach a table. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the group of people in the midground in sharp focus while the background remains blurred. As the camera moves, its angle transitions from high to a more level perspective on the subjects.**",
