    "pre_caption": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the handheld camera follows a man from behind as he moves toward a helicopter. As the camera tracks forward, the man grows larger in the frame. The camera then becomes stationary, with continued handheld shaking, as he boards the helicopter. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera moves forward to follow a man running toward a helicopter. It then becomes stationary with noticeable handheld shaking as he boards the helicopter.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively and accurately describes the video's and camera's configuration according to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Movement:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the camera as \"handheld\" and \"unsteady,\" which explains the shaking. It accurately breaks the shot into two phases: first, \"follows a man from behind as he moves\" (tracking), and second, \"becomes stationary.\"\n*   **Perspective:** \"Eye-level perspective\" is an accurate description of the camera height.\n*   **Focus:** The identification of \"deep focus\" and the explanation that it \"keep[s] the entire scene sharp\" is precise.\n*   **Framing:** The observation that \"the man grows larger in the frame\" is an accurate consequence of the camera tracking forward and getting closer to the subject.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes the necessary elements while omitting those that are not present, as instructed.\n*   **Camera Height & Steadiness:** It clearly states the camera is at \"eye-level\" and is \"unsteady\" and \"handheld.\"\n*   **Camera Movement:** It describes the primary movements (tracking forward, then becoming stationary) and their purpose (to follow the man).\n*   **Focus:** It correctly specifies the \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Omissions:** By not mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, the caption correctly implies these are standard or absent, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a great example of being both. It packs a significant amount of technical detail into three clear sentences without being overly verbose.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses appropriate terminology from the instructions, such as \"tracks,\" \"handheld,\" \"stationary,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Structure:** It logically describes the sequence of events in temporal order, which is exactly what the instructions requested for complex movements.\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Improvement\nWhile the caption is excellent, one very minor refinement could make it even more aligned with the instructions:\n*   The phrase \"the man grows larger in the frame\" describes the *result* of the movement. The caption could be made slightly more direct by focusing only on the camera's action. For example: \"The handheld camera tracks forward, following a man from behind...\" This is a minor point, as the current phrasing is still clear and accurate.\n*   It could explicitly mention the **camera angle** (e.g., \"level angle\") in addition to the height (\"eye-level\") for maximum completeness, but \"eye-level perspective\" strongly implies a level angle.\n\nOverall, the caption is a high-quality example that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and well-structured.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The handheld camera, at an eye-level and level angle, follows a man from behind as he moves toward a helicopter. As the camera tracks forward, it gets closer to the man. The camera then becomes stationary, maintaining its handheld unsteadiness, as the man boards the helicopter. The shot uses deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
