    "pre_caption": "From an unsteady, eye-level perspective, the handheld camera follows a man from behind as he moves toward a helicopter. As the camera tracks forward, the man grows larger in the frame. The camera then becomes stationary, with continued handheld shaking, as he boards the helicopter. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera moves forward to follow a man running toward a helicopter. It then becomes stationary with noticeable handheld shaking as he boards the helicopter.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic action and handheld nature of the shot, it could be more precise and evocative. The term \"tracks forward\" is somewhat ambiguous for a handheld shot; a more accurate description might be that the camera \"dollies forward\" or \"walks forward,\" maintaining a consistent distance behind the man initially before closing the gap, which is what makes him grow larger in the frame. The description of the camera becoming \"stationary\" is also slightly misleading if \"continued handheld shaking\" is present; it would be clearer to state that the camera's forward movement ceases, but it continues to hold its position with a slight, organic wobble. Furthermore, the claim of \"deep focus\" might be an oversimplification. It's more likely a moderately deep depth of field, where the man and the helicopter in the midground are sharp, but the distant background (perhaps a hazy mountain range or airfield buildings) exhibits some softness. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the *purpose* of the unsteadiness—it's not just shaky, but likely a result of the operator walking on uneven ground and being buffeted by the helicopter's rotor wash, which adds a sense of urgency and realism. Finally, the description could benefit from mentioning the framing; for instance, the man is likely kept in the center of the frame to emphasize him as the focal point of the action.",
