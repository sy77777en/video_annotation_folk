    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from an eye-level perspective with a generally level camera angle, occasionally tilting slightly up and down, creating brief high-angle views.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video maintains a generally level angle, but there is slight tilting down and up, creating brief moments of a high angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The unsteady camera, capturing a screen from a first-person perspective, intermittently tilts downward as the person looks down to plug or unplug the USB connected to the screen.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is good, but it can be significantly improved in terms of accuracy, completeness, and structure based on the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Overall:** The caption correctly identifies several key aspects of the video, such as the camera height, unsteadiness, and shallow depth of field. However, it is partially inaccurate about the focus and slightly repetitive in its description of movement.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"eye-level perspective with a generally level camera angle\" is correct for a seated person.\n    *   **Angle Change:** \"occasionally tilting slightly up and down, creating brief high-angle views\" accurately describes the camera looking down at the USB port.\n    *   **Depth of Field:** \"features a shallow depth of field\" is correct, as the background is clearly out of focus.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"The camera is unsteady, with noticeable shaking\" is a perfect description of the handheld movement.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Imprecise:**\n    *   **Focus:** The statement \"focusing on the foreground\" is incomplete and therefore misleading. The focus begins on the **midground** (the monitor screen). It only shifts to the **foreground** to follow the action of the hand plugging in the cable, and then returns to the midground. The caption misses this dynamic focus change.\n    *   **Movement Description:** The phrase \"intermittently tilts downward\" is not precise. The camera performs one primary, purposeful tilt down and then a corresponding tilt back up. \"Intermittently\" suggests it happens multiple times randomly, which is not the case.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Focus Change:** The instructions specifically ask to describe dynamic focus changes (like a rack focus or focus tracking). The caption fails to mention the crucial shift in focus from the midground monitor to the foreground hand.\n    *   **Movement Purpose & Full Motion:** While the caption implies the purpose of the tilt, it doesn't explicitly state it. More importantly, it only mentions the tilt *down* and omits the corresponding tilt *up* that returns the view to the monitor screen.\n    *   **Conciseness through Structure:** The caption mentions the tilt twice (once in the first sentence and again in the last). These could be combined for better flow and conciseness.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly uses terminology like \"eye-level,\" \"high-angle,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n    *   It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., normal video speed, no lens distortion), as instructed.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   It fails to fully follow the instruction to describe **focus changes** and the **focus plane** at each stage.\n    *   It doesn't describe the camera movements in a clear temporal order (tilt down, then tilt up).\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a seated eye-level, this unsteady, handheld video uses a shallow depth of field. The camera first tilts down from the midground monitor to follow a hand in the foreground, creating a high-angle view of a USB port being connected. The focus shifts from the monitor to the hand during this action. The camera then tilts back up, returning focus to the monitor screen.\"**\n\n### Why the Revised Caption is Better\n\n*   **Accuracy:** It correctly identifies the focus plane starting at the **midground** (monitor) and shifting to the **foreground** (hand).\n*   **Completeness:** It describes the full sequence of movement (**tilts down, then tilts back up**) and explicitly mentions the **focus change**, fulfilling a key part of the instructions.\n*   **Structure and Conciseness:** It describes the action chronologically in a single, flowing narrative without repetition.\n*   **Terminology:** It continues to use precise terms (\"seated eye-level,\" \"unsteady,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"high-angle,\" \"tilts,\" \"focus shifts\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Shot from a seated eye-level, this unsteady, handheld video employs a shallow depth of field. The camera initially tilts down from the midground monitor to follow a hand in the foreground, creating a high-angle view as a USB port is connected. During this action, the focus shifts from the monitor to the hand. The camera then tilts back up, returning focus to the monitor screen.",
