    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a high angle, looking down at the red panda. As the red panda moves right and away, the camera smoothly pans right and tilts up to a level angle, following the animal’s movement. Midway, the camera transitions to a trucking right motion to continue tracking the red panda from the side, resulting in the red panda becoming smaller in the frame. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, and the movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans right while tilting up to a level angle, following the red panda as it moves right and away from the camera. Midway, it transitions to trucking right to keep tracking the panda.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side while tilting. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera movements, it misinterprets the focus and the relationship between the camera's actions and their on-screen results. The assertion of \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is incorrect; the video clearly uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the red panda in crisp focus while the background foliage and wooden climbing structure are softly blurred, a common technique to isolate the subject. The description of the initial angle is also slightly confusing; it would be more accurate to state that the camera, held at eye-level, begins with a moderate high angle shot of the red panda on the ground before tilting up to a level angle as the animal climbs a small ramp. Furthermore, the caption incorrectly implies the trucking motion causes the red panda to become smaller. The red panda appears smaller because it is moving away from the camera; the trucking motion is a separate, simultaneous action performed to keep the animal framed from the side rather than letting it walk out of the shot. A more precise description would be: \"The camera begins with a moderate high-angle shot, then smoothly pans right and tilts up to follow the red panda, combining this with a slow trucking motion to the right to maintain a profile view as the animal moves away and subsequently appears smaller in the frame.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera starts with a moderate high-angle shot at eye level, capturing the red panda on the ground. As the red panda moves right and climbs a small ramp, the camera smoothly pans right and tilts up to a level angle, following the animal's movement. Simultaneously, a slow trucking motion to the right is employed to maintain a profile view, ensuring the red panda remains in the frame as it moves away and appears smaller. The video uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the red panda in sharp focus while softly blurring the background foliage and wooden climbing structure, effectively isolating the subject. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking throughout.",
