    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a high angle, looking down at the red panda. As the red panda moves right and away, the camera smoothly pans right and tilts up to a level angle, following the animal’s movement. Midway, the camera transitions to a trucking right motion to continue tracking the red panda from the side, resulting in the red panda becoming smaller in the frame. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, and the movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans right while tilting up to a level angle, following the red panda as it moves right and away from the camera. Midway, it transitions to trucking right to keep tracking the panda.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side while tilting. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and does an exceptional job of adhering to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its use of technical cinematography terms:\n*   **Height and Angle:** It correctly distinguishes between camera height (`eye level`) and camera angle (`high angle` transitioning to `level angle`). This accurately depicts a scenario where an operator is standing and looking down at a subject on a lower plane, then adjusting as the subject moves away and up an incline or branch.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the camera movements is precise. It correctly identifies the rotational movements (`pans right`, `tilts up`) and the translational movement (`trucking right`). It also correctly states the purpose of the movement, which is \"following the animal's movement.\"\n*   **Focus:** The use of \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is accurate for a shot where both the subject and its surroundings are sharp.\n*   **Cause and Effect:** The caption correctly links the camera's movement to the subject's action and notes the resulting change in framing (\"the red panda becoming smaller in the frame\").\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully includes all the required elements while remaining concise:\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It covers height, angle, movement, and focus as requested.\n*   **Conciseness:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, which implies they are standard or not present, just as the instructions advised.\n*   **Movement Description:** It details the type (`pan`, `tilt`, `trucking`), direction (`right`, `up`), steadiness (`smooth with minimal shaking`), and purpose (`following the animal`). The movements are described in a clear temporal order (\"begins with...\", \"As the red panda moves...\", \"Midway...\").\n*   **Focus Description:** It clearly defines the depth of field (`deep focus`, `large depth of field`) and its consistency (`maintains... throughout`).\n\n### Areas for Minor Improvement\nWhile the caption is excellent, it could be made even more precise with a couple of minor tweaks:\n\n1.  **Integrating Concurrent Movements:** The description separates the pan/tilt from the trucking motion (\"...pans right and tilts up... Midway, the camera transitions to a trucking right motion\"). In reality, these movements are likely happening simultaneously to keep the subject framed. A slightly more fluid description would be:\n    *   *Alternative:* \"To follow the red panda, the camera smoothly pans and trucks to the right while tilting up, transitioning from an initial high angle to a level angle.\"\n\n2.  **Clarifying \"Eye Level\":** The phrase \"positioned at eye level and begins with a high angle\" is perfectly understandable but could be interpreted as a slight contradiction. A more precise phrasing would clarify that the camera's *position* is at eye-level relative to the operator, while the *angle* is high relative to the subject.\n    *   *Alternative:* \"The shot begins from an eye-level height, using a high angle to look down at the red panda.\"\n\nThese are very minor points. The original caption is clear, effective, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Yes, the caption is good.** It is a high-quality description that is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the provided instructions almost perfectly. It uses correct terminology to create a clear and concise picture of the video's technical and visual characteristics.",
