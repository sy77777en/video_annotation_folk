    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good foundation by identifying the eye-level angle and shallow depth of field, it misses several key dynamic elements and lacks the specificity required. The description of movement as \"mostly static, with a slight unsteadiness\" is too general; in the video, the camera operator makes subtle, corrective pans and tilts to keep the reporter perfectly framed as she gestures and shifts her weight, a deliberate organic movement that enhances the sense of live reporting. Furthermore, the focus is not entirely static. Midway through, the reporter points over her shoulder at an unfolding event in the midground, and the camera executes a quick rack focus to the event to emphasize her point before smoothly returning focus to her face. The caption should describe this dynamic focus shift and the change in the focus plane. The caption also incorrectly assumes a single, continuous shot. The video actually contains a hard cut to a tight close-up on the reporter's face for emphasis as she delivers her concluding line, before cutting back to the initial medium shot. A complete description would need to be segmented to detail the framing of both the initial medium shot and the subsequent close-up, as well as noting the hard cut transition between them.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with an eye-level, medium shot of the female reporter, captured with a shallow depth of field that keeps her in sharp focus against a softly blurred background. The camera, handheld, introduces subtle, corrective pans and tilts to maintain the reporter perfectly framed as she gestures and shifts her weight, enhancing the live reporting feel. Midway through, as the reporter points over her shoulder to an event unfolding in the midground, the camera executes a quick rack focus to highlight the event before smoothly returning focus to her face. The sequence includes a hard cut to a tight close-up of the reporter's face, emphasizing her concluding line, before cutting back to the initial medium shot. This dynamic focus shift and the transition between shots add depth and engagement to the report.",
