    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it correctly identifies some aspects, it fundamentally misinterprets the most significant element of the camera work—the movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the camera as a **\"high-angle, aerial shot\"** is correct. The viewpoint is significantly elevated above the character.\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the focus as **\"deep focus, ensuring the entire game level is clear and sharp\"** is also correct. As is typical for this style of game, there is no shallow depth of field; all elements are in focus.\n*   **Highly Inaccurate:** The statement that the camera is **\"mostly static, exhibiting only minor, smooth, and unintentional movements\"** is completely wrong.\n    *   **Not Static:** The camera is in near-constant motion, actively following the player character around the level.\n    *   **Not Minor:** The movements are significant, covering large distances across the game map as the character moves.\n    *   **Not Unintentional:** The camera movement is the primary mechanism for framing the action. It is a deliberately programmed \"follow-cam\" designed specifically to track the player. This is its core purpose and function.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption fails to describe the most important camera action: **tracking**. The instructions explicitly ask to describe movements like \"tracking (following a subject),\" which is precisely what the camera is doing.\n*   It fails to identify the **purpose** of the movement, which is to keep the player character centered within the frame.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard/absent, which adheres to the conciseness rule.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption fails the main instruction to provide an **\"informative description of the... movements (translation, rotation... tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose).\"** By mislabeling the movement as \"static\" and \"unintentional,\" it provides misinformation.\n*   It successfully adheres to the instruction to be concise by not mentioning normal video speed or the absence of distortion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is poor because its description of the camera's movement is factually incorrect and misses the most defining characteristic of the shot. It mistakes a deliberate, functional tracking movement for a minor, unintentional flaw, which fundamentally misrepresents how the video is framed.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that accurately follows the provided instructions:\n\n\"This high-angle, aerial shot utilizes a deep focus, keeping the entire game environment sharp. The camera smoothly **tracks** the player character, moving horizontally and vertically to keep them centered in the frame as they navigate the level.\"",
