    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, focusing on a manhole cover. It starts with a high angle, looking down, and then cranes down smoothly below the surface, transitioning underground. The camera angle shifts to a low angle, looking up, revealing a bomb with dynamite, wires, and a timer. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. The motion is primarily downward with an upward tilt, and it moves slightly forward near the end. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at ground level, focusing on a manhole cover, then cranes down smoothly below the surface, transitioning underground to reveal a bomb with dynamite, wires, and a timer attached.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves downward and tilts upward for most of the video, revealing a bomb artifact. Near the end, it moves slightly forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great test of the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good. It accurately captures the main actions and visual elements of the video. However, it could be improved by using more precise terminology from the instructions and by being slightly more specific about the combination of movements.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The general descriptions are correct. The camera does start at ground level, move downward through a manhole, shift to a low angle, and focus on a bomb with a shallow depth of field. The movement is indeed smooth.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracies/Imprecisions:**\n    *   **\"high angle\"**: While technically a high angle, the camera is looking almost directly down at the start. The more precise term from the instructions would be **bird's eye angle**.\n    *   **\"cranes down\"**: A crane shot typically involves an arcing motion (moving up/down in a curve). This movement is a straight vertical drop. The more accurate term from the instructions is **pedestaling down**.\n    *   **\"moves slightly forward\"**: This is accurate, but the specific term for this camera movement is **dollying in**.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully covers most of the required elements:\n    *   **Camera Height:** Correctly identifies `ground-level` and the transition `underground`.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Correctly notes the starting angle (`high angle`/`bird's eye`) and the ending angle (`low angle`).\n    *   **Movements:** It correctly identifies the primary downward motion, the upward tilt, and the slight forward push.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly identifies the `shallow depth of field` and the `midground` focus plane.\n    *   **Steadiness:** It correctly notes the movement is `very smooth`.\n*   **Omissions/Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Combined Movements:** The caption describes the movements sequentially (\"downward with an upward tilt\"). It could be slightly more complete by describing them as simultaneous actions (e.g., \"the camera pedestals down while simultaneously tilting up\").\n    *   **Shot Type:** It's a single, continuous shot with no cuts. While not explicitly required for a single-shot video, mentioning this can add clarity.\n    *   **Omission of Irrelevant Details:** The caption correctly follows the instruction to omit details like `video speed`, `lens distortion`, and `Dutch angle` since they are not present. This is a point in its favor.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and easy to read. It avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice, though in this case, the instructions specifically ask for the technical jargon.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** This is the main area for improvement. The caption uses general terms (\"high angle,\" \"cranes down\") where the instructions provide more specific, technical terms (**bird's eye angle**, **pedestaling down**, **dollying in**). Adhering more closely to the provided glossary of terms would make the caption stronger.\n*   **Structure:** The caption follows a logical, temporal order, describing the shot from beginning to end, which is excellent.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption (for comparison)\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more strictly to the instructions:\n\n**\"The single, continuous shot begins at ground-level with a bird's eye angle on a manhole cover. The camera pedestals down through the opening while simultaneously tilting up, transitioning underground to a low angle. It settles on a bomb in the midground, which is kept in sharp focus by a shallow depth of field. The camera then dollys in slightly toward the bomb. The entire movement is perfectly smooth.\"**",
