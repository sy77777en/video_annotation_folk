    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from a smooth, high-angle overhead perspective. It employs a speed ramp effect, starting with a brief moment of reverse playback before transitioning to slow-motion forward playback.\n\nThe camera tracks a motorcyclist performing a wheelie, moving forward and tilting up slightly to keep them in the frame. As the camera follows, the motorcyclist becomes smaller in the shot. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks a motorcyclist from an aerial downward perspective. The video begins with reverse playback, making the camera appear to move backward. After the first second, normal playback resumes, and the camera moves forward. Near the end, it tilts up slightly to keep tracking the motorcyclist.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is good, but it contains a few key inaccuracies regarding the camera's movement and framing. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Perspective:** \"smooth, high-angle overhead perspective\" is largely correct. The shot is indeed smooth (likely from a drone with a gimbal), and it is from an overhead, high-angle view.\n    *   **Video Speed:** The description of the \"speed ramp effect, starting with a brief moment of reverse playback before transitioning to slow-motion\" is perfectly accurate.\n    *   **Movement Type:** Identifying the movement as \"tracks a motorcyclist\" is correct.\n    *   **Focus:** The observation that \"A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp\" is accurate.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Tilt:** The claim that the camera is \"tilting up slightly\" is inaccurate. The camera maintains a consistent **bird's-eye angle** (looking straight down) throughout the shot. A tilt would alter this perspective, but the angle remains fixed.\n    *   **Subject Size:** The statement \"As the camera follows, the motorcyclist becomes smaller in the shot\" is incorrect. The camera tracks the subject at a relatively constant altitude and speed, so the motorcyclist's size within the frame remains consistent. A subject becoming smaller would imply the camera is moving away (dollying out or craning up), which is not happening here.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers most of the required elements from the instructions: video speed, camera angle/height, primary movement, and focus.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as lens distortion or a Dutch angle, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n*   It could have been slightly more precise with its terminology. For instance, \"bird's-eye\" is a more specific and accurate term than \"high-angle\" for a top-down shot.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction:**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and well-structured.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses appropriate terms like \"speed ramp,\" \"slow-motion,\" \"tracks,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly avoids mentioning the absence of distortion or a Dutch angle.\n*   The primary failure in adherence is the factual inaccuracy of the movement description, not a failure to follow the structural or terminological guidelines.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong attempt that correctly identifies the most prominent features (the speed ramp and deep focus). However, its description of the camera's movement and the resulting framing is factually incorrect, which is a significant flaw.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately reflects the video according to the instructions:\n\n**This video is captured from a smooth, bird's-eye perspective at an overhead level. It utilizes a speed ramp, beginning with a brief time-reversed segment before transitioning to slow-motion. The camera tracks forward, following a motorcyclist performing a wheelie and maintaining their central position in the frame. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.**",
