    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from a smooth, high-angle overhead perspective. It employs a speed ramp effect, starting with a brief moment of reverse playback before transitioning to slow-motion forward playback.\n\nThe camera tracks a motorcyclist performing a wheelie, moving forward and tilting up slightly to keep them in the frame. As the camera follows, the motorcyclist becomes smaller in the shot. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks a motorcyclist from an aerial downward perspective. The video begins with reverse playback, making the camera appear to move backward. After the first second, normal playback resumes, and the camera moves forward. Near the end, it tilts up slightly to keep tracking the motorcyclist.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the core speed ramp effect and the general camera movement, it could be significantly more precise and vivid. The term \"high-angle overhead perspective\" is redundant; specifying an \"aerial-level\" shot would more clearly imply a drone, and you could clarify if the angle is a consistent high angle or if it tilts down towards a \"bird's-eye view\" as it follows the subject. The description of the movement is also slightly contradictory; if the camera \"tracks\" the motorcyclist but they become \"smaller,\" it suggests the camera is not keeping pace. A more accurate description might be that the camera performs a slow \"crane up and dolly back\" movement, causing the rider to diminish in the frame as they accelerate away. The caption also misses the opportunity to connect the speed effects to the action—for example, the reverse motion could show the front wheel coming *down* from the wheelie, the slow-motion could emphasize the rider's balance at the apex, and the return to normal speed could highlight their acceleration. Furthermore, while \"deep focus\" is noted, specifying that the focus is locked on the motorcyclist in the midground would be more informative. Lastly, given the likely use of a wide-angle lens for such a shot, the caption should mention if there is any subtle \"barrel distortion\" visible, causing straight lines like the road markings or horizon to appear slightly curved at the edges of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features an aerial-level shot, likely captured by a drone, that transitions from a high angle to a bird's-eye view as it follows a motorcyclist performing a wheelie. The sequence begins with a brief reverse motion, showing the front wheel coming down from the wheelie, before transitioning to slow-motion to emphasize the rider's balance at the apex. The camera executes a slow crane up and dolly back movement, causing the motorcyclist to appear smaller in the frame as they accelerate away. The focus is locked on the motorcyclist in the midground, maintaining sharpness throughout the scene. A wide-angle lens is used, with subtle barrel distortion visible, slightly curving straight lines like road markings or the horizon at the edges of the frame. The video concludes with a return to normal speed, highlighting the rider's acceleration.",
