    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slowly moves forward while slightly tilting up at first.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a very good and accurate description of the video, and it adheres well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"camera at eye level, looking straight ahead\" is a perfect description. The perspective is clearly that of a person walking.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"deep focus and large depth of field\" is correct. The entire scene, from the court lines in the immediate foreground to the buildings in the background, remains sharp and in focus.\n*   **Movement:** \"smoothly moves forward at a slow pace\" accurately captures the steady, forward dolly motion.\n*   **Subtle Details:** The caption correctly identifies the \"slight tilting up initially\" and the \"minimal shaking,\" which demonstrates a keen observation of the camera's behavior.\n\n**2. Completeness:** The caption successfully includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what isn't present.\n*   **Included:** It covers camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and a detailed breakdown of movement (translation, rotation, steadiness, and speed).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of detail into two clear sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Clarity over Jargon:** It uses clear, descriptive language like \"moves forward\" instead of the more technical \"dollies forward,\" which is perfectly acceptable and often preferable for general understanding.\n*   **Structure:** The description of movement is comprehensive, covering the type, speed, steadiness, and even a subtle initial rotation (the tilt).\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Enhancement\n\nThe caption is already excellent. If you wanted to make it even more concise or use slightly more technical cinematography terms as suggested in the instructions, you could combine the sentences and swap \"moves forward\" for \"dollies\":\n\n*   **Alternative Version:** \"From an eye-level perspective with a deep focus, the camera smoothly **dollies forward** at a slow pace, tilting up slightly at the start and maintaining minimal shaking to capture the basketball court and its surroundings.\"\n\nHowever, the original caption is arguably more readable and just as effective. The provided caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions.",
