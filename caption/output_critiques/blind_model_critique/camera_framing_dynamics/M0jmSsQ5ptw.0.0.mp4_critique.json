    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from an aerial-level perspective with a deep focus, keeping both the subject and the distant ground sharp. The shot begins with a still camera at a level angle, which has a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The camera then moves slightly forward and tilts down smoothly to track the skydiver as he jumps, causing the camera angle to shift to a high angle. During this tracking shot, the skydiver becomes smaller in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains still at first, then slightly moves forward and tilts down as the person jumps out of the helicopter.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tilting downward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the instructions.\n\nThe provided caption is very good and captures most of the required elements well, but it can be improved in terms of accuracy and adherence to the specific language of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies the height, focus, and the general sequence of movements. Its primary weakness is describing the *result* of a movement (the skydiver getting smaller) rather than the *camera action* that causes it, and it could use more precise terminology from the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of an aerial-level, deep-focus shot that starts still, has a Dutch angle, and then tilts down to track a skydiver is a very accurate interpretation of what is likely a helmet-cam video of a skydive.\n*   **Point of Inaccuracy/Misinterpretation:** The phrase \"**the skydiver becomes smaller in the frame**\" is an observation of the subject, not a description of a camera movement. The instructions ask you to describe the **camera's configuration and movement**. The skydiver gets smaller because the camera is not dollying forward or craning down to follow him at the same speed. The distance between the camera and the subject is increasing. The caption should describe the camera's action (or lack thereof) that leads to this result.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Well-Covered:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"aerial-level\" - Correct.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus\" - Correct.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level angle\" shifting to a \"high angle\" - Excellent.\n    *   **Movements (Rotation):** \"tilts down,\" \"camera rolling\" - Excellent use of correct terminology.\n    *   **Movements (Purpose):** \"to track the skydiver\" - Correct.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** \"has a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling\" - This is a fantastic and precise description.\n*   **Minor Omissions:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The instructions suggest stating \"the camera is static\" if it is. The caption says \"still camera,\" which is good, but using the term \"static\" is more aligned with the provided examples.\n    *   **Translation Movement:** The caption says the camera \"moves slightly forward.\" The more precise term from the instructions for this movement is **dollying** (or \"dollies in\").\n    *   **Steadiness:** The mention of a \"variable Dutch angle\" implies some instability, but the overall steadiness of the shot (e.g., \"minor instability from being body-mounted\") is not explicitly stated.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strong Adherence:** The caption successfully uses specific terms like `aerial-level`, `deep focus`, `level angle`, `high angle`, `tilts down`, `track`, and `Dutch angle`. It also correctly follows the rule of not mentioning regular video speed or the absence of lens distortion.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The main deviation, as mentioned, is describing the subject's change in size instead of the camera's movement. The instructions are very specific: \"describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement.\" The camera isn't \"making the subject smaller\"; it is remaining in a relatively fixed position as the subject moves away.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that more strictly adheres to all instructions:\n\n> This aerial-level shot maintains a deep focus. It begins as a **static**, level-angle shot with a variable Dutch angle caused by camera rolling. The camera then **dollies forward** slightly and **tilts down** smoothly to track a skydiver, shifting the camera's perspective to a high angle. The camera does not follow the subject's descent, causing the distance between them to increase.\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n1.  **Uses \"Static\":** Incorporates the specific term from the instructions.\n2.  **Uses \"Dollies Forward\":** Replaces \"moves forward\" with the more precise technical term.\n3.  **Corrects the Final Clause:** Instead of saying \"the skydiver becomes smaller,\" it accurately describes the camera's action: \"**The camera does not follow the subject's descent, causing the distance between them to increase.**\" This focuses on the camera's behavior, as required by the instructions.",
