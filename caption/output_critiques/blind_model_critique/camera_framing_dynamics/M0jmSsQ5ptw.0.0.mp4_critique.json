    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from an aerial-level perspective with a deep focus, keeping both the subject and the distant ground sharp. The shot begins with a still camera at a level angle, which has a Dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling. The camera then moves slightly forward and tilts down smoothly to track the skydiver as he jumps, causing the camera angle to shift to a high angle. During this tracking shot, the skydiver becomes smaller in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains still at first, then slightly moves forward and tilts down as the person jumps out of the helicopter.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tilting downward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption accurately identifies the aerial perspective, deep focus, and the shift from a level to a high angle. However, there are a few points that could be more precise. The description of the shot beginning with a \"still camera\" is likely an oversimplification; in a video filmed from a plane, there would almost certainly be minor vibrations or a slight, natural handheld wobble, so \"relatively stable\" might be more accurate. The most significant issue is the contradictory use of \"tracking shot\" to describe a sequence where \"the skydiver becomes smaller in the frame.\" A true tracking shot implies the camera is moving with the subject, maintaining a relatively consistent size and distance. Since the skydiver is shrinking, the camera is either stationary (perhaps mounted on the plane) or moving much slower than the subject. A better description would be: \"The camera then pushes forward slightly and performs a smooth tilt down to follow the skydiver as he falls away from the plane, causing him to recede into the distance.\" This phrasing correctly describes the camera's movement (push-in and tilt) and its visual effect without misusing the term \"tracking.\" Additionally, given the context, the video was likely shot on a wide-angle lens (like a GoPro), which would explain the deep focus but might also introduce subtle barrel distortion, causing the straight lines of the plane's door to appear slightly curved, a detail that could be worth mentioning.",
