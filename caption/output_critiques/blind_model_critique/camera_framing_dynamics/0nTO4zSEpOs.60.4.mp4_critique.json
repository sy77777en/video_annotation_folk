    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, looking straight ahead. It smoothly pans right, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the people and buildings in the night cityscape. The camera then tilts up to a low angle, emphasizing the towering buildings, with minimal shaking throughout the motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera first pans right, then tilts up to reveal the night cityscape.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a near-perfect execution of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** It correctly identifies the starting position as `eye level` and `level angle` (\"looking straight ahead\"), and accurately notes the transition to a `low angle` as the camera tilts up.\n*   **Camera Movement:** It correctly identifies the two primary movements in their temporal order: a smooth `pan right` followed by a `tilt up`. The description of the movement as \"smooth\" with \"minimal shaking\" is also precise.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The description of a `deep focus` with a `large depth of field` is spot-on. All elements in the frame, from the midground people to the background buildings, remain sharp and in focus throughout the shot.\n*   **Purpose:** It correctly infers the purpose of the tilt-up movement, which is to \"emphasize the towering buildings.\"\n\n### Completeness: Excellent\nThe caption successfully includes all the required information relevant to this specific video while correctly omitting what is not present.\n*   **Included:** It covers camera height, angle, movement (type, steadiness, order, purpose), and focus (depth of field).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is not tilted, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful understanding of the instructions.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The description is compact but packed with accurate technical details, creating a clear mental image of the shot without unnecessary words.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as `pan`, `tilt`, `low angle`, `deep focus`, and `depth of field`.\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description follows the chronological flow of the camera's actions (\"The video begins with...\", \"The camera then tilts up...\"), making it easy to follow.\n*   **Follows Omission Rule:** It perfectly adheres to the rule of not mentioning standard attributes like regular playback speed or the absence of distortion, which contributes to its conciseness.\n\n**Overall Judgment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to apply the given instructions, balancing technical detail with clarity and conciseness. It accurately deconstructs the shot's configuration and movement, uses the correct vocabulary, and intelligently omits irrelevant information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video starts with the camera positioned at eye level, looking straight ahead. It smoothly pans to the right, maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing both the people and buildings in the night cityscape.
