    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains stationary for a moment at the beginning. Then it starts zooming in with a slight downward tilt.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It accurately describes the primary actions in the video but misses several key descriptive elements required by the detailed instructions, particularly regarding camera configuration and focus. It also has a minor redundancy that could be eliminated for better conciseness.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n*   **\"The video begins with a stationary camera focusing on a world map.\"** - Correct. The shot is static for the first moment.\n*   **\"It then smoothly zooms in with a slight downward tilt, centering on Uruguay.\"** - Correct. The movement is a smooth zoom, not a dolly. The camera does tilt down slightly to re-center the frame on Uruguay, which is in the southern hemisphere.\n*   **\"The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking.\"** - Correct. The movement is perfectly steady, suggesting a digital zoom or a professional tripod.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is **incomplete**. It successfully identifies the movement but omits several required details about the camera's static properties.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n*   **Camera Angle:** The shot is filmed from a **level angle**. This was not mentioned.\n*   **Camera Height:** The camera is positioned at **eye-level**, as if a person is standing in front of the map. This was not mentioned.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The entire map is sharp and in focus, which should be described as **deep focus** (or simply \"everything is in focus\" since the subject is flat). This was not mentioned.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** While implied, the instruction asks to state the purpose if relevant. The purpose here is clearly to **isolate and draw attention** from the entire world to the specific country of Uruguay.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to some instructions but falls short on others.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Conciseness (Partial):** The first two sentences are concise and informative.\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly avoids mentioning the absence of lens distortion, Dutch angles, or altered video speed, as per the instructions.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Conciseness (Redundancy):** The final sentence, \"The camera movement is very smooth, with no shaking,\" is redundant. The word \"smoothly\" in the previous sentence already conveys this information. The instruction emphasizes conciseness, and this repetition could be removed.\n*   **Inclusion of All Required Elements:** As noted under \"Completeness,\" it fails to include the required descriptions of camera angle, height, and focus.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the missing details and adheres more closely to all instructions:\n\n**\"From a static, eye-level, and level-angle perspective, the camera smoothly zooms in on a world map in deep focus, simultaneously tilting down to frame and highlight Uruguay.\"**\n\nThis revised version is better because it:\n1.  **Is More Complete:** It includes the camera height (`eye-level`), angle (`level-angle`), and focus (`deep focus`).\n2.  **Is More Concise:** It removes the redundant final sentence about the movement being smooth.\n3.  **States the Purpose:** It clarifies the purpose of the movement is \"to frame and highlight Uruguay.\"\n4.  **Uses Precise Language:** It combines the description of the initial state and the subsequent movement into a single, efficient sentence.",
