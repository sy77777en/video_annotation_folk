    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption for the video.\n\n**Evaluation of the Caption:**\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It is concise and accurately identifies several key aspects of the shot, but it misses some important details and slightly mischaracterizes the camera's movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Feedback**\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"Filmed from a level, eye-level perspective...\"**: **Accurate.** The camera is pointed straight ahead (level angle) and positioned at a height consistent with a person's point of view (eye-level).\n*   **\"...the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**: **Accurate.** Everything from the foreground leaves to the background trees is in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"...a very slow and smooth forward movement.\"**: **Partially Accurate.** The movement is indeed slow and forward. However, describing it as \"smooth\" is an oversimplification. There is a clear, subtle, and organic bobbing and swaying motion characteristic of a person walking. A truly \"smooth\" movement would imply a dolly or gimbal, which would eliminate this natural motion.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** The caption fails to mention the **mild barrel distortion** present in the video. The straight lines of tree trunks near the edges of the frame curve slightly outwards, which is a key characteristic of the wide-angle lens being used.\n    *   **Movement Character:** The description of the movement lacks detail. It correctly identifies the forward motion but omits the natural **sway and bob of a walking POV**, which is a defining feature of the shot's feel and steadiness.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise, as requested.\n    *   **Omission of Normals:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed, Dutch angle, or shot transitions, as these are either normal or not present, adhering perfectly to the instruction to avoid unnecessary information.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   It fails to provide a complete description of the camera's configuration by omitting the lens distortion.\n    *   The description of the camera's movement (specifically its steadiness) is not as informative as it could be.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption provides a good, high-level summary. However, to be fully compliant with the detailed instructions, it needs to be more precise about the nature of the camera's movement and include the observable lens distortion.\n\n### **Revised, More Complete Caption Example:**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n\"Filmed from a level, eye-level perspective, this shot exhibits **mild barrel distortion**. The camera moves forward at a **slow walking pace**, maintaining a **relatively steady** motion with a slight, natural sway. A **deep focus** keeps the entire lush environment sharp.\"",
