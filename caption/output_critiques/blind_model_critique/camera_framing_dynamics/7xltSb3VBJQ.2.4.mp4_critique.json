    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward, pans left, and then keeps moving forward to reveal a wider view of the street.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is a very good and accurate description of the video, adhering closely to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward, pans left, and continues moving forward to reveal a wider view of the street. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in all its claims:\n\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The perspective is clearly from a person's point of view, making **\"eye level\"** and **\"level angle\"** correct.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** All elements in the frame, from the foreground pavement to the distant buildings, are in focus. **\"Deep focus\"** and **\"large depth of field\"** are perfect descriptions.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The camera's movement is correctly described in sequential order: it first **moves forward**, then **pans left** to turn the corner, and finally **continues moving forward**.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The description **\"to reveal a wider view of the street\"** accurately captures the result of the pan and subsequent forward motion.\n*   **Steadiness:** The shot is not perfectly smooth; it has the natural bob and sway of being handheld by someone walking. **\"Slightly unsteady with some shaking\"** is an accurate assessment.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is comprehensive and covers all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions that are present in the video:\n\n*   **Configuration:** It correctly identifies height, angle, and focus.\n*   **Movement:** It details the type of movement (translation and rotation), the sequence, the steadiness, and the purpose.\n*   **Omissions:** Crucially, it correctly omits details that are not present, as per the instructions. There is no altered video speed, no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, so these are rightly not mentioned, which contributes to its conciseness.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs all the necessary information into two clear and efficient sentences.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses the correct terminology for camera angle (`level angle`), height (`eye level`), focus (`deep focus`), and movement (`pans left`).\n*   **Movement Description:** It describes the movements in the correct temporal order and includes the purpose, as requested.\n*   **Steadiness:** It correctly notes the lack of perfect stability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Yes, the caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, thorough without being verbose, and uses the correct technical language to describe the video's configuration and cinematography.",
