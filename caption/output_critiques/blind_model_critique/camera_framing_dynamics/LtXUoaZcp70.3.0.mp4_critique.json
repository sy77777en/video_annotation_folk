    "pre_caption": "This video features a smooth camera movement that starts with a level, eye-level shot of a single 3D-rendered figure. The camera then moves backward and upward while tilting down, transitioning to a high-angle, overhead perspective. This motion reveals that the initial figure is one of several seated around a circular table. A deep focus is maintained throughout the shot, keeping all the figures and the table sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts with a level-angle view of a 3D model of a human figure. It then moves backward and upward while tilting downward, gradually revealing more figures seated around a table, ultimately presenting an top-down perspective.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nBased on the description, the caption accurately portrays a plausible and common type of camera shot, especially in 3D animation or motion graphics.\n\n*   **Movement Logic:** The described movement—pulling back and craning up while tilting down—is a classic \"reveal\" shot. It logically transitions the viewer from a close, personal view of one subject to a wider, more contextual overhead view of a group.\n*   **Technical Terms:** The use of terms like \"level,\" \"eye-level,\" \"high-angle,\" and \"overhead\" is precise and correctly describes the progression of the shot.\n*   **Focus:** The mention of \"deep focus\" is particularly fitting for a 3D-rendered scene, where achieving infinite depth of field is simple and often a default setting.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, touching on all the relevant points from the instructions without adding unnecessary information.\n\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It clearly defines the starting **height** (`eye-level`) and **angle** (`level shot`).\n*   **Camera Movement:** It provides a comprehensive description of the movement:\n    *   **Type & Direction:** It combines multiple movements (`moves backward` [dollying], `upward` [pedestaling/craning], and `tilting down`).\n    *   **Steadiness:** It specifies the movement is `smooth`.\n    *   **Purpose:** It explicitly states the purpose of the motion: to `reveal` the larger scene.\n*   **Focus:** It clearly describes the **depth of field** (`deep focus`) and its consistency (`maintained throughout the shot`).\n*   **Omissions:** Crucially, it correctly omits details that are not present. By not mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, it correctly implies the video is at regular speed with a standard lens and a level horizon, just as the instructions direct.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is only four sentences long but is packed with specific, technical information. It avoids fluff and gets straight to the point.\n*   **Temporal Order:** The description follows the action chronologically: it describes the starting shot, the movement itself, and the resulting final shot and reveal.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specified vocabulary from the instructions correctly and effectively.\n*   **No Shot Transitions:** Since the description implies a single, continuous shot, it correctly avoids any mention of cuts or transitions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and concise. It demonstrates a strong understanding of camera terminology and the ability to synthesize complex visual information into a clear, structured description. There are no significant improvements to be made.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases a seamless camera movement beginning with a level, eye-level shot of a solitary 3D-rendered figure. The camera smoothly pulls back and ascends while tilting downward, transitioning to a high-angle, overhead view. This motion unveils that the initial figure is part of a group seated around a circular table. Throughout the shot, deep focus is maintained, ensuring all figures and the table remain sharp.",
