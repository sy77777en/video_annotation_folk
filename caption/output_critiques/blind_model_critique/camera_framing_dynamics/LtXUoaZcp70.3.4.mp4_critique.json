    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the midground, and later becomes focused on the foreground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is very good—it is accurate, concise, and uses the correct terminology for the focus change. However, it could be slightly more complete by incorporating a few more specific terms from the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on Your Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves backward. The shot begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on a red figure in the midground. It then performs a rack focus, shifting the plane of focus to a blue figure in the foreground.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\nEverything stated in the caption is factually correct.\n*   **Movement:** The camera movement is indeed smooth and backward.\n*   **Height:** \"Hip-level\" is an accurate description of the camera's height relative to the subjects.\n*   **Focus:** The description of the shallow depth of field, the initial focus on the midground, the use of a \"rack focus,\" and the final focus on the foreground is perfect.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Good\nThe caption captures the most important elements but omits a few details mentioned in the instructions.\n*   **Missing - Camera Angle:** The caption mentions camera height (`hip-level`) but not the camera angle. In this case, it's a **level angle**.\n*   **Missing - Specific Movement Term:** The instructions encourage using specific terms like \"dollying.\" While \"moves backward\" is correct, **\"dollies backward\"** or **\"dollies out\"** is the more precise technical term.\n*   **Missing - Movement Speed:** The dolly is performed at a **slow and steady pace**, which could be mentioned for added detail.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Very Good\nThe caption follows the instructions well, especially regarding conciseness and focus description.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   You correctly used advanced terms like **\"shallow depth of field\"** and **\"rack focus\"**, which were explicitly requested.\n    *   You correctly identified the **focus planes** (midground, foreground).\n    *   You correctly followed the instruction to be concise by omitting details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none were present.\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary area for improvement is incorporating the more specific terminology for camera movement (`dollying`) and adding the camera angle (`level angle`) as outlined in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption for Comparison\n\nHere is an example of a caption that incorporates the feedback to be slightly more comprehensive while remaining concise:\n\n**\"From a smooth, hip-level, and level angle, the camera dollies backward at a slow, steady pace. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, beginning with the focus on a red figure in the midground before executing a rack focus to the blue figure in the foreground.\"**\n\nThis revised version is more technically complete by adding \"level angle,\" \"dollies backward,\" and \"slow, steady pace,\" fully aligning with the detailed instructions provided.",
