    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. It contains significant inaccuracies and omits key information required by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The camera is positioned at hip level with a high angle, looking down. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the person in the midground. The camera smoothly zooms in with minor movement, maintaining steadiness throughout.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is largely inaccurate in its description of the camera's configuration and movement.\n\n*   **Correct Elements:**\n    *   **Shallow Depth of Field:** The caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field, as the background is clearly blurred while the subject is sharp.\n    *   **Focus on Midground:** It correctly states that the focus is on the person in the midground.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The camera movement is indeed very steady, suggesting the use of a gimbal or Steadicam.\n\n*   **Incorrect Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The caption claims a \"hip level with a high angle, looking down.\" This is the opposite of what is shown. The camera is positioned very low, near **ground-level**, and is angled **up** at the subject, creating a **low angle** shot.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The caption states the camera \"smoothly zooms in.\" This is incorrect. A zoom involves changing the lens's focal length. The camera is physically moving backward—a **dolly out** or **tracking backward**—to maintain a consistent frame on the subject as they walk forward. The perspective shift and parallax of the background elements confirm this is a physical camera movement, not an optical zoom.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption fails to provide a complete description according to the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Movement Description:** It misses the primary camera movement entirely. Instead of describing the **dolly out / tracking backward** motion, it vaguely says \"minor movement\" and incorrectly identifies a zoom. The instructions specifically ask for descriptions of movements like tracking and dollying.\n*   **Missing Focus Dynamics:** The instructions ask to describe focus changes like *focus tracking*. As the person walks toward the camera, the focus plane must continuously shift to keep them sharp. The caption fails to mention this dynamic **focus tracking**.\n*   **Missing Purpose of Movement:** It does not explain the purpose of the movement, which is to follow the subject and maintain their framing within the shot.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key parts of the instructions.\n\n*   It incorrectly identifies **camera angle** and **camera height**.\n*   It fails to describe the primary **translation** movement (dollying/tracking) and instead invents a **zooming** movement that isn't there.\n*   It omits the description of **focus changes** (focus tracking), which is a required element for dynamic focus.\n*   While it is concise, its conciseness comes at the cost of accuracy and completeness, making it misleading.\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately follows the instructions:\n\n\"From a low, near-ground-level angle, the shot uses a shallow depth of field to isolate the subject in the midground. The camera smoothly tracks backward (dollies out) at a steady pace, maintaining a consistent distance from the person as they walk forward, while continuously adjusting focus to keep them sharp.\"",
