    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right and rolling clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the camera movement. It successfully captures several key aspects of the shot but misidentifies one of the primary camera actions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy:\n\n*   **\"high-angle, overhead shot\"**: **Mostly Accurate.** The shot is indeed taken from directly above, which is best described as an **overhead shot** or a **bird's-eye view**. While \"high-angle\" is not technically wrong, \"overhead\" is more specific and sufficient. Using both is slightly redundant.\n*   **\"deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp\"**: **Accurate.** All elements in the frame, from the person on the bed to the surrounding floor and furniture, are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"very smooth and subtle movement\"**: **Accurate.** The camera's motion is steady, slow, and fluid.\n*   **\"slowly panning from left to right\"**: **Inaccurate.** This is the main error. The camera is not **panning** (rotating horizontally like shaking your head \"no\"). The primary movement is a **roll**.\n*   **\"simultaneously rolling clockwise\"**: **Accurate.** The camera is rotating around the central axis of its lens in a clockwise direction, which is correctly identified as a \"roll.\" The \"panning\" mentioned is an incorrect interpretation of the visual effect created by this roll.\n\n#### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and follows the instruction to omit details like normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n*   **Camera Configuration:**\n    *   **Angle/Height:** Correctly identified.\n    *   **Focus:** Correctly identified as deep focus.\n    *   **Movement:** The caption attempts to describe the movement's type, speed, and steadiness as instructed. It correctly identifies the roll, speed, and smoothness but fails on the \"pan.\"\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendation\n\nThe caption is effective in its description of the angle, focus, and overall feel of the movement. However, its technical description of the camera's movement is flawed. The term \"panning\" is incorrect and should be removed to improve accuracy.\n\nA more accurate and improved caption would be:\n\n**\"This is an overhead, bird's-eye view shot with a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a very smooth and slow clockwise roll.\"**\n\nThis revised version is more technically precise, slightly more concise, and fully accurate according to the video's content and the provided instructions.",
