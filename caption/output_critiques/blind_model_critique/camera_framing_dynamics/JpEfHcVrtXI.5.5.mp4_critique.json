    "pre_caption": "This is a side-view shot from a video game, where the camera maintains a level angle as it tracks a small, glowing character. The camera follows the character's upward movement as it jumps, moving with a mix of pauses and bursts of speed. The tracking is slightly unsteady, with some noticeable shakiness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** A side-view game where the camera follows the character from the side, moving upward as the character jumps. The movement tracks the character with pauses, bursts of speed, and some shakiness.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It accurately describes the most obvious aspects of the camera work (tracking, angle, unsteady movement) in a concise way. However, it fails to include several key details specifically requested in the instructions, most notably the **focus and depth of field**.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**. Every statement it makes correctly describes the video.\n\n*   **\"side-view shot from a video game\"**: Correct. This accurately sets the context and perspective.\n*   **\"camera maintains a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is not angled up or down at the character; it remains parallel to the ground plane.\n*   **\"tracks a small, glowing character\"**: Correct. The primary camera movement is tracking the subject.\n*   **\"follows the character's upward movement\"**: Correct. The main directional thrust of the movement is vertical.\n*   **\"moving with a mix of pauses and bursts of speed\"**: Correct. The camera's speed is not constant; it mirrors the character's start-stop platforming.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, with some noticeable shakiness\"**: Correct. The camera movement is not perfectly smooth and has a slight jitter, likely a deliberate effect.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **incomplete**. It omits several important details required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Focus and Depth of Field**: This is the most significant omission. The instructions dedicate a full paragraph to describing focus. The video clearly features a **shallow depth of field**, where the character is in sharp focus, but the background elements are noticeably blurred. The caption fails to mention this at all.\n*   **Missing - Specific Movement Types**: While \"tracking\" is a correct and useful summary, the instructions ask for more specific terms. The upward movement is **pedestaling**, and the slight side-to-side adjustments are **trucking**. Mentioning these would make the description more precise.\n*   **Missing - Purpose of Movement**: The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement if relevant. Here, the clear purpose is to **keep the character centered in the frame**, which is a detail worth noting.\n*   **Partially Missing - Camera Height**: The caption implies the height by mentioning a \"level angle,\" but it doesn't explicitly state that the camera's height changes (pedestals up) to stay level with the character as it ascends.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to some instructions but neglects others.\n\n*   **Adhered - Conciseness**: The caption is very concise, as requested.\n*   **Adhered - Omission of Unnecessary Details**: It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, as none are present.\n*   **Not Adhered - Informativeness**: By omitting details about focus and specific movement types, the caption is not as informative as it could be based on the detailed requirements. It prioritizes conciseness over the comprehensive description requested.\n*   **Not Adhered - Use of Terminology**: It misses the opportunity to use more technical terms like **pedestaling**, **trucking**, and **shallow depth of field**, which are encouraged by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that incorporates the missing elements while remaining reasonably concise, fully adhering to the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a side-view shot from a video game. The camera maintains a level angle as it tracks a small, glowing character, pedestaling upward to follow its jumps. The movement is slightly unsteady and occurs in bursts to keep the character centered. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, holding the character in sharp focus while the dark background remains softly blurred.\"**",
