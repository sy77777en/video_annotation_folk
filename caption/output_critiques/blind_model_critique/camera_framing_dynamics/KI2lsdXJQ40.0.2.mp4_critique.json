    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect description of the video and adheres flawlessly to all instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is 100% accurate.\n    *   **\"stop-motion video\"**: This is correct. The video is composed of a sequence of still images where objects (camera gear) are moved between frames to create the illusion of movement.\n    *   **\"static\"**: This is correct. The camera's frame does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom at all throughout the video.\n    *   **\"overhead, bird's-eye view\"**: This is a precise and accurate description. The camera is positioned directly above the scene (overhead height) and is pointing straight down (bird's-eye angle), capturing the flat lay of the items on the floor.\n    *   **\"deep focus, ensuring all the items... remain sharp and clear\"**: This is correct. The entire plane of action on the floor is in sharp focus, from the items at the top of the frame to those at the bottom. There is no shallow depth of field.\n\n*   **Completeness & Conciseness:** The caption strikes the perfect balance between being informative and concise, as requested by the instructions.\n    *   It correctly identifies all the key, non-standard features of the shot (stop-motion, static overhead position, deep focus).\n    *   It correctly omits details that are not present or are considered \"standard,\" such as lens distortion (the floorboards appear straight) and Dutch angles (the frame is level). This demonstrates a good understanding of the instruction to \"make the description as concise as possible.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the provided instructions perfectly.\n    *   **Video Speed:** It correctly identifies the video as \"stop-motion.\"\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** It clearly states the camera is \"static\" and describes the \"overhead\" height and \"bird's-eye\" angle.\n    *   **Focus:** It accurately describes the \"deep focus\" and its visual effect.\n    *   **Movements:** It correctly identifies the lack of movement by stating the camera is \"static.\"\n    *   **Transitions:** Since there are no shot transitions, it rightly doesn't mention them.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to apply the detailed instructions to a video, resulting in a description that is technically precise, easy to understand, and perfectly concise. No improvements are needed.",
