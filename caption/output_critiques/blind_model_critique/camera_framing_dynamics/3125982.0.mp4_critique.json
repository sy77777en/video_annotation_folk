    "pre_caption": "The video features a ground-level camera at a level angle, focusing on a woman doing push-ups with a shallow depth of field, emphasizing the foreground. The camera smoothly trucks right to follow her movements and slightly pans left at the end, maintaining minimal shaking throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera smoothly trucks right to show a woman doing push-ups and slightly pans left at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nYes, the caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and concise by correctly omitting irrelevant information.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** \"ground-level camera at a level angle\" is perfectly correct. The camera is positioned very low to the floor and is aimed straight ahead, not tilted up or down.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** \"shallow depth of field, emphasizing the foreground\" is an accurate description. The subject (the woman) is in sharp focus, while the background is clearly and intentionally blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is precise.\n    *   \"smoothly trucks right to follow her movements\" correctly identifies the primary camera motion. A \"truck\" is the correct term for moving the entire camera horizontally, parallel to the scene.\n    *   \"slightly pans left at the end\" shows a keen eye for detail. As the truck right movement concludes, the camera makes a small rotational adjustment to the left to keep the subject perfectly framed.\n    *   \"minimal shaking\" accurately describes the shot's stability, suggesting it was filmed with a gimbal or slider.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included:** It covers camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and a detailed breakdown of camera movement (type, direction, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it is correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** There are no dynamic focus changes like a rack focus, so it is correct not to mention them.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect understanding of the instructions' nuances.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is direct and avoids unnecessary words, just as requested.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specific, correct technical terms from the instructions (e.g., `trucks`, `pans`, `shallow depth of field`, `ground-level`).\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the information, starting with the static configuration (height, angle, focus) and then describing the dynamic movement.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is a perfect execution of the instructions. It is technically precise, comprehensive in its description of the relevant visual elements, and commendably concise. It successfully balances providing detailed information with readability.",
