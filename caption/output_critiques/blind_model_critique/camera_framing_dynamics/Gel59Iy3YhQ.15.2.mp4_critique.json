    "pre_caption": "The camera smoothly moves upward, revealing the top of a weathered lighthouse against a rainy, overcast sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nWhile it is concise and accurately describes the general action and subject of the video, it fails to provide the specific technical details about the camera's configuration and movement that the instructions explicitly demand.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies that the camera moves upward and that the subject is a lighthouse against a rainy sky.\n*   **Inaccurate/Vague:** The phrase \"moves upward\" is too generic. The instructions require specific terminology like **tilting**, **pedestaling**, or **craning**. A \"tilt\" is a rotation, while a \"pedestal\" or \"crane\" is a physical elevation of the entire camera. The caption does not distinguish between these, which is a critical failure in accuracy according to the prompt.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is highly incomplete and omits almost all of the required technical information.\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Angle:** It doesn't specify the starting or ending angle (e.g., *low angle*, *level angle*). An upward movement implies a change in angle, which should be described.\n*   **Missing - Camera Height:** There is no mention of the camera's height relative to the ground (e.g., *eye-level*, *ground-level*).\n*   **Missing - Specific Movement Type:** As mentioned, it uses the generic \"moves upward\" instead of the required specific terms. It also doesn't describe the **speed** of the movement (e.g., slow, moderate, fast).\n*   **Missing - Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The caption gives no information about the depth of field (*shallow* or *deep*), the focus plane (is the lighthouse sharp while the background is blurry?), or if there are any focus changes.\n*   **Missing - Other Details:** While it's correct to omit video speed and lens distortion if they are standard, the caption provides no confirmation.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fundamentally misunderstands the goal of the instructions.\n\n*   The instructions ask for a **\"description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"**\n*   The provided caption is a **narrative description of the scene's content.** It focuses on what the viewer sees (\"weathered lighthouse,\" \"rainy, overcast sky\") rather than *how* the camera is capturing it.\n*   It prioritizes literary description over technical specification, which is the opposite of what was requested.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption (Following the Instructions)\n\nTo illustrate the difference, here is a caption that correctly follows the instructions, assuming some common visual details for such a shot:\n\n> **\"From a low angle, the camera executes a slow, smooth tilt upward to reveal the top of the lighthouse. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the weathered lighthouse in sharp focus in the midground while the rainy sky in the background remains softly blurred.\"**\n\n**Why this example is good:**\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** Specifies the starting point (\"From a low angle\").\n*   **Movement:** Uses the specific term \"tilt upward\" and describes its speed and steadiness (\"slow, smooth\").\n*   **Focus:** Details the \"shallow depth of field\" and clearly defines the focus plane (\"lighthouse in sharp focus in the midground,\" \"sky...softly blurred\").\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It includes all the necessary technical details without unnecessary words, perfectly matching the prompt's requirements.",
