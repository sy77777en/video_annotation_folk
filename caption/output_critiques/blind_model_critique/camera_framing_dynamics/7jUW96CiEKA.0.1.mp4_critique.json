    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres well to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"positioned above water at a level angle\" is correct. The camera is very close to the water's surface and is aimed straight ahead, not tilted up or down.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field\" is a perfect description. The bird (midground) is in sharp focus, while the distant background is clearly blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** \"The camera remains completely static\" is correct. There is no panning, tilting, or any other movement.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete according to the instructions, which wisely advise omitting default states for conciseness.\n*   It correctly identifies and includes all the non-default, notable characteristics: the specific height/angle, the shallow depth of field, and the static nature of the shot.\n*   It correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is regular), **lens distortion** (there is none), and **Dutch angle** (the horizon is level), just as the instructions recommend.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the provided rules very effectively:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs all the necessary technical information into two clear sentences without unnecessary words.\n*   **Focus on Configuration:** The primary focus is on the camera's setup (height, angle, focus, movement).\n*   **Static Shot Rule:** It follows the rule \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static.\"\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses the specific terminology requested, such as \"level angle,\" \"midground,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement\nThe final phrase, \"capturing a bird flying low over the water,\" describes the *content* of the video rather than the camera configuration. While this is not a major issue and adds helpful context, a caption that adheres *strictly* to the prompt would focus only on the technical aspects.\n\n**Excellent Caption:**\n> The camera is positioned above water at a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field. The camera remains completely static.\n\n**Your Caption (also excellent, with added context):**\n> The camera is positioned above water at a level angle, focusing on the midground with a shallow depth of field. The camera remains completely static, capturing a bird flying low over the water.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by being accurate, concise, and including all relevant details while omitting unnecessary ones. The minor inclusion of content description is acceptable and makes the caption more readable for a general audience.",
