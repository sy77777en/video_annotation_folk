    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent starting point but contains a significant factual error and lacks the detail and precision required by the instructions. While it correctly identifies the video speed and primary camera movement, its description of the focus is incorrect, and it omits other important configuration details.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"This slow-motion...\"**: **Correct.** The video is clearly in slow motion, emphasizing the graceful movement of the musician's hands.\n*   **\"...eye-level video...\"**: **Inaccurate.** The camera is positioned lower than the subject's eyes. It is more accurately described as **chest-level** or **level with the piano keyboard**, which places the viewer on the same plane as the action (the hands playing).\n*   **\"...maintains a deep focus...\"**: **Incorrect.** This is the most significant error. The video uses a **shallow depth of field**, not a deep one. The background (window, room) is visibly blurred, which serves to isolate the subject (the pianist and the piano) and draw the viewer's attention to him. Deep focus would mean that both the foreground, midground, and background are all in sharp focus.\n*   **\"...smoothly dollies forward...\"**: **Correct.** The camera executes a very smooth, stable forward movement toward the subject, which is a dolly shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is too brief and misses several key descriptive points required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** It fails to mention that the shot uses a **level angle** (the camera is not tilted up or down).\n*   **Focus Details:** Beyond misidentifying the depth of field, the caption misses a crucial detail. As the camera dollies forward, the focus is actively adjusted to keep the musician perfectly sharp. This is a form of **focus tracking**. The instructions specifically ask for a description of focus changes, and this was omitted.\n*   **Focus Plane:** The caption does not specify that the focus is on the **midground**.\n*   **Steadiness:** While \"smoothly\" implies it, the instructions ask for a description of steadiness. Explicitly stating the camera is **steady** or **stable** would be more complete.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption follows some instructions but fails on others:\n\n*   **Followed:**\n    *   It correctly identified the altered **video speed** (slow-motion).\n    *   It correctly identified the primary **camera movement** (dolly).\n    *   It adhered to the conciseness rule by correctly omitting mentions of lens distortion and Dutch angle, as neither is present.\n\n*   **Not Followed:**\n    *   It provided an inaccurate description of the **camera height** and **focus**.\n    *   It failed to provide a complete description of the **focus**, missing the shallow depth of field, the focus plane, and the dynamic focus tracking.\n    *   It failed to describe the **camera angle**.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n**\"This slow-motion video is captured from a steady, chest-level camera at a level angle. Utilizing a shallow depth of field, the shot keeps the pianist in the midground in sharp focus against a softly blurred background. The camera performs a slow, smooth dolly forward, tracking focus to maintain perfect clarity on the musician as it moves closer.\"**",
