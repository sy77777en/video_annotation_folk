    "pre_caption": "An eye-level, level-angle shot zooms in on the woman in the blue hoodie. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Due to the video's low resolution, the focus is somewhat soft, with the characters appearing clearer than the slightly blurred background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The characters in the video are relatively clear, but the background is slightly blurred. The overall low resolution of the video makes it difficult to determine the camera's focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the eye-level angle and the unsteady, handheld nature of the shot, it makes a critical error by conflating low resolution with soft focus. The \"slightly blurred background\" is not a result of low resolution but rather a deliberate, shallow depth of field, with the focus plane locked on the woman in the midground. The low resolution should be described separately as a general lack of sharpness or pixelation across the entire frame. Furthermore, the term \"zooms in\" is imprecise; the subtle shift in perspective and parallax between the woman and the background suggests the camera is performing a slow dolly-in (physically moving forward) rather than an optical zoom. The caption also misses a secondary movement: as the camera dollies in, it performs a slight, corrective pan to the right to keep the woman centered in the frame as she subtly shifts her position. A more accurate description would specify a slow, handheld dolly-in with a concurrent pan, maintaining a shallow depth of field on the subject to isolate her from the environment.",

The camera movement is slightly unsteady, contributing to the dynamic feel of the scene. The focus is deliberately set with a shallow depth of field, keeping the woman in sharp focus against a slightly blurred background.
