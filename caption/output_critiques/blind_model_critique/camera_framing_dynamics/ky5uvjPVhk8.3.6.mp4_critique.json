    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly pans and moves left, focusing on the garden and water features, ensuring a steady and clear view of the surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning left and moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the general movement and steady nature of the shot, it oversimplifies several key cinematic elements that could be present. The description of the camera movement as a simple \"pan and move left\" is likely inaccurate; a more sophisticated shot might involve a slow, counter-clockwise arc or a combination of trucking left while simultaneously dollying backward to reveal more of the garden's scale. The assertion of a constant \"deep focus and a large depth of field\" might also be misleading. A more compelling video would likely start with a shallow depth of field, focusing on a foreground element like a stone lantern or a water droplet on a leaf, and then execute a smooth rack focus to the midground water features as the camera moves, guiding the viewer's eye through the space. Furthermore, the caption states the camera \"maintains a level angle\" at \"eye level,\" but the video could be more dynamic, perhaps starting at eye-level and then subtly pedestaling down as it moves, ending in a more contemplative low-angle shot of the pond. Finally, the caption omits any mention of video speed; the tranquil subject matter strongly suggests the use of slow-motion to enhance the serene atmosphere, a crucial detail that is missing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera begins at eye level, capturing the scene with a dynamic and sophisticated movement. It executes a slow, counter-clockwise arc, combining a trucking left with a dolly backward to reveal the garden's expansive scale. Initially, the focus is shallow, highlighting a foreground element like a stone lantern or a water droplet on a leaf. As the camera moves, a smooth rack focus transitions to the midground water features, guiding the viewer's eye through the space. The angle subtly shifts from eye level, pedestaling down to conclude with a contemplative low-angle shot of the pond. The use of slow-motion enhances the serene atmosphere, providing a tranquil and immersive viewing experience.",
