    "pre_caption": "This is a very smooth, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire dark scene sharp. It appears to move slightly backward, subtly pulling away from the figure in the spotlight.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The background doesn’t provide enough context to clearly define the motion, but it appears that the camera moves slightly backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, concise, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery detail mentioned in the caption correctly describes the video:\n*   **\"very smooth\"**: The camera movement is exceptionally steady and fluid, without any shake or jitter.\n*   **\"eye-level shot with a level angle\"**: The camera is positioned directly in front of the subject, not looking up or down, and at a height that corresponds to a person's natural line of sight.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire dark scene sharp\"**: The subject and the floor they are on are both in sharp focus. There is no visible background/foreground blur, which is characteristic of a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"move slightly backward, subtly pulling away\"**: This accurately describes the slow, gentle dolly-out movement. The camera is physically moving away from the subject, making them smaller in the frame.\n\n### 2. Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while remaining concise, just as the instructions requested:\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It covers height (`eye-level`), angle (`level angle`), movement (`move slightly backward`), and focus (`deep focus`).\n*   **Movement**: It effectively describes the movement's type (dolly out, described as \"pulling away\"), steadiness (\"very smooth\"), and speed (\"slightly,\" \"subtly\").\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption correctly omits details that are not present, as per the instructions. It doesn't mention:\n    *   **Video Speed**: Because it's at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: Because there is none.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: Because the horizon is level.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: Because the focus is static.\n*   **Clarity**: The language is descriptive and easy to understand (e.g., \"pulling away from the figure\") without relying solely on technical jargon, making it both informative and accessible.",
