    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward and downward to shift focus from one floor to the next, then slowly advances to reveal finer details of the interior.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, concise, and successfully captures the most important aspects of the shot—the focus and the complex camera movement. However, it could be slightly more complete by incorporating a few specific terms from the instructions regarding camera angle and height.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the events in the video.\n\n*   **\"With a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp...\"**: **Correct.** The foreground (upper floor railing), midground (lower floor), and background (far wall) are all in sharp focus throughout the shot. This is a perfect description of deep focus.\n*   **\"...the camera smoothly moves backward and downward...\"**: **Correct.** The camera performs two simultaneous movements: it moves away from the initial subject (dollying backward) and descends vertically (pedestaling downward). The term \"smoothly\" accurately describes the steadiness of the motion.\n*   **\"...to shift from one floor of the structure to the one below.\"**: **Correct.** This accurately describes the purpose and result of the first part of the camera movement.\n*   **\"It then slowly advances to reveal the details of the lower level's interior.\"**: **Correct.** After descending, the camera's primary motion is forward (dollying in or \"advancing\"). \"Slowly\" is an accurate descriptor of the speed.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but omits a few details requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **Included:**\n    *   **Focus:** Correctly identifies the \"deep focus.\"\n    *   **Movements:** Describes the translation (backward, downward, forward), steadiness (\"smoothly\"), and speed (\"slowly\"). It also clearly explains the purpose of the movements.\n    *   **Temporal Order:** Correctly separates the movement into two distinct phases (\"moves backward and downward... It then... advances\").\n\n*   **Omitted:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The instruction asks to specify the angle. The shot begins from a **high angle** (looking down at the lower floor) and transitions to a more **level angle** as it descends. This detail is missing.\n    *   **Camera Height:** While the \"downward\" movement implies a change in height, the caption doesn't use the specific terminology from the instructions (e.g., transitioning from an upper level to a lower one). This is a minor omission, as the context is clear, but adding it would increase adherence.\n    *   **Technical Movement Terms:** The caption uses descriptive words like \"moves backward\" and \"advances,\" which are perfectly clear. However, the instructions also provide technical terms like **dolly** and **pedestal**, which could be used for greater precision.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the core principles of the instructions, particularly conciseness.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is brief and effective, avoiding unnecessary words.\n*   **Omission of Standard Features:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all standard/absent in the video, just as the instructions advise.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses clear, informative language as requested.\n\nThe main area for improvement is in incorporating the specific terminology for **camera angle** and **height**, which were explicitly requested.\n\n### Final Verdict and Improved Version\n\nThe caption is excellent and functional as is. For a version that is 100% compliant with the detailed instructions, the missing elements of angle and height should be included.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> With a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp, the camera smoothly moves backward and downward to shift from one floor of the structure to the one below. It then slowly advances to reveal the details of the lower level's interior.\n\n**Improved Caption (for maximum adherence):**\n> With a deep focus keeping the entire scene sharp, the camera starts at a **high angle** and smoothly **dollies backward while pedestaling downward** to transition between floors. Now at a **level angle**, it slowly **dollies forward** to reveal the details of the lower level's interior.",
