    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, concise, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery detail in the caption correctly describes the video:\n*   **\"camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is held at a height and angle consistent with a person walking and looking straight ahead.\n*   **\"deep focus and a large depth of field\"**: This is correct. The person in the midground, the path, and the buildings and trees in the background are all in sharp focus.\n*   **\"The camera moves slowly forward, following a person from behind\"**: This accurately describes the camera's movement. It is tracking the subject while also dollying forward. The description \"slowly\" is particularly insightful, as the person is gradually getting smaller, indicating the camera is moving forward at a slower pace than the subject.\n*   **\"The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking\"**: This is a precise description of the handheld camera motion, which has the natural wobble of someone walking.\n\n### 2. Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while omitting irrelevant details, as instructed:\n*   **Required Elements**: It covers camera height (`eye level`), angle (`level angle`), focus (`deep focus`), and a detailed description of movement (type: `following`/`moves forward`, speed: `slowly`, steadiness: `unsteady with noticeable shaking`).\n*   **Omitted Elements**: It correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or a **Dutch angle**, as these are all standard or absent in the video. This demonstrates a good understanding of the conciseness rule in the instructions.\n*   **Movement Description**: The description of the movement is comprehensive, covering its direction, purpose (`following a person`), and quality (`unsteady`).\n\n### 3. Conciseness\nThe caption is efficient and well-written. It conveys all the critical technical aspects of the shot in two clear sentences without any unnecessary words. The phrase \"deep focus and a large depth of field\" is slightly redundant, as they mean the same thing, but it is still clear and doesn't detract from the overall quality.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and concise by excluding default settings.",
