    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, moving smoothly forward through an abandoned hallway. As it progresses, the camera elevates to eye level, maintaining a level angle. The focus remains deep, capturing the details of the graffiti-covered walls and debris. The movement is steady and fluid, enhancing the exploration of the corridor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key aspects of the video, such as the deep focus and steady movement. However, it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding camera movement and misses an opportunity to be more complete by describing the lens distortion.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The description of the camera height and its change is incorrect.\n    *   **\"The video begins with the camera at hip level...\"**: The camera height appears to be closer to a standard **eye-level** or chest-level throughout the entire shot, consistent with a person walking. \"Hip level\" would be noticeably lower.\n    *   **\"...the camera elevates to eye level...\"**: This is the most significant error. The camera **does not elevate**; it maintains a consistent height as it moves forward. This type of vertical movement is called a pedestal, and it is not present in the video.\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **\"...moving smoothly forward through an abandoned hallway.\"**: This is correct. The movement is a forward dolly.\n    *   **\"...maintaining a level angle.\"**: This is correct. The camera is not tilted up or down.\n    *   **\"The focus remains deep...\"**: This is correct. Both the foreground (floor, nearby walls) and the background (end of the hall) are in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"The movement is steady and fluid...\"**: This is a key feature of the video and is described accurately. The stability suggests the use of a gimbal or digital stabilization.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but omits a few details required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Lens Distortion:** The video is shot with a wide-angle lens, which creates noticeable **barrel distortion**. Straight vertical lines, like door frames, appear to curve outwards near the edges of the frame. This is a key characteristic of the camera's configuration and should have been mentioned.\n*   **Missing - Specific Terminology:** While \"moving smoothly forward\" is understandable, the instructions encourage more technical terms. The movement is a **dolly forward**. Using this term would make the description more precise.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Good Adherence:**\n    *   The caption correctly omits any mention of **video speed** and **Dutch angle**, as neither is present, following the instruction to be concise.\n    *   It successfully describes the **purpose** of the movement (\"enhancing the exploration of the corridor\").\n*   **Needs Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction asks for a description of **camera configuration**, which includes the lens. By not mentioning the wide-angle lens and its distortion, the caption fails to fully describe the configuration.\n    *   It fails to use the specific movement terminology (e.g., dollying, tracking) provided in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and incorporates the missing details, adhering more closely to the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a steady, eye-level height, the camera dollies forward at a walking pace through a derelict hallway. The use of a wide-angle lens creates slight barrel distortion at the edges of the frame. The camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene from the foreground debris to the far end of the corridor in sharp detail, creating a smooth and immersive exploration.\"**",
