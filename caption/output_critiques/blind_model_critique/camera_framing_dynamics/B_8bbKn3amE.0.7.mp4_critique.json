    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone performs a visually pleasing maneuver, smoothly flying forward with slight clockwise and counterclockwise rolls. As it approaches the person in red, it transitions into a quick counterclockwise arc around them.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the technical and descriptive requirements outlined in the instructions. It successfully balances being informative with being readable.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical elements.\n\n*   **\"smooth, aerial high-angle shot\"**: Correct. The camera movement is fluid and stabilized (smooth), it is clearly filmed from a drone (aerial), and it is looking down on the subject (high-angle).\n*   **\"varying Dutch angle caused by camera rolling\"**: Perfectly accurate. The horizon is intentionally tilted, and this tilt changes as the camera rotates along its lens axis (rolling). This is the precise definition of the movement.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp\"**: Correct. Both the foreground elements (the mountain peak) and the background elements (distant mountains and clouds) are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"flying forward with slight rolls\"**: Accurate. The initial movement is a forward dolly, and it is combined with the rolling motion described earlier.\n*   **\"transitioning into a quick counterclockwise arc around a person\"**: Correct. The camera's path changes from a linear forward motion to a circular one, moving counterclockwise around the person on the peak.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete according to the instructions, including all relevant information while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included:**\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** \"aerial high-angle\" covers both aspects perfectly.\n    *   **Movements:** It comprehensively describes the steadiness (\"smooth\"), the types of movement (\"flying forward,\" \"rolls,\" \"arc\"), the direction (\"counterclockwise\"), the complexity (a combination of movements), and the purpose (circling a subject).\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus\" is correctly identified.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The presence and nature of the \"varying Dutch angle\" are noted.\n\n*   **Correctly Omitted (as per instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is necessary.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no significant barrel or fisheye distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the specific guidelines.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into just three sentences without feeling dense or overly technical.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., \"high-angle,\" \"Dutch angle,\" \"camera rolling,\" \"deep focus,\" \"arc\").\n*   **Descriptive Clarity:** It clearly explains the sequence of events: the initial state and movement, followed by the main maneuver. The phrase \"caused by camera rolling\" is a great example of explaining *why* a visual effect is happening.\n*   **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity:** The phrase \"visually pleasing maneuver\" is slightly subjective. While it accurately describes the feel of the shot, a more objective alternative could be \"complex\" or \"dynamic.\" However, this is a very minor point, and it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the technical description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate in its analysis, complete in its scope, and uses the correct terminology to create a description that is both technically precise and easy to understand.",
