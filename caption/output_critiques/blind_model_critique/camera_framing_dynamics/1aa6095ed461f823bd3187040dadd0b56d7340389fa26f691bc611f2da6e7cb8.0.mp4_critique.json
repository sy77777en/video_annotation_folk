    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant technical error and a confusing description of the camera's position. While it correctly identifies the angle and focus, it misidentifies the primary camera movement, which is a critical element according to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"high-angle camera\"**: **Accurate.** The camera is positioned above the keyboard and angled downwards, which constitutes a high-angle shot.\n    *   **\"smoothly\"**: **Accurate.** The camera movement is steady and fluid, with no noticeable shaking or jitter.\n    *   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: **Accurate.** The background (a lamp and wall) is significantly blurred, isolating the hands and keyboard.\n    *   **\"focused on the midground\"**: **Accurate.** The plane of sharp focus is clearly on the hands and the keys they are interacting with, which represents the midground of the scene.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"at eye level\"**: **Inaccurate and Contradictory.** The phrase \"high-angle camera at eye level\" is confusing. An \"eye-level\" shot typically implies the camera is at the subject's eye height and looking straight. A \"high-angle\" shot is by definition positioned *above* the subject's eye level and looking down. In this video, the camera is slightly elevated relative to the keyboard, but it is not at a person's eye level. A better description would be \"slightly elevated\" or simply letting \"high-angle\" describe the shot.\n    *   **\"zooming in\"**: **Inaccurate.** This is the most critical error. The camera is not **zooming** (changing its focal length); it is **dollying in** (physically moving forward). You can tell it's a dolly because the perspective and the relationship between foreground and background objects shift as the camera moves closer. A zoom would simply magnify the center of the frame without changing the perspective. The instructions specifically differentiate between these two movements.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption attempts to be concise, as instructed, but in doing so, it omits some useful details and includes an incorrect one.\n\n*   It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angles, as none are present.\n*   It covers the camera angle, a (flawed) description of height, movement type, steadiness, depth of field, and focus plane.\n*   It could have been more complete by specifying the **speed** of the movement (e.g., \"slowly\") and using the correct term for the movement (**dolly in**).\n\n#### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption follows some instructions well but fails on a key point.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which aligns with the instructions.\n*   **Informative Description:** It fails to be fully informative due to the inaccuracies. The distinction between a dolly and a zoom is a fundamental aspect of cinematography that the instructions explicitly ask to be identified correctly.\n*   **Terminology:** It fails to use the correct terminology (\"dollying\") provided in the instructions, opting for the common but incorrect term \"zooming.\"\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately reflects the video and adheres strictly to your instructions:\n\n**A high-angle shot smoothly and slowly dollies in, maintaining a shallow depth of field with the focus fixed on the hands typing in the midground.**",
