    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, focusing on a person holding a book in the foreground. It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the person sharp while blurring the background. The camera moves slightly from left to right, tracking the person from the side. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving left to right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate and captures the key visual elements of the video well. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, concise, and covers most of the essential aspects required by the instructions. It correctly identifies the camera's position, focus, and general movement. However, it could be improved by using more specific terminology from the instructions and adding a few missing details.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy: **Excellent**\nEverything stated in the caption is correct.\n*   **Camera Position:** It is indeed at **eye level** with a **level angle**.\n*   **Focus:** The video clearly employs a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the person in the foreground sharp while blurring the background.\n*   **Movement:** The camera does move from **left to right** to track the person, and the movement is **slightly unsteady**, characteristic of a handheld shot.\n\n#### Completeness: **Good**\nThe caption is informative but misses a few details that would make it fully comprehensive according to the instructions.\n*   **Movement Type:** The caption describes the movement as \"moves slightly from left to right, tracking the person.\" While \"tracking\" is correct in its purpose, the instructions provide the specific term **trucking** for side-to-side camera movement. Mentioning this would add technical precision.\n*   **Movement Speed:** The instructions ask for the speed of the movement. In this case, the camera moves **slowly**. Adding this detail would make the description more complete.\n*   **Focus Dynamics:** The caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field but doesn't mention **focus tracking**. The focus actively adjusts to keep the moving subject sharp, which is a dynamic element worth noting.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions: **Very Good**\nThe caption follows the spirit and most of the rules of the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids mentioning elements that are not present (e.g., regular video speed, no lens distortion, no Dutch angle), which is exactly what the instructions requested.\n*   **Terminology:** This is the main area for improvement. While the language used is clear, incorporating more of the specific technical terms provided in the instructions (like **trucking** and **focus tracking**) would demonstrate a higher level of adherence.\n*   **Structure:** The description is logical and easy to follow.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption for Excellence\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that incorporates the feedback above to be more complete and technically precise, fully adhering to all instructions.\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n> Shot at eye-level with a level angle, the video uses a shallow depth of field to keep the foreground subject in sharp focus. The camera slowly **trucks right** to track the person, exhibiting a slightly unsteady handheld motion. The focus also dynamically **tracks** the subject to maintain sharpness against the blurred background.",
