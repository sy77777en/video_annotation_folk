    "pre_caption": "The video captures an aerial view of a bridge and urban scenery from a cable car. The camera maintains a level angle and deep focus, ensuring clarity across the scene.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This video likely captures a bridge and the surrounding urban scenery from the perspective of a cable car. The camera moves forward along the cable car's path, highlighting the bridge's intricate structure.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the rules of conciseness and detail.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **\"aerial view... from a cable car\"**: This correctly identifies the camera's high position and the context of the shot.\n*   **\"level angle\"**: The camera is indeed pointed straight ahead, parallel to the horizon, not tilted up or down.\n*   **\"deep focus\"**: This is perfectly described. All elements, from the nearby cable car window frame to the distant buildings, are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"moves smoothly forward along the cable car's path\"**: This accurately captures the single, continuous dolly/tracking motion.\n*   **\"minimal shaking\"**: The movement is very stable, with only slight, natural vibrations, making this description precise.\n\n### Completeness: Excellent\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information as required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not needed.\n\n*   **Included Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** Covered with \"aerial view\" and \"level angle.\"\n    *   **Movements:** The type (\"forward\"), steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"minimal shaking\"), and purpose (\"emphasizing the bridge's structure\") are all included.\n    *   **Focus:** The depth of field is clearly stated as \"deep focus.\"\n\n*   **Correctly Omitted Elements (as per instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so no mention of rack focus was needed.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions were described.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect understanding of the instructions' intent.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is only three sentences long but packs in all the critical information about the camera's configuration and movement without any filler.\n*   **Clarity:** It uses clear, descriptive language (e.g., \"along the cable car's path\") that is easy for anyone to understand, avoiding overly technical jargon.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** The caption's strength lies in what it *doesn't* say. By omitting mentions of normal speed and lack of distortion, it remains focused and concise, exactly as the instructions direct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is an outstanding example of how to apply the given instructions. It is a precise, well-written, and efficient description that captures the essential technical and aesthetic qualities of the shot. No improvements are necessary.",
