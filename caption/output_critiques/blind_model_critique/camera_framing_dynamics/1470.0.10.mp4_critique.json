    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward while panning left to track a person in white from behind.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is good, but it can be improved by being more complete and precise according to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on a person in white with a shallow depth of field. It moves forward smoothly while panning left to track the person from behind, ensuring minimal shaking.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\nEverything stated in the caption is factually correct.\n*   **\"eye level\" and \"level angle\":** Correct. The camera is held at a standard height and is not tilted up, down, or sideways.\n*   **\"focusing on a person in white with a shallow depth of field\":** Correct. The subject is in white, and the background is clearly out of focus.\n*   **\"moves forward smoothly\":** Correct. The camera is advancing along the path.\n*   **\"panning left to track the person\":** Correct. The camera rotates left to follow the subject's movement across the frame.\n*   **\"minimal shaking\":** Correct. The shot is very stable, likely achieved with a gimbal or other stabilizer.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Good but Lacks Detail\nThe caption covers the main points but misses some specific details requested in the instructions.\n*   **Missing Movement Type:** The camera isn't just moving forward (dollying) and panning. It is also moving sideways to the left (trucking) to maintain its distance and position relative to the subject. The combination of these movements is what creates the \"tracking\" shot.\n*   **Missing Focus Plane:** The instruction asks to specify the focus plane (foreground, midground, background). The caption correctly identifies a shallow depth of field but doesn't state that the focus is locked on the **midground** subject.\n*   **Missing Focus Change Description:** The camera is actively keeping the moving subject in focus. This is a form of **focus tracking**, which could be mentioned for greater completeness.\n*   **Missing Movement Speed:** The instruction asks to describe the speed of movement. The caption implies a steady speed with the word \"smoothly,\" but specifying that it's a \"walking pace\" would be more descriptive.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Very Good\nThe caption does an excellent job of following the core principles of the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon.\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, as none are present, just as the instructions advised.\n*   **Clarity:** The description is clear and easy for a general audience to understand.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is an improved version of the caption that incorporates the missing details while remaining concise.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\nFrom an eye-level, level-angle position, the camera focuses on a person in the **midground** with a shallow depth of field. It smoothly tracks the subject at a walking pace by **moving forward and trucking left**, combined with a **pan left**. The shot is very steady, and the focus remains locked on the person as they move.",
