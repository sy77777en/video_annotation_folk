    "pre_caption": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward smoothly while panning left, focusing on the street and pedestrians, then continues straight ahead with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera moves forward while panning left, then continues straight ahead.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect fit for the video and follows the instructions precisely.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as being at **eye level** with a **level angle**, which accurately reflects the perspective of someone walking down the street.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The description of **\"deep focus and a large depth of field\"** is spot-on. Everything from the immediate foreground (the street) to the distant background (buildings and sky) is sharp and clear.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is highly accurate. The camera does indeed **move forward smoothly** (a dolly-in) **while panning left** at the beginning to keep the pedestrians and the intersection in view. It then correctly notes that the camera **continues straight ahead** for the remainder of the shot.\n*   **Steadiness:** The mention of **\"minimal shaking\"** is accurate, as the footage is very stable, likely due to a gimbal or digital stabilization.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects requested in the instructions: camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and a detailed breakdown of the movement (type, direction, steadiness, and temporal order).\n*   It correctly identifies the two distinct phases of movement: the initial combined dolly/pan and the subsequent pure dolly.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon while remaining informative. It perfectly follows the rule to omit standard attributes, making no mention of the normal video speed, the lack of lens distortion, or the absence of a Dutch angle.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses clear and descriptive language (\"moves forward,\" \"panning left\") that aligns with the technical terms (dolly, pan).\n*   **Structure:** The description of the movement is presented in the correct temporal order, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary response to the prompt. It is accurate, comprehensive without being verbose, and strictly adheres to all the provided guidelines.",
