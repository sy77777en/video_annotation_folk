    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Position:** The description of the camera being at **eye level** with a **level angle** is correct. The camera is positioned straight-on, not looking up or down at the subject, and the horizon is not tilted.\n*   **Focus and Depth:** The caption accurately identifies that the focus is on the **man in the midground** and that the shot uses a **shallow depth of field**, which is evident from the sharp subject and the blurred background.\n*   **Camera Movement/Steadiness:** The phrase **\"fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\"** is a nuanced and highly accurate description. The camera does not pan, tilt, or dolly, but there is a subtle, high-frequency shake, which the caption correctly captures without overstating it.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects present in the video as required by the instructions: camera height, angle, focus plane, depth of field, and steadiness.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as lens distortion, altered video speed, or dynamic focus changes, which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise, packing all the necessary information into a single, clear sentence without any redundant wording.\n*   **Informative Description:** It provides a comprehensive technical summary of the shot's configuration.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** As instructed, it does not mention that the video is at regular speed or that there is no lens distortion, which helps keep the description focused and efficient.\n*   **Clarity on Movement:** It clearly distinguishes between the lack of *intentional* movement (like panning or tilting) and the camera's physical state (slightly unsteady), which demonstrates a high level of observational detail.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is precise, technically correct, and written with excellent clarity and conciseness.",
