    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is good and provides a solid foundation, but it can be improved for greater accuracy, conciseness, and adherence to the specific terminology requested in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Accurate:** The descriptions of **camera height** (\"eye level\"), **camera angle** (\"level angle\"), **focus** (\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"), and **steadiness** (\"smooth, minimal shaking\") are all accurate and well-described.\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of movement as \"moves slowly forward... focusing on the person\" is correct in a general sense. However, it uses generic language instead of the specific cinematographic term. Since the camera is following a subject, the correct term is **tracking**.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **What it does well:** The caption successfully covers the key required elements: height, angle, focus, depth of field, and movement characteristics (speed, steadiness, purpose). It also correctly omits details about normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, as instructed.\n*   **What's missing:** The primary omission is the failure to use the specific movement term **\"tracking\"** which is explicitly defined in the instructions as \"following a subject.\" This is the most significant point of deviation from the instructions.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is reasonably concise, but could be tightened. For example, \"maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead\" is slightly redundant. \"Level angle\" implies looking straight ahead on the horizontal plane. Similarly, \"employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp\" explains the term, but a more professional caption might just state \"deep focus\" or \"large depth of field.\"\n*   **Use of Terminology:** The caption uses some correct terms (\"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus\") but misses the most important one for describing the movement (\"tracking\" or \"dollying\"). The instructions specifically ask for these terms.\n\n### Summary of Feedback\n\nThe caption is good because it is clear, informative, and captures the general essence of the shot. However, it is not *great* because it fails to use the precise technical vocabulary for camera movement that the instructions explicitly requested, making it less professional and technically accurate than it could be.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption Examples\n\nHere are two alternative captions that more closely follow the instructions:\n\n**Option 1 (More Detailed):**\n> The camera is positioned at an eye-level, level angle. It smoothly **tracks** forward, following a person down a corridor with minimal shaking. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\n\n**Option 2 (More Concise and Professional):**\n> From a level, eye-level position, the camera smoothly **tracks** a person forward down a corridor. A large depth of field keeps all elements in sharp focus.\n\nThese revised versions are better because they replace the generic \"moves forward focusing on\" with the precise term **\"tracks,\"** directly fulfilling a key requirement of the instructions and making the description more professional and efficient.",
