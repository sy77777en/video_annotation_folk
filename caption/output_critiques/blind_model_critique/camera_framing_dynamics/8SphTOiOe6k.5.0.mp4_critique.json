    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans right while slightly moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres very well to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects:\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle...\"**: This is correct. The camera is held at a height consistent with a person walking, and the horizon is kept level without any noticeable upward, downward, or Dutch angle.\n*   **\"...capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field.\"**: This is a perfect description. Both the people in the immediate foreground and the buildings far in the background are in sharp focus, which is characteristic of a large depth of field.\n*   **\"It smoothly pans right while slightly moving forward...\"**: This accurately identifies the compound camera movement. The camera is rotating right (panning) to follow the street while also moving forward along the sidewalk (a subtle dolly). The term \"smoothly\" is also correct.\n*   **\"...focusing on the people and storefronts in the foreground.\"**: While the technical focus is deep, the *compositional* focus (the main subject of interest) is indeed the activity on the sidewalk. This is a good observation.\n*   **\"The movement is steady with minimal shaking.\"**: This is a crucial and accurate detail. The shot is not static, but it's far too smooth for typical handheld walking. It suggests the use of a gimbal or advanced image stabilization, and \"steady with minimal shaking\" captures this perfectly.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption does an excellent job of including the necessary information while correctly omitting what isn't present, as per the instructions.\n\n*   **What's Included:** Camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, movement type (pan, dolly/forward movement), and steadiness.\n*   **What's Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable barrel or fisheye distortion, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is fixed and deep; there are no rack focuses or focus tracking, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\nThe only minor detail that could be added for even greater completeness would be the **speed of movement** (e.g., \"at a slow, walking pace\"), but its omission keeps the caption concise and is not a significant flaw.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into two clear, readable sentences.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"depth of field,\" and \"pans.\"\n*   **Describes Configuration:** It successfully describes the video's and camera's configuration as requested.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by not mentioning normal video speed, the absence of distortion, or the lack of a Dutch angle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt. It is technically accurate, concise, and demonstrates a clear understanding of both the visual content and the specific descriptive rules. It effectively balances providing detailed information with maintaining readability.",
