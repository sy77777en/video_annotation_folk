    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Lacking background information, it's difficult to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** Lacking background information, it's difficult to determine the camera angle, but it appears to be high angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting down and panning left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the high angle and shallow depth of field, it oversimplifies the camera work and misses key dynamic details. The description of a static \"high-angle view\" is incomplete, as the \"tilt down\" movement implies a dynamic shift in the camera's angle, likely transitioning towards a more level perspective relative to the paper. The movement is described as a \"pan left,\" but if the camera is following a hand as it writes across the page, the motion is more accurately a *tracking* or *trucking* shot to the left, physically moving parallel to the action rather than just rotating. Furthermore, \"maintaining focus\" is less precise than specifying it as *focus tracking*, where the focus plane actively follows the tip of the pen, keeping the newly written numbers sharp while the rest of the page remains blurred. The caption could also be improved by noting the slow, deliberate speed of the camera movement, which serves the purpose of mimicking a reader's careful observation, and by mentioning the presence of subtle *vignetting* at the corners, a common characteristic for lenses creating such an extremely shallow depth of field.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a dynamic camera movement starting from a high-angle view with an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly tilts down, transitioning towards a more level perspective relative to the paper, and executes a tracking shot to the left, following a hand as it writes across the page. The focus tracking technique is employed, keeping the tip of the pen and the newly written numbers sharp while the rest of the page remains blurred.
