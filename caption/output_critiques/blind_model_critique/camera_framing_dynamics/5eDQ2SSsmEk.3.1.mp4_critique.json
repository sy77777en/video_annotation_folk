    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Lacking background information, it's difficult to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** Lacking background information, it's difficult to determine the camera angle, but it appears to be high angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting down and panning left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a very good and accurate description of the video, adhering closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **High-angle view:** Correct. The camera is positioned above the paper, looking down at it.\n*   **Extremely shallow depth of field:** Correct. This is accurately described, as only the plane of the paper is in sharp focus, while elements closer to or farther from the camera are heavily blurred.\n*   **Focusing on the midground:** Correct. The paper with the numbers constitutes the midground of the shot, and it is the clear plane of focus.\n*   **Smoothly tilts down and pans left:** Correct. The camera performs a combined rotational movement, tilting vertically downward while also panning horizontally to the left. The movement is steady and not shaky.\n*   **Maintaining focus on the paper's content:** Correct. This accurately describes that there is no rack focus; the focus plane remains on the paper as the camera moves, effectively tracking the subject.\n\n**2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is perfectly concise. It avoids mentioning standard attributes like **regular video speed**, the **absence of lens distortion**, and the **lack of a Dutch angle**, which is exactly what the instructions requested.\n*   **Required Elements:** The caption successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"high-angle\"\n    *   **Focus (Depth & Plane):** \"extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground\"\n    *   **Movements (Type, Steadiness, Direction):** \"smoothly tilts down and pans left\"\n    *   **Focus Changes:** \"maintaining focus\"\n*   **Terminology:** The caption uses precise and appropriate terminology (e.g., \"high-angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"tilts,\" \"pans\"), demonstrating a clear understanding of the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions, providing a description that is simultaneously concise, technically accurate, and highly informative. It successfully captures the key visual and technical characteristics of the shot without any unnecessary information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a high-angle view with an extremely shallow depth of field, concentrating on the midground where handwritten numbers on a paper are clearly visible. The camera executes a smooth tilt down and pan left, consistently maintaining focus on the paper's content.",
