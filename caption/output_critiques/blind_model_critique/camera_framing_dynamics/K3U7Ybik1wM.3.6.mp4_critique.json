    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but fails on several key points, making it a poor description of the video. It correctly identifies that the shot is static and has a deep focus, but it makes a significant error in describing the camera angle/height and completely omits the most important feature of the video: the time-lapse.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"This is a static shot...\"**: This is **accurate**. The camera's position and framing do not change throughout the video.\n    *   **\"...from a low...\"**: This is **accurate**. The camera is positioned low to the ground, approximately at the level of the coffee table.\n    *   **\"...deep focus, keeping the entire room in sharp detail.\"**: This is **accurate**. The foreground rug, midground chair, and background bookshelf are all in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"...eye-level angle.\"**: This is **inaccurate and contradictory**.\n        *   **Height vs. Angle:** The caption incorrectly conflates height (\"eye-level\") with angle. The camera's **height** is low, not eye-level.\n        *   **Angle:** The camera's **angle** is a **level angle**, meaning it is parallel to the ground. An \"eye-level angle\" is not a standard term, but if interpreted as an angle from eye-level height, it is factually wrong. The phrase \"low, eye-level\" is a direct contradiction.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and misses the most critical element of the video.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The caption completely fails to mention that this is a **time-lapse** video. This is the most prominent feature of the shot, demonstrated by the rapid movement of light and shadows across the floor and furniture. The instruction explicitly requires specifying altered video speed.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption fails to correctly identify the **level angle** of the camera.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption does not adhere well to the instructions.\n\n*   **Successes:**\n    *   It correctly identified the camera's lack of movement (\"static\").\n    *   It correctly described the focus (\"deep focus\").\n    *   It remained concise.\n\n*   **Failures:**\n    *   It failed to follow the instruction to \"Provide a concise yet **informative** description,\" as it left out the most informative detail (the time-lapse).\n    *   It failed to specify the **video speed** as required.\n    *   It provided an inaccurate and confusing description of the **camera angle** and **height**, failing to use the correct terminology outlined in the instructions (e.g., *level angle*, *low height*).\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a static, time-lapse shot from a low height and a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire room, from the foreground to the background, in sharp detail.\"**",
