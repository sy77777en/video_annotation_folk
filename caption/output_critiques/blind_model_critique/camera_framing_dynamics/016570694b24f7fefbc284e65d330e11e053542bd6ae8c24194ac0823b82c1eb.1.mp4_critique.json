    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video features a cup of coffee, employing ultra-shallow focus and focus tracking. As the camera moves closer, the cup of coffee always remains relatively sharp. However, in the end, when the camera slightly pulls away, the entire image becomes out of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, positioned at a high angle, moves forward and downward to approach the coffee cup while tilting up to level its angle. The footage is also somewhat shaky as if someone shoots it using a handheld camera.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical and visual elements:\n*   **Camera Angle & Movement:** It correctly identifies the starting **high-angle** and the combined movement of moving **forward and downward** while **tilting up** to end at a near **level angle**. This complex, multi-axis movement is described perfectly.\n*   **Focus:** The description of an **ultra-shallow** depth of field is spot on, as the background is heavily blurred. The use of **focus tracking** to keep the cup sharp during the approach is also correctly identified.\n*   **Steadiness:** The observation that the camera is **slightly shaky** is accurate, correctly implying a handheld or simulated handheld motion.\n*   **Ending:** The caption correctly notes the final action where the camera pulls away slightly and the entire image goes **out of focus**.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption includes all the necessary information as required by the instructions, while correctly omitting what isn't present:\n*   **Required Elements:** It successfully covers camera angle, height change (implied by \"downward\"), complex movements (translation and rotation), steadiness, and dynamic focus changes (tracking and pulling to out-of-focus).\n*   **Omitted Elements:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is normal), **lens distortion** (which is absent), and **Dutch angle** (which is not used). This demonstrates a strong understanding of the conciseness rule.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and content guidelines precisely:\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is efficient and avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"moves forward\" instead of \"dollies in\"), making it both informative and easy to read.\n*   **Temporal Order:** The description of the camera's actions follows the sequence of events in the video, starting with the initial framing, describing the main movement, and concluding with the final focus pull.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and unambiguous, leaving no doubt about the camera's configuration and behavior throughout the shot.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is a thorough, precise, and well-structured description of the video's cinematography.",
