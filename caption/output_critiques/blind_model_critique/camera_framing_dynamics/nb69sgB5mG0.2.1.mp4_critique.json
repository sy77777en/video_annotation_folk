    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, capturing a diver's jump. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, initially at a level angle, then smoothly tilts down to a high angle to track the diver as they leap off the platform. The camera zooms in on the diver, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking, and the diver becomes larger in the frame as they descend into the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera smoothly tilts down to track the diver jumping into the water, zooming in on them during the first half as they leap off the platform.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tilting downward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the captioning instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the video, such as the slow motion, the general camera movement, and the focus. However, it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the camera angle and could be more precise with its description of the camera's movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"The video is in slow motion, capturing a diver's jump.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The diver's movements are clearly much slower than real-time, which is the definition of slow motion.\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at an overhead level...\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The camera is positioned high above the subject, looking down. \"Overhead level\" is an accurate description of its height.\n\n*   **\"...initially at a level angle, then smoothly tilts down to a high angle...\"**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This is the main error. The camera starts at a **high angle** (looking down on the subject) and maintains a high angle throughout the shot. A *level angle* would mean the camera is at the same height as the subject, looking straight at them. The camera never does this. It only **tilts further down** from its initial high-angle position.\n\n*   **\"...to track the diver as they leap off the platform.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The purpose of the camera movement is to follow the diver.\n\n*   **\"The camera zooms in on the diver...\"**\n    *   **Plausible, but could be more precise.** The diver does get larger in the frame. This could be a digital or optical zoom. However, the change in perspective suggests the camera is also physically moving closer to the subject as it moves down. A more accurate term would be a **crane down and forward**. While \"zoom\" describes the effect, it may not be the correct technical movement.\n\n*   **\"...maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** Both the diver in the midground and the water in the background are kept in sharp focus throughout the shot.\n\n*   **\"The movement is very smooth, with no shaking...\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The shot is perfectly stabilized.\n\n*   **\"...and the diver becomes larger in the frame as they descend into the water.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** This is an accurate observation that reinforces the \"zoom\" or \"crane forward\" movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is reasonably complete but misses an opportunity for greater precision as encouraged by the instructions.\n\n*   **What it covers well:** Video speed, camera height, a description of movement (tilt, zoom), steadiness, purpose (tracking), and focus.\n*   **What could be added/improved:** The instructions mention `craning` (circling vertically). The movement in the video is a perfect example of a **crane down**. Combining this with the tilt and forward motion would provide a more complete and professional description (e.g., \"the camera smoothly cranes down and forward, tilting to follow the action\").\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be **concise yet informative**.\n*   It correctly identifies and specifies the **video speed** (`slow motion`).\n*   It correctly omits mentions of **lens distortion** and **Dutch angle**, as they are not present, adhering to the rule \"there is no need to mention these.\"\n*   It attempts to describe **camera angle, height, and movement**, but as noted, the angle description is inaccurate.\n*   It correctly describes the **focus and depth of field**.\n*   It describes the **steadiness** of the movement.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and incorporates more precise terminology, fully adhering to the instructions:\n\n**The video is in slow motion. Shot from an overhead level at a continuous high angle, the camera smoothly cranes down and forward, tilting to track a diver as they jump. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the diver and the water sharp throughout the very steady movement.**",
