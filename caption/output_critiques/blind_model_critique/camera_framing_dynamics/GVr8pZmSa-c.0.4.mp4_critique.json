    "pre_caption": "The camera starts above water and moves to an aerial level, maintaining a high angle looking down. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the midground where a ship is being tossed by rough seas. The camera moves backward and upward while tilting down, exhibiting significant unsteady shaking throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts above water and then moves to an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward and upward with significant shaking, tilting down from silghtly high angle to a high angle.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but contains one significant inaccuracy**. It successfully captures the camera's movement, angle, and instability with concise and accurate language. However, its description of the depth of field is incorrect, which is a critical element of the camera's configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy\n\n*   **Highly Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The description `starts above water and moves to an aerial level, maintaining a high angle looking down` is perfect. It correctly identifies the starting position, the upward trajectory, and the consistent high-angle perspective.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The phrase `moves backward and upward while tilting down` is an excellent and precise summary of the complex camera motion. It correctly identifies the dolly out, the pedestal/crane up, and the compensatory downward tilt.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The description `exhibiting significant unsteady shaking throughout the movement` is spot-on. The severe instability is a defining characteristic of the shot, and the caption captures it well.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Depth of Field:** The caption states the camera `employs a shallow depth of field`. This is incorrect. The video actually exhibits a **deep depth of field**. Both the turbulent waves in the foreground and the ship in the midground are in sharp focus. In a shallow depth of field shot, the foreground waves would be significantly blurred. The clarity of the entire scene is what emphasizes the overwhelming and detailed chaos of the storm.\n\n#### Completeness\n\n*   **What it covers well:** The caption effectively covers camera height, angle, movement (translation and rotation), and steadiness, as required by the instructions. It also correctly identifies the focus plane (`on the midground where a ship is...`).\n*   **What could be added (minor points):**\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** While not strictly mandatory, the instructions suggest describing the purpose of the movement if relevant. Here, the backward and upward movement serves to reveal the scale of the storm and the vulnerability of the ship within the vast, violent ocean. Adding this would enhance the description.\n    *   **Movement Terminology:** The caption uses clear descriptive terms (\"backward and upward\"). For even greater technical precision, it could use terms like \"dollying out\" and \"craning up,\" but the current wording is perfectly understandable and effective.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise and well-written, successfully avoiding unnecessary information (like regular video speed or lack of lens distortion), as instructed.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses appropriate terminology for camera angle, height, and movement, with the notable exception of \"shallow depth of field.\"\n*   **Structure:** The caption is logically structured, first establishing the camera's position and angle, then discussing focus, and finally describing the movement.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracy and incorporates minor improvements for completeness:\n\n**\"From a high angle, the camera starts at a high level above the water and moves backward and upward toward an aerial level, tilting down to keep the midground ship in frame. The shot uses a deep depth of field, keeping the entire chaotic scene from the foreground waves to the background in sharp focus. This movement, which reveals the immense scale of the rough seas, is marked by severe and constant unsteady shaking.\"**",
