    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead through a car windshield. It moves forward along the road, with slightly unsteady motion and some shaking, simulating the perspective from inside a moving vehicle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the background (the road and vehicles ahead) in focus while the foreground (dashboard and windshield) remains out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the background.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions. Here is a thorough breakdown of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is mostly accurate and well-written, but it contains a critical error in describing the depth of field, which misrepresents a key visual characteristic of the video. While it correctly identifies what is in focus, it uses the wrong technical term to describe the effect.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:**\n    *   **Camera Position:** \"positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead through a car windshield\" is perfectly accurate.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** \"moves forward along the road, with slightly unsteady motion and some shaking, simulating the perspective from inside a moving vehicle\" is an excellent and precise description of the camera's translation, steadiness, and purpose.\n\n*   **What it gets wrong:**\n    *   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The statement \"The camera uses a shallow depth of field\" is **incorrect**.\n        *   **Shallow depth of field** means only a very narrow plane of the image is in focus, and the rest (typically the background) is significantly blurred. This is used to isolate a subject.\n        *   This video demonstrates a **deep depth of field** (or deep focus). Almost the entire scene, from the midground (the car directly ahead) to the background (distant buildings and traffic lights), is sharp and in focus.\n        *   The caption correctly observes that the foreground (dashboard) is out of focus and the background is in focus, but it incorrectly labels this effect as \"shallow.\" The focus is simply set to infinity (or far away), leaving the very close foreground blurry, while maintaining sharpness across a large distance—the definition of deep focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most relevant aspects required by the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** Angle and height are covered.\n    *   **Movements:** Translation, steadiness, and purpose are well-described.\n    *   **Focus:** It attempts to cover depth of field and the focus plane.\n\n*   Following the instructions, it correctly omits details that are not present, such as:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n    *   **Complex Movements:** There are no pans, tilts, zooms, etc.\n\nThe caption is incomplete only in the sense that its description of the focus is flawed and therefore not a complete or correct account.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary words.\n*   **Informative Description:** It is informative about position and movement but provides misinformation about the focus.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses terms like \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"depth of field\" as requested, but critically misuses \"shallow depth of field.\" The instruction places a strong emphasis on correctly identifying these technical aspects, and the caption fails on this point.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately reflects the video according to the instructions:\n\n**The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, simulating a driver's perspective through a car windshield. It moves forward with the vehicle, exhibiting slight unsteadiness and shaking from the road. The focus is fixed on the background, creating a deep depth of field that keeps the road and traffic ahead sharp, while the foreground elements like the dashboard and windshield are out of focus.**",
