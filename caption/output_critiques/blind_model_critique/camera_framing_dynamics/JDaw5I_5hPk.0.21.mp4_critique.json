    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant contradiction that makes it misleading. While it correctly identifies the camera angle and depth of field, its description of the camera's movement is fundamentally flawed.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the **\"high-angle\"** perspective, the **\"shallow depth of field,\"** the focus on the **\"stream in the midground,\"** and the **\"blurred\"** foreground foliage. These observations are correct.\n*   **Inaccurate and Contradictory:** The most significant error is describing the shot as **\"static\"** and then immediately contradicting this by stating the camera is **\"slightly unsteady.\"** A static shot, by definition, has no movement. This shot is not on a tripod; it is handheld, and the unsteadiness *is* the camera's movement. The two terms are mutually exclusive, making the description confusing and inaccurate.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but omits key details and fails to properly categorize the information it does include.\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of movement is incomplete. Instead of classifying the shot as \"static,\" it should have described the nature of the unsteady movement. The instructions ask for a description of \"steadiness\" and \"complexity.\" The movement here is a slight, continuous, handheld wobble, which is a key characteristic of the shot that is not properly conveyed.\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption mentions the angle (high) but not the height. Based on the perspective, it appears to be shot from **eye-level** or **chest-level**, which could have been included for a more complete description.\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):** The caption correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angles, as none are present. This adheres to the instruction to be concise and not mention absent features.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to fully adhere to the instructions, particularly regarding the description of camera movement.\n\n*   **Instruction:** \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the type, direction, steadiness, and speed of movement.\"\n*   **Failure:** The caption misidentifies the shot as static. It should have followed the instructions for a moving camera, describing the \"slight unsteadiness\" as a **\"slight handheld wobble\"** or **\"minimal shaking,\"** which is the primary form of movement in the video.\n*   **Instruction:** \"Provide a concise yet informative description...\"\n*   **Failure:** The internal contradiction (\"static\" yet \"unsteady\") makes the description uninformative and confusing, failing this core requirement. A good description must be clear and unambiguous.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more accurately and completely follows the given instructions:\n\n**\"This is a high-angle, handheld shot from approximately eye-level, exhibiting a slight but continuous wobble. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field with the focus fixed on the flowing stream in the midground, leaving the foliage in the foreground heavily blurred.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Accurate Movement:** It correctly identifies the shot as \"handheld\" and describes the movement as a \"slight but continuous wobble,\" resolving the contradiction.\n*   **Complete:** It adds the camera height (\"approximately eye-level\") for a more thorough description.\n*   **Clear and Concise:** It clearly communicates all the key visual elements without ambiguity.\n*   **Follows Instructions:** It correctly categorizes the shot as moving and describes that movement as instructed.",
