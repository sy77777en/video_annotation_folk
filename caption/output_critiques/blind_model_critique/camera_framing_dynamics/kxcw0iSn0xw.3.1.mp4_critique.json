    "pre_caption": "The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow playback speeds. The camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead, with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Lacking background information, making it hard to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **partially accurate but contains a critical error** regarding camera movement. While it correctly identifies the video speed, angle, and focus, its failure to describe the primary camera motion makes it a poor and misleading description of the video.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The caption accurately identifies the `speed ramp effect` and correctly describes it as a transition between `fast and slow playback speeds`. This is the most prominent stylistic choice in the video.\n    *   **Camera Angle & Focus:** The description of a `level angle`, `deep focus`, and `large depth of field` is accurate. The camera looks straight ahead, and nearly everything from the foreground umbrella to the distant background lights remains in sharp focus.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Movement:** This is the most significant error. The caption claims, **\"The camera remains fixed... with no intentional movement.\"** This is factually wrong. The camera is clearly and intentionally moving forward throughout the entire shot, following the person walking. This movement is a **dolly forward** or **tracking shot**.\n    *   **Steadiness:** While the caption correctly notes the camera is `slightly unsteady`, it misses the context. The unsteadiness is not random; it's the natural, rhythmic bobbing and swaying of a **handheld** camera being carried by someone who is walking. Describing it as simply \"unsteady\" without mentioning the forward motion is misleading.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and misses several key descriptors required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Camera Height:** The caption fails to specify the camera's height (e.g., `eye-level` or `chest-level`), which is a required element.\n*   **Missing Movement Description:** As noted above, the caption completely omits a description of the primary camera movement (`dolly forward`, `tracking`). It also fails to describe the **purpose** of the movement, which is to create a first-person perspective of walking down the street.\n*   **Missing Movement Characteristics:** The instructions ask for the type, direction, steadiness, and speed of movement. The caption only mentions steadiness and incorrectly negates the existence of any intentional movement.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Positive Adherence:**\n    *   The caption successfully uses specific terminology from the instructions, such as `speed ramp`, `level angle`, and `deep focus`.\n    *   It correctly adheres to the conciseness rule by omitting mentions of non-existent features like lens distortion or a Dutch angle.\n\n*   **Negative Adherence:**\n    *   The caption fails to fulfill the core instruction of providing an \"informative description of the... camera's configuration\" because it fundamentally misrepresents the camera's motion. The instruction to describe movements like `tracking`, `dollying`, and their `purpose` was ignored in favor of an incorrect \"fixed\" description.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately and completely follows the provided instructions:\n\n**From a handheld, eye-level perspective, the camera dollies forward, creating a first-person point-of-view of walking down a wet city street at night. The shot has a natural, rhythmic unsteadiness consistent with walking. The video utilizes a speed ramp, starting in fast-motion, transitioning to slow-motion, and then returning to fast-motion. The camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.**",
