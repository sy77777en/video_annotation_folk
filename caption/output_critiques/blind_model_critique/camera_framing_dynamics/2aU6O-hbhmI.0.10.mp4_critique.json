    "pre_caption": "The video is a fast-motion aerial shot with noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera starts at a low angle and transitions to a high angle, incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone performs complex arcs and rolls smoothly above a construction site in a city at dusk, providing a dynamic view with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A fast-motion video with forward playback speed slightly faster than real-time (1x–3x).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** A drone shot with complex manuvers flying above a construction site in a city at dusk. It perform complex arcs and rolls movements to showcase the dynamic view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of the required elements, and adheres perfectly to the instructions for conciseness and clarity. It successfully distills a complex, dynamic shot into a single, informative sentence.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is extremely accurate in its description of the video's technical and aesthetic properties.\n\n*   **\"fast-motion aerial shot\"**: Correct. The movement of the clouds and traffic on the ground is unnaturally fast, indicating the video has been sped up. The camera's perspective is clearly from the air, making it an aerial shot.\n*   **\"noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward\"**: Correct. The wide-angle lens creates significant barrel/fisheye distortion, which is most visible in the curvature of the buildings and horizon, especially at the edges of the frame.\n*   **\"starts at a low angle and transitions to a high angle\"**: Correct. The shot begins with the camera looking up towards the buildings (a low angle relative to them) and then swoops over the construction site, looking down (a high angle).\n*   **\"incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling\"**: Perfectly accurate. The camera continuously rolls, causing the horizon to tilt dramatically from side to side, creating a dynamic and disorienting Dutch angle that changes throughout the shot.\n*   **\"maintains deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. Everything from the nearby structures to the distant city skyline is in sharp focus, which is characteristic of a large depth of field, common in aerial and action videography.\n*   **\"The drone performs complex arcs and rolls smoothly\"**: Correct. This is an excellent summary of the FPV (First-Person View) drone's movement. It's not a simple pan or tilt; it's a fluid, multi-axis flight path involving curved trajectories (arcs) and rotations along the lens axis (rolls). The movement is very smooth, indicating good piloting and/or digital stabilization.\n*   **\"above a construction site in a city at dusk\"**: Correct. The setting, subject, and time of day are all identified accurately.\n*   **\"providing a dynamic view with minimal shaking\"**: Correct. The purpose of the complex movement is to create a dynamic and engaging perspective, and despite the acrobatic maneuvers, the footage is stable with no noticeable jitter.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption successfully covers all relevant points from the instruction list without including unnecessary information.\n\n*   **Video Speed**: Addressed (\"fast-motion\").\n*   **Lens Distortion**: Addressed (\"fisheye distortion\").\n*   **Camera Angle**: Addressed (\"low angle and transitions to a high angle\").\n*   **Camera Height**: Addressed (\"aerial shot\").\n*   **Movements**: Fully addressed. It correctly identifies the primary movements (\"arcs and rolls\"), their complexity (\"complex\"), steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"minimal shaking\"), and purpose (\"providing a dynamic view\").\n*   **Focus**: Addressed (\"deep focus with a large depth of field\").\n*   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe. The caption correctly treats it as such.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the given guidelines perfectly.\n\n*   **Conciseness**: It is a single, well-constructed sentence that packs a large amount of information without being wordy. It follows the instruction to omit details that are not present (e.g., it doesn't state \"there is no rack focus\" or \"the video is not time-reversed\").\n*   **Informative Description**: It provides a thorough technical breakdown of the shot's configuration, as requested.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It correctly uses specific terms like \"fast-motion,\" \"fisheye distortion,\" \"Dutch angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"arcs,\" and \"rolls.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is precise, comprehensive, and efficient. There are no corrections or improvements needed.",
