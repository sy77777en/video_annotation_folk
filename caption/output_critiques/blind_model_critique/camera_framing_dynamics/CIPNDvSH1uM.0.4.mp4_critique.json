    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving leftward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good. It is accurate, concise, and effectively follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **\"Slightly unsteady, eye-level perspective\"**: This is correct. The camera has a minor, natural shake consistent with being in a moving vehicle, and it is positioned at the same height as the driver's head.\n*   **\"trucks left, tracking the driver\"**: This accurately describes the camera's movement. It moves horizontally from right to left (**trucking left**) parallel to the road, and its purpose is to keep the driver centered in the frame (**tracking**).\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping both the driver and the background scenery in clear view\"**: This is a perfect description of the focus. The driver in the midground and the trees in the background are both sharp and clear, which defines a deep depth of field.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or **Dutch angle**, as these are all standard/absent in the video, adhering to the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It successfully covers the required elements:\n    *   **Height**: \"eye-level\"\n    *   **Movement**: \"trucks left,\" \"tracking\"\n    *   **Steadiness**: \"slightly unsteady\"\n    *   **Focus**: \"deep focus\"\n*   **Terminology**: It uses the precise technical terms requested, such as \"trucks,\" \"tracking,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement\n*   The caption implies a **level angle** by describing the shot as \"eye-level\" and \"from the side,\" but it doesn't explicitly use the term \"level angle\" as specified in the instructions. While not a significant omission, adding it would make the description perfectly complete.\n\n**Revised Caption for 100% Completeness:**\n\n\"From a slightly unsteady, **level angle** and eye-level perspective, the camera trucks left, tracking the driver in the car from the side. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the driver and the background scenery in clear view.\"\n\nEven without this minor addition, the original caption is excellent and fulfills the core requirements of the prompt exceptionally well.",
