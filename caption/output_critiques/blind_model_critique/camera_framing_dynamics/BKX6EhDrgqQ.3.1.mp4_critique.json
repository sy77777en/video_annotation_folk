    "pre_caption": "The camera is at eye level, initially at a level angle, then tilting to a high angle as it moves smoothly forward and downward to approach the checkout screen of the McDonald's self-service kiosk. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground checkout screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward and downward to approach the checkout screen of the McDonald's self-service kiosk.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera motion and shallow depth of field, it lacks precision and overlooks several likely visual details. The description of the movement as \"forward and downward\" could be more technically specific, for instance, as a \"smooth dolly in combined with a pedestal down.\" The assertion that the camera maintains a \"consistent level angle\" is questionable; as the camera moves downward, a slight \"tilt down\" would almost certainly be required to keep the checkout screen properly framed. The description of the focus is also too simplistic; during a dolly-in, the focus must be actively adjusted to maintain sharpness on the screen, so specifying that the camera is \"focus tracking\" the screen would be more accurate. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the initial framing—for example, the shot might begin as a medium over-the-shoulder view before moving into the close-up, and this starting context is crucial. Finally, the movement might not be purely linear; a subtle \"counter-clockwise arc\" could be used as the camera pushes in to create a more dynamic reveal of the final price, a detail that is currently missing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera starts with a medium over-the-shoulder view, initially at eye level, and performs a smooth dolly in combined with a pedestal down, subtly tilting down to maintain the checkout screen in frame. As it moves, the camera follows a slight counter-clockwise arc to dynamically reveal the final price on the McDonald's self-service kiosk. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, actively focus tracking the screen to ensure sharpness throughout the movement.",
