    "pre_caption": "This shot begins with a smooth, quick camera movement from a worm's-eye view of the sky and buildings. The camera tilts down to an eye-level, level-angle perspective and then moves forward rapidly down a street. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a worm's-eye view angle (looking directly up) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts down and then moves forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the deep focus and general direction of movement, it mischaracterizes the initial camera action and misses several key visual details. A \"tilt down\" from a \"worm's-eye view\" would point the camera at the ground, not achieve an \"eye-level\" perspective; the video likely features a more complex \"crane up\" or \"pedestal up\" movement that simultaneously \"tilts down\" to transition from looking at the sky to looking straight ahead. Furthermore, describing the movement as merely \"quick\" and \"rapid\" is an understatement; the smooth, fast-paced motion down the street is characteristic of a *hyper-lapse*, which would be a more precise term for the altered video speed. Given the initial worm's-eye view of tall buildings, the caption also omits the significant *barrel distortion* from a wide-angle lens, which causes the vertical lines of the architecture to curve outwards at the start of the shot. Lastly, the claim that the \"entire scene\" remains \"sharp\" during the rapid forward dolly is questionable; while the depth of field is deep, significant *motion blur* would likely affect objects in the foreground and periphery as they rush past the camera, contrasting with the sharper elements in the center of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with a dynamic camera movement featuring a crane up or pedestal up action combined with a tilt down, transitioning from a worm's-eye view of the sky and tall buildings to an eye-level perspective. The camera then accelerates into a hyper-lapse, moving rapidly down the street. The use of a wide-angle lens introduces noticeable barrel distortion, curving the vertical lines of the architecture outward at the start. While the scene maintains a deep depth of field, motion blur affects the foreground and peripheral objects as they rush past, contrasting with the sharper elements in the center of the frame.",
