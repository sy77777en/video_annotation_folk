    "pre_caption": "Positioned at ground level, the camera captures the field of yellow flowers from a high angle with a fixed Dutch tilt. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the flowers in the midground before performing a rack focus that blurs the entire scene. The camera tilts down slightly with some minor shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is tilting down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great example to work with. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but contains two key inaccuracies in its use of technical terminology. While it successfully identifies most of the key visual elements and follows the instructions for conciseness, the description of the camera angle and the type of focus change could be more precise.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **Strengths (What the caption gets right):**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"Positioned at ground level\" is accurate. The camera is very low, among the flowers.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** \"fixed Dutch tilt\" is perfect. The frame is clearly tilted and remains so throughout the shot.\n    *   **Depth of Field:** \"shallow depth of field\" is correct. The background is significantly blurred, isolating the subject flowers.\n    *   **Initial Focus:** \"initially focusing on the flowers in the midground\" is an accurate description of the starting focus plane.\n    *   **Camera Movement & Steadiness:** \"The camera tilts down slightly with some minor shaking\" is a precise and correct description of the camera's rotation and handheld quality.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement (What the caption gets wrong):**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The term **\"high angle\" is incorrect.** A high-angle shot implies the camera is positioned significantly *above* the subject, looking down on it. In this video, the camera is at the subject's level (or even lower than some of the taller flowers) and is simply tilting its \"gaze\" downward. A more accurate description would be a **level angle** with a downward tilt.\n    *   **Focus Change:** The term **\"rack focus\" is used incorrectly.** A rack focus is the act of shifting focus *from one subject to another* within the frame (e.g., from a person in the foreground to a person in the background). In this video, the focus shifts from the midground flowers to complete blurriness, with no new subject coming into focus. The correct term for this is a **\"pull to blur\"** or simply **\"defocusing.\"**\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions that are present in the video:\n    *   Camera Height (`ground level`)\n    *   Camera Angle (`high angle` - though inaccurate)\n    *   Dutch Angle (`fixed Dutch tilt`)\n    *   Focus & Depth (`shallow depth of field`, `focus on midground`, focus change)\n    *   Movement & Steadiness (`tilts down`, `minor shaking`)\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as lens distortion, altered video speed, or complex movements, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instruction**\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the overall goal of being a \"concise yet informative description.\"\n*   It correctly identifies and uses specific terminology like \"shallow depth of field,\" \"Dutch tilt,\" and \"tilts down.\"\n*   The primary failure in adherence is the inaccurate use of the terms \"high angle\" and \"rack focus,\" which goes against the instruction's emphasis on precise descriptions of camera configuration and movement.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracies while maintaining the structure and conciseness of the original.\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nPositioned at ground-level, the camera captures a field of yellow flowers with a shallow depth of field and a fixed Dutch tilt. The shot begins with the focus on the midground flowers, then the camera slowly tilts down with minor shaking while pulling focus to blur the entire scene.",
