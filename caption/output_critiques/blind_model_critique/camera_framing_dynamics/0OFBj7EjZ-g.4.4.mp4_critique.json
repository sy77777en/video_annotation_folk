    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves downward while slightly tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

The camera smoothly moves downward while slightly tilting up, maintaining focus on the pallets in the foreground.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It accurately identifies several key aspects of the shot but misses some specific details required by the instructions.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The description of \"focusing on the foreground with a shallow depth of field\" is perfectly accurate. The pallets in the front are sharp, while the background is clearly blurred.\n*   **Movement:** The caption correctly identifies the primary movements: the camera \"smoothly moves downward\" (a pedestal down) and simultaneously \"slightly tilting up\" to keep the subject centered.\n*   **Steadiness:** The word \"smoothly\" correctly describes the steady, controlled nature of the camera movement.\n\n**Completeness: Fair**\nThe caption is concise, but it omits several key descriptors requested in the instructions.\n*   **Missing - Camera Height:** The instructions explicitly ask for camera height (e.g., eye-level, hip-level). The caption fails to mention that the camera starts at roughly eye-level and moves down toward hip-level.\n*   **Missing - Movement Speed:** While \"smoothly\" implies a controlled pace, the instructions ask for speed. Adding that the movement is \"slow\" would make it more complete.\n*   **Incomplete - Camera Angle:** The caption states the camera has a \"level angle.\" This is only true at the beginning of the shot. A more complete description would note that it *starts* with a level angle and ends with an upward tilt.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Good**\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise and to omit details for features that are absent (like lens distortion, Dutch angle, or non-regular video speed).\n*   It correctly describes the focus plane, depth of field, and the combination of camera movements.\n*   However, it fails to adhere to the specific requirements for describing **camera height** and its changes, which was a key part of the prompt.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption:\n\nTo fully meet all the requirements of the instructions, the caption could be revised as follows:\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n\"Starting at approximately eye-level with a level angle, the camera smoothly and slowly pedestals down. It simultaneously tilts up to keep the subject centered, ending at around hip-level. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus locked on the pallets in the foreground.\"",
