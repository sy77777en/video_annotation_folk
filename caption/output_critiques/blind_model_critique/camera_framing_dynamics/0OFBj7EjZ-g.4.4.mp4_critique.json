    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera with a level angle, focusing on the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly moves downward while slightly tilting up, maintaining focus on the pallets in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves downward while slightly tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the basic camera motion, it lacks the specificity and detail required by the instructions. The description of the camera angle as \"level\" is only accurate for the beginning of the shot; as the camera moves downward and tilts up, it transitions into a \"low angle,\" a change that should be noted. The movement itself is imprecisely described as \"moves downward\"; a more technical term like \"pedestals down\" would be more accurate. The caption also omits several key visual elements from the imagined video: it fails to mention the initial camera height (e.g., \"starting from eye-level\"), the slow and steady speed of the movement, and the subtle barrel distortion visible at the edges of the frame, which suggests a wide-angle lens was used. Most importantly, it misses the purpose of the combined pedestal and tilt, which is to create a dynamic parallax effect, making the brightly lit, out-of-focus warehouse background appear to shift behind the sharply focused wooden pallets. A more comprehensive description would also specify that the focus plane is locked on the very front edge of the top pallet, keeping the wood grain and a printed label in crisp detail throughout the motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a camera positioned at eye-level, featuring a shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly pedestals down while transitioning from a level to a low angle, slightly tilting up to maintain focus on the pallets in the foreground. This movement is slow and steady, creating a dynamic parallax effect where the brightly lit, out-of-focus warehouse background appears to shift behind the sharply focused wooden pallets. The wide-angle lens introduces subtle barrel distortion at the edges of the frame. The focus plane is locked on the very front edge of the top pallet, keeping the wood grain and a printed label in crisp detail throughout the motion.",
