    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, straight-on angle, the camera focuses on the driver in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. Fixed to the front of the vehicle and facing the driver, the camera moves backward with the car, leading the subject from the front. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Midway through the shot, the camera zooms in on the driver's face, causing him to become larger in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, fixed at the front of the vehicle and facing the driver, moves backward with the car and zooms in on the driver's face midway through the video.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the mid-shot zoom, but its description of movement and camera placement could be more precise. Stating the camera \"moves backward with the car\" is confusing; since it's fixed to the vehicle, it is actually static relative to the driver. A better description would be that the camera is mounted in a fixed position relative to the subject, creating the effect of the background dollying away rapidly. The \"eye-level, straight-on angle\" is also likely inaccurate; if mounted on the hood, it would be a *low angle* from *hood-level*, looking slightly up at the driver. The caption also misses the subtle but present *barrel distortion* from the wide-angle lens, which makes the car's interior pillars appear to curve outwards at the edges of the frame. Lastly, the description of the zoom could be enhanced by specifying its purpose, for instance: \"Midway through, a slow digital zoom pushes in from a medium shot to a tight close-up on the driver's face, heightening the focus on his emotional state as he navigates traffic.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low angle at hood-level, the camera is mounted in a fixed position relative to the driver, creating the effect of the background rapidly dollying away. The use of a shallow depth of field keeps the driver in sharp focus while the background blurs. The wide-angle lens introduces subtle barrel distortion, causing the car's interior pillars to curve outward at the edges of the frame. Midway through the shot, a slow digital zoom transitions from a medium shot to a tight close-up on the driver's face, intensifying the focus on his emotional state as he navigates traffic.",
