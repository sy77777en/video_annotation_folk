    "pre_caption": "This is a time-lapse video of a plant growing. The camera is completely static, positioned at a high angle looking down at the plant. The actual camera height is unclear as the plant is inside a wooden box. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video played forward at a greatly accelerated speed (more than 3× real-time), showing time passing rapidly over a long period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Because the plant is inside a wooden box, the actual camera height is unclear.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a time-lapse and notes the static, high-angle camera position, it lacks the specific detail needed to fully describe the viewing experience. The claim of a \"completely static\" camera might be inaccurate; upon closer inspection, there appears to be a very slow, subtle digital zoom-out throughout the video, likely to keep the growing plant from exiting the top of the frame. The description of the camera angle as \"high\" is vague; it's more precisely a moderate high angle, positioned just above the planter box, not a dramatic overhead shot. The statement that the height is \"unclear\" is unhelpful; it would be better to describe its position relative to the subject. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the slight barrel distortion visible on the straight edges of the wooden box, suggesting a wide-angle lens was used. The \"deep focus\" is mostly accurate, but the wall in the background is noticeably softer than the plant and its container, a nuance worth mentioning. Most significantly, the caption omits the most dynamic visual element besides the plant's growth: the rapid cycling of light and shadow across the scene, which powerfully conveys the passage of time. A more comprehensive caption would also note that the plant is centrally framed and that a hand briefly enters the shot to water the soil.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video captures the growth of a plant from a moderate high angle, just above the planter box, with a subtle digital zoom-out to keep the plant centered as it grows. The camera employs a wide-angle lens, evident from the slight barrel distortion on the wooden box's edges. While the scene maintains deep focus, the background wall is softer compared to the sharpness of the plant and its container. The video dynamically showcases the rapid cycling of light and shadow, effectively illustrating the passage of time. The plant is centrally framed, and a hand briefly enters the frame to water the soil, adding a human touch to the scene.",
