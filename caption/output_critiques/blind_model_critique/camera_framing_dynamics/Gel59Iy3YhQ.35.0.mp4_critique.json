    "pre_caption": "From a high, aerial angle, the camera captures a 3D video game boss fight with a shallow depth of field that keeps the foreground action in focus. The camera tracks the player character while arcing around the central boss, first moving counterclockwise, then clockwise, and finally counterclockwise again. The shot is slightly unsteady, with noticeable shaking accompanying the boss's impacts on the ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera focuses on a fight in the square of a 3D game, tracking the main character's movements while keeping the boss centered in the frame. It arcs counterclockwise around the boss, then clockwise, and switches back to counterclockwise at the end. The camera shakes noticeably with each impact as the monster hits the floor.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect example of how to follow the instructions precisely and effectively.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so good:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **Angle and Height:** \"High, aerial angle\" is a perfect description. The camera is positioned high above the action and angled down, which fits both terms.\n*   **Focus:** \"Shallow depth of field that keeps the foreground action in focus\" is spot-on. The background is clearly blurred, while the player character, the boss, and the immediate arena floor are sharp.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the camera movement is exceptionally precise. It correctly identifies the dual actions of **tracking** the player and **arcing** around the boss. The detailed sequence of \"counterclockwise, then clockwise, and finally counterclockwise again\" perfectly matches the on-screen movement.\n*   **Steadiness:** It correctly notes that the shot is not perfectly steady (\"slightly unsteady\") and accurately identifies the cause: \"noticeable shaking accompanying the boss's impacts on the ground.\" This shows a high level of observational detail.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested by the instructions while correctly omitting what isn't present.\n*   **Included:** It covers camera angle, height, movement (tracking, arcing, steadiness, and purpose), and focus (depth of field and focus plane).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so this was correctly left out as per the instruction: \"if the video is at regular playback speed... there is no need to mention these.\"\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The camera is not tilted, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions flawlessly.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption packs a significant amount of technical detail into just three sentences. It avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice but uses precise technical terms like \"arcing\" and \"shallow depth of field\" correctly.\n*   **Clarity and Structure:** The description is logical and easy to follow. It starts with the static setup (angle, focus) and then describes the dynamic elements (movement, shaking).\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology (tracking, arcing, high angle, shallow depth of field) correctly and appropriately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is an exemplary caption. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the instructions, a keen eye for technical detail, and the ability to communicate complex information clearly and concisely. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to all provided guidelines.",
