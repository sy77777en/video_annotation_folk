    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect fit for the video and follows the instructions precisely.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n*   **\"static, slightly unsteady macro shot\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera does not perform any deliberate movements (panning, tilting, etc.), making it \"static.\" However, the minor, high-frequency vibrations are correctly identified as \"slightly unsteady,\" which is typical for a handheld macro shot. \"Macro\" accurately describes the extreme close-up nature of the video.\n*   **\"extremely shallow depth of field\"**: This is the most prominent visual characteristic of the video. The focus is limited to a very narrow plane, causing the background and even parts of the spider closer to the lens to be heavily blurred. The term \"extremely shallow\" is appropriate.\n*   **\"focusing sharply on the spider's face in the midground\"**: This correctly identifies both the subject of the focus (the spider's face and main eyes) and its position within the frame's depth (the midground, with the front legs in the foreground and the rest of the body/background behind it).\n\n### 2. Completeness & Conciseness\nThe caption masterfully balances being informative with being concise, as requested by the instructions:\n*   It includes all the **relevant and non-standard** features: camera steadiness, focus depth, and focus plane.\n*   It correctly **omits** information for default or absent features, which is a key part of the instructions:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible distortion, so it's correctly left out.\n    *   **Camera Angle/Height:** While one could add \"level angle\" and \"ground-level,\" the term \"macro shot\" in this context strongly implies a very low, close, and level perspective. Omitting these details makes the caption more concise without losing essential information.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** It addresses movement by describing it as \"static\" but \"unsteady,\" which is more precise than listing all the movements that *aren't* happening.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines perfectly:\n*   It provides a \"concise yet informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n*   It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground\").\n*   It adheres to the negative constraints by not mentioning regular speed, the absence of distortion, or the lack of a Dutch angle.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary model of how to apply the given instructions. It is technically precise, easy to understand, and focuses on the most important cinematic qualities of the shot.",
