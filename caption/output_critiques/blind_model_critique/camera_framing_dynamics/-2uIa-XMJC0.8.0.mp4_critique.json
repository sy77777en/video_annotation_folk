    "pre_caption": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, maintaining a deep focus and large depth of field.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera simulates an FPV view within a room, continuously panning and tilting to explore the surroundings. Toward the end, it shakes intensely as a person punches toward the viewer.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a high-quality description that is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions. It successfully balances being concise with being highly informative.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n\n*   **\"mild barrel distortion\"**: This is a perfect description. The vertical lines of the doorframe and shelves clearly bow outwards, but the effect is not extreme like a fisheye lens.\n*   **\"eye level with a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera's perspective is consistent with that of a person standing, and it looks straight ahead without tilting up or down at the horizon.\n*   **\"deep focus and large depth of field\"**: Correct. All elements in the frame, from the objects on the desk in the foreground to the wall in the background, remain sharp and in focus throughout the video.\n*   **\"simulates an FPV view\"**: This is an accurate and concise way to describe the first-person perspective.\n*   **\"continuously panning and tilting to explore the surroundings\"**: Correct. The camera's primary movements are rotational (panning left/right, tilting up/down) to look around the room.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady with some shaking, intensifying toward the end as the camera shakes intensely when a person punches toward the viewer\"**: This is a precise description of the camera's stability. The initial movement has a subtle, floaty unsteadiness, which escalates dramatically into a violent shake in reaction to the punch.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, covering all the relevant points from the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed. As per the instructions, this was correctly omitted.\n*   **Lens Distortion**: Present and correctly identified as \"mild barrel distortion.\"\n*   **Camera Angle & Height**: Both are correctly identified (\"level angle,\" \"eye level\").\n*   **Dutch Angle**: There is no Dutch angle, so it was correctly omitted.\n*   **Movements**: The caption thoroughly describes the movement:\n    *   **Type**: Panning and tilting are correctly named.\n    *   **Purpose**: \"to explore the surroundings\" is accurately stated.\n    *   **Steadiness**: The change in steadiness from \"slightly unsteady\" to \"intensely\" shaking is noted.\n*   **Focus**: The \"deep focus\" and \"large depth of field\" are correctly described. There are no focus changes (like a rack focus), so this was correctly not mentioned.\n*   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so there was no need to describe transitions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Conciseness**: The description is efficient and avoids unnecessary words. For example, \"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle\" combines two key points smoothly.\n*   **Informative Description**: It provides a rich, technical summary of the shot's construction.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It uses the precise terms requested in the instructions (e.g., `barrel distortion`, `level angle`, `eye level`, `deep focus`, `panning`, `tilting`).\n*   **Temporal Order**: It correctly describes the change in camera movement over time, noting that the shaking \"intensif[ies] toward the end.\"\n*   **Omission of Negatives**: It correctly leaves out mentions of normal video speed and the absence of a Dutch angle, as instructed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate in its analysis, complete in its coverage of required elements, and written with the specified conciseness and terminology. No improvements are needed.",
