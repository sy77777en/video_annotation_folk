    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in white, wearing a white hat, dancing in a room. The camera is positioned at eye level but uses a low angle, looking up at the subject. The footage is noticeably shaky, with the camera panning from right to left to follow the man's movements, creating motion blur. The focus appears deep, but the blurring from the strong camera and subject motion makes it difficult to determine clearly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video features a man dressed in white, wearing a white hat, dancing in a room. Strong camera movement and the subject’s motion create noticeable motion blur. It appears to be deep focus, but the blurring makes it difficult to determine clearly.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This noticably shaky footage captures a man wearing a white hat, appearing to party or dance, while panning from right to left to follow his movements.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject and the shaky, handheld nature of the shot, it could be significantly more precise and detailed. The description of the camera as \"eye level but uses a low angle\" is contradictory; the camera is actually held at a consistent *hip-level*, which is what creates the continuous *low angle* perspective, making the dancer appear more imposing. The description of movement as just \"panning\" is an oversimplification. The camera actively *trucks left and right* and *dollies in and out* to match the dancer's choreography, and at one point performs a rapid *counter-clockwise arc* around him during a spin. The caption also misses that the video employs a *speed ramp* into *slow-motion* to emphasize a specific jump, before returning to normal speed. Furthermore, the analysis of focus is inaccurate. The focus is not deep; it's a distinct *shallow depth of field*, keeping the dancer (midground) sharp while the room's background is heavily blurred. The blur is a combination of this shallow focus and the *motion blur* from the fast action, not just motion alone. The focus is also dynamic, actively *tracking* the subject as he moves toward and away from the lens, rather than being fixed. Finally, the use of a wide-angle lens is apparent from the slight *barrel distortion* that curves the vertical lines of the room's architecture when the camera moves quickly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a man dressed in white, including a white hat, dancing energetically in a room. The camera is consistently held at hip level, creating a low-angle perspective that makes the dancer appear more imposing. The footage is noticeably shaky, with the camera actively trucking left and right and dollying in and out to match the dancer's choreography. At one point, the camera performs a rapid counter-clockwise arc around the dancer during a spin. The video employs a speed ramp into slow-motion to highlight a specific jump before returning to normal speed. The focus features a shallow depth of field, keeping the dancer in sharp focus while the room's background is heavily blurred. This blur results from both the shallow focus and motion blur from the fast action. The focus dynamically tracks the dancer as he moves toward and away from the lens. Additionally, the use of a wide-angle lens is evident from the slight barrel distortion that curves the vertical lines of the room's architecture during quick camera movements.",
