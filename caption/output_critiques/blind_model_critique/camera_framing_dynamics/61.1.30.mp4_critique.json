    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in white, wearing a white hat, dancing in a room. The camera is positioned at eye level but uses a low angle, looking up at the subject. The footage is noticeably shaky, with the camera panning from right to left to follow the man's movements, creating motion blur. The focus appears deep, but the blurring from the strong camera and subject motion makes it difficult to determine clearly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video features a man dressed in white, wearing a white hat, dancing in a room. Strong camera movement and the subject’s motion create noticeable motion blur. It appears to be deep focus, but the blurring makes it difficult to determine clearly.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This noticably shaky footage captures a man wearing a white hat, appearing to party or dance, while panning from right to left to follow his movements.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but contains significant inaccuracies regarding key technical aspects, specifically camera height and depth of field. While it correctly identifies some elements like the camera shake and panning motion, its misinterpretations of other core concepts make it a poor description according to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nHere is a breakdown of the caption's accuracy, statement by statement:\n\n*   **\"The video features a man in white, wearing a white hat, dancing in a room.\"**\n    *   **Verdict: Accurate.** This is a correct description of the video's content.\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level but uses a low angle, looking up at the subject.\"**\n    *   **Verdict: Inaccurate and Contradictory.** This statement is logically flawed. If a camera is at the subject's eye level, it would produce a **level angle**, not a low one. The video clearly shows a **low angle** (looking up at the man). To achieve this, the camera must be positioned at a **low height**, such as **hip-level** or **chest-level**, and tilted upward. The caption correctly identifies the angle but incorrectly states the height.\n\n*   **\"The footage is noticeably shaky, with the camera panning from right to left to follow the man's movements, creating motion blur.\"**\n    *   **Verdict: Accurate.** This is the strongest part of the caption. It correctly identifies that the camera is **unsteady/shaky**, the primary movement is a **pan** to **track** the subject, and the direction is **right to left**. It also correctly notes the resulting **motion blur**.\n\n*   **\"The focus appears deep, but the blurring from the strong camera and subject motion makes it difficult to determine clearly.\"**\n    *   **Verdict: Inaccurate.** This is a critical error. The focus is **shallow**, not deep.\n        *   **Deep focus** would render both the subject (midground) and the background sharp and in focus.\n        *   In the video, the background is clearly out of focus and soft, which is the defining characteristic of a **shallow depth of field**. The intention is to isolate the dancer.\n        *   The caption writer has confused the overall blurriness (caused by motion and camera shake) with the concept of depth of field. While motion blur makes it hard to see fine detail, the soft, non-detailed background is a clear indicator of a shallow focus plane, not a deep one.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption attempts to cover the required points but misses some nuances and gets others wrong.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** **Covered (by omission).** The video is at regular speed, so not mentioning it is correct per the instructions.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** **Covered (by omission).** There is no noticeable distortion, so not mentioning it is correct.\n*   **Camera Angle:** **Partially Covered.** It correctly identifies a \"low angle\" but pairs it with an incorrect height.\n*   **Camera Height:** **Incorrectly Covered.** It states \"eye level\" when it is clearly \"hip-level\" or lower.\n*   **Movements:** **Well Covered.** It correctly identifies the pan, its purpose (tracking), and the unsteadiness. It could be slightly more descriptive by calling it a \"reactive\" or \"jerky\" pan to match the dancer's energy, but what's there is good.\n*   **Focus:** **Incorrectly Covered.** It misidentifies the depth of field as \"deep\" when it is \"shallow\" and misattributes the cause of the blur.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption follows the instruction to be concise.\n*   It uses some of the specified terminology (pan, low angle) but misuses others (eye level, deep focus).\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., time-lapse, Dutch angle).\n*   It fails to provide an *informative* description due to the significant inaccuracies.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a caption that accurately reflects the video and adheres to all instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a hip-level height at a low angle, the unsteady camera performs a reactive pan from right to left to track the dancer. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the focus on the subject in the midground, though significant motion blur is present due to the rapid camera and subject movement.\"**",
