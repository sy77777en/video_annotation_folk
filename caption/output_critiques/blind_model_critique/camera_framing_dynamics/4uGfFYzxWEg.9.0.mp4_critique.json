    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nWhile it is concise and captures the general action, it fails to include several key technical details required by the instructions, making it incomplete and not sufficiently informative.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of a \"smooth, slow\" movement on a \"bar chart\" is correct. The stated purpose, \"enhancing the viewer's attention to the details,\" is also accurate.\n*   **Inaccurate Terminology:** The caption identifies the movement as a \"zoom-in.\" However, the camera is physically moving forward through the 3D space, which is a **dolly-in**. A zoom changes the focal length of the lens, which would compress the space between the foreground and background bars. A dolly changes the camera's position, altering perspective as it moves past objects, which is what happens here.\n\n**2. Completeness (Major Issue):**\n\nThe caption is far too general and omits several specific points required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption fails to mention that the shot is filmed from a **high angle**, looking down on the chart.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field** to isolate the subject. The foreground bars are out of focus, the midground bars are sharp, and the background grid is soft. The caption's phrase \"steadily focuses on the chart\" is vague and does not describe the depth of field or the specific **focus plane (midground)**, which are crucial stylistic elements requested in the instructions.\n*   **Movement Specificity:** While it mentions the movement is a \"zoom-in,\" it misses the opportunity to be more precise by identifying it as a **dolly-in**.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption successfully adheres to the instruction for conciseness and correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., video speed alteration, lens distortion, Dutch angle).\n*   However, it fails to adhere to the core requirement of providing an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration,\" specifically ignoring the explicit instructions to describe **camera angle, camera height, and focus (depth, focus plane)**.\n\n### A Better Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more accurately and completely follows the given instructions:\n\n\"From a **high angle**, the camera performs a slow and steady **dolly-in** on a 3D bar chart. The shot maintains a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the **midground** of the chart in sharp focus to draw the viewer's attention to the central data points.\"",
