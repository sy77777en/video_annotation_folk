    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery statement in the caption is a precise and correct description of the video's technical aspects:\n*   **\"shot at eye level with a level camera angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned at a height and angle that mimics the natural perspective of a person standing and looking straight ahead at the subject. There is no upward or downward tilt.\n*   **\"maintaining a deep focus and large depth of field\"**: This is correct. Both the subject in the midground and the wall and door in the background are sharp and clearly visible, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera remains completely static, capturing the scene without any movement or shaking\"**: This is accurate. The frame is perfectly still throughout the entire video, with no panning, tilting, zooming, or even minor hand-held shakiness.\n\n### 2. Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows all the rules outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Covers Key Configurations**: It correctly identifies and describes the four most relevant characteristics of this specific video: camera height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary information. As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no visible distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video consists of a single, uninterrupted shot.\n*   **Proper Terminology**: It uses the specific terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"eye level,\" \"level camera angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"static.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It provides a concise yet fully informative description of the video's configuration by accurately identifying the key visual elements while correctly omitting default or absent features.",
