    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the requirements.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **good**. It is accurate, concise, and captures the two most prominent technical aspects of the shot: the camera movement and the focus. However, it is not fully complete according to the exhaustive list of requirements in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**. Everything it states is factually correct for the video provided.\n\n*   **\"The camera smoothly tilts up...\"**: This is a perfect description of the primary camera movement. It is a **tilt** (vertical rotation), and it is executed **smoothly** without any shake or wobble.\n*   **\"...revealing the 'V8' portion of the 'Flo's V8 Cafe' neon sign.\"**: This accurately describes the subject and the purpose of the movement. The tilt's function is to reveal the sign.\n*   **\"The shot maintains a deep focus...\"**: This is correct. There is no shallow depth of field; the entire sign, from the elements closest to the camera to those farther away, remains in sharp focus.\n*   **\"...keeping the entire sign sharp.\"**: This correctly clarifies what \"deep focus\" means in this context.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **incomplete** when measured against the full set of instructions. It omits several specified details.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** The caption implies a low angle by stating the camera \"tilts up,\" but it doesn't explicitly name it. The instruction asks to specify angles like *low angle* or *worm's eye*. This shot is a clear **low angle**.\n*   **Camera Height:** The instruction asks for height (e.g., *ground-level, hip-level, eye-level*). The camera appears to be at a **low-level**, possibly hip-level or lower, to achieve the dramatic upward angle. This is not mentioned.\n*   **Movement Speed:** While \"smoothly\" describes the quality of the movement, the instruction also asks for speed. The tilt is performed **slowly** and deliberately, which could be added for more detail.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the spirit of the instructions but misses some of the specific requirements.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption excels here. It is short and to the point.\n*   **Informativeness:** It successfully communicates the most important information about the shot's configuration (movement and focus).\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly follows the rule of not mentioning elements that are absent (e.g., it doesn't say \"no lens distortion\" or \"regular video speed\").\n*   **Coverage of Required Elements:** It covers **movement** and **focus** well but fails to explicitly include **camera angle** and **camera height**, which are required points in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that is more complete according to the instructions, while still aiming for conciseness:\n\n**\"Shot from a low angle, the camera slowly and smoothly tilts up to reveal the 'Flo's V8 Cafe' neon sign. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire sign sharp throughout the movement.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Adds Camera Angle:** Explicitly states it's a **\"low angle.\"**\n*   **Adds Movement Speed:** Includes the word **\"slowly\"** to better describe the pace of the tilt.\n*   **Maintains Strengths:** It remains accurate, relatively concise, and correctly identifies the tilt and deep focus.",
