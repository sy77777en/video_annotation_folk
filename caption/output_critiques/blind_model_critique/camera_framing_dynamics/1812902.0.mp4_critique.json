    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise at a slow speed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is good but could be improved by being more complete and concise.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **\"aerial-level camera at a high angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is positioned high in the air, looking down on the scene.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: **Correct.** The entire scene, from the treetops in the foreground to the road and car in the midground, is in sharp focus. The phrase \"with a large depth of field\" is slightly redundant as it means the same thing as \"deep focus,\" but it is not inaccurate.\n*   **\"camera smoothly arcs clockwise at a slow speed\"**: **Correct.** The camera performs a smooth, slow, clockwise rotational movement that follows the curve of the road.\n\n### Completeness:\n*   The caption is **incomplete** because it omits a key camera movement. While the camera is arcing, its primary purpose is to **track** the white car as it drives along the road. The arcing motion is a result of following the car around the bend. The instruction specifically asks to describe \"tracking (following a subject),\" which is a crucial element of this shot.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is mostly concise. However, phrases like \"looking down from above\" (which is implied by \"high angle\") and \"with a large depth of field\" (implied by \"deep focus\") could be removed for greater brevity.\n*   **Omission of Normals:** The caption correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none of these are present or altered, adhering perfectly to this part of the instruction.\n*   **Key Elements:** It successfully covers height, angle, focus, and some aspects of movement. However, by failing to mention the **tracking** movement, it misses a critical component of the camera's action and purpose.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is good because it accurately identifies the camera's height, angle, focus, and one of its movements. However, it is not great because it fails to mention the most important camera action: **tracking the car**. This omission makes the description of the camera's movement incomplete.\n\n**Improved Caption Example:**\n\n\"This aerial-level, high-angle shot uses deep focus. The camera smoothly tracks a car while arcing clockwise at a slow speed to follow the curve of the road.\"",
