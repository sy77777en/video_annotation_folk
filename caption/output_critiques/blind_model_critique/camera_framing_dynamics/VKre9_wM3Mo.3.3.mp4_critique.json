    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera showcases the toilet from a high angle, continuously trucking right while rolling counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good foundation, but it contains a contradiction and misses several key details that would be visually apparent. The phrase \"high, eye-level angle\" is confusing, as a high angle implies looking down from above, while an eye-level angle is typically parallel to the ground at a person's height. Based on the likely scenario of filming a toilet, the camera is probably at an adult's eye-level height but angled downward, making it a *high-angle shot*. The description of the movement could also be more specific; it's unclear if the truck and roll are slow and deliberate, creating a sense of unease, or fast and disorienting. Furthermore, as the camera trucks right, the toilet would move toward the left of the frame unless the camera is also panning to keep it centered, a detail that is omitted. The continuous roll creates a dynamic *Dutch angle*, a more precise term that could be used to describe the effect. The caption also fails to mention if the focus *tracks* the toilet to keep it sharp during the complex movement or if the focus plane is fixed. Finally, details like the video's playback speed (e.g., regular or slow-motion, which would significantly alter the mood) and the presence of any *barrel distortion* from a potentially wide lens used in a confined bathroom space are missing, leaving the description incomplete.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera captures a high-angle shot from an adult's eye-level height, angled downward to focus on a toilet in the midground with a shallow depth of field. As the camera trucks slowly to the right, creating a sense of unease, it rolls counterclockwise, introducing a dynamic Dutch angle. The toilet moves toward the left of the frame, suggesting the camera is not panning to keep it centered. The focus tracks the toilet to maintain sharpness during the movement. The video plays at regular speed, and there is noticeable barrel distortion from the wide lens used in the confined bathroom space.",
