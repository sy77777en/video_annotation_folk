    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n*   **\"From a ground-level, level angle...\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned very low to the floor and is aimed straight ahead, not tilted up or down.\n*   **\"...the camera smoothly moves to the left.\"**: This accurately describes the camera's movement. It is a steady, fluid motion from right to left (a trucking shot).\n*   **\"A shallow depth of field...\"**: This is correct. The background (wall, door) is noticeably blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"...keeps the focus on the boy and his toys in the midground.\"**: This is also correct. The boy and the toys he is actively playing with are sharp and in focus, while the foreground and background are soft. They are positioned in the midground of the frame.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption effectively includes all the necessary information as required by the instructions, while correctly omitting what isn't present:\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It covers height (`ground-level`), angle (`level angle`), movement (`moves to the left`), and focus (`shallow depth of field`, `focus on... the midground`).\n*   **Omissions**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no discernible lens distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus plane is static throughout the shot.\n*   **Movement Details**: It describes the movement's steadiness (`smoothly`) and direction (`to the left`), which is sufficient and clear.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and stylistic guidelines perfectly:\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: The caption is brief and easy to read, yet it packs all the critical technical details into two clear sentences.\n*   **Proper Terminology**: It uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions, such as `ground-level`, `level angle`, `shallow depth of field`, and `midground`.\n*   **Logical Structure**: The description flows logically, starting with the camera's static position, then describing its movement, and finally detailing the focus.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what the instructions asked for. It is a precise, professional, and well-structured description of the shot's technical and visual characteristics.",
