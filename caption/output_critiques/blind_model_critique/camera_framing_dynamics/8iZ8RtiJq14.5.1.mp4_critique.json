    "pre_caption": "From a bird's-eye view, the camera smoothly moves over a corkboard, shifting its focus from a sticker labeled \"BUTCHER\" to one reading \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND.\" As it moves, the camera rolls counterclockwise to adjust its orientation. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all the notes and the board's texture sharp. The camera's height is not discernible due to the lack of background information.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** This video lacks background information, making it difficult to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, in a bird’s-eye view looking down at a board with stickers, moves from one sticker to another while rolling counterclockwise to adjust its orientation.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption contains a significant contradiction regarding the camera's focus, stating both that the focus shifts and that the shot maintains a deep focus. Based on the video, the shot actually has a very shallow depth of field. It begins with the \"BUTCHER\" sticker in sharp focus in the foreground, while the rest of the corkboard, including the \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" sticker in the midground, is visibly blurred. The description of the movement as simply \"moves over\" is also too vague. The camera actually performs a slow, smooth truck to the right while simultaneously dollying in slightly. During this movement, it executes a clear rack focus, pulling sharpness from the first sticker to the second as it becomes the primary subject. Furthermore, the claim that the angle and height are \"unclear\" is inaccurate; the camera is positioned only a few inches above the board, creating a distinct high-angle shot, not a level one. The counterclockwise roll is a subtle corrective movement, reorienting the frame to keep the text of the \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" sticker perfectly horizontal as it comes into focus, which enhances the smooth narrative transition between the two subjects.",
