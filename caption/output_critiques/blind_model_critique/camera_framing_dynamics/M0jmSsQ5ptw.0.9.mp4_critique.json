    "pre_caption": "Shot from a level angle, this video features mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The unsteady camera moves downward, following an electric saw as it cuts through wooden planks. The motion's speed corresponds to the cutting action: slow while the saw is engaged with the wood and quick as it moves to the next plank.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves down, following an electric saw as it cuts through wooden planks. The motion corresponds to the cutting speed—slow while cutting and quick when moving to the next plank.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but contains a significant inaccuracy and could be more precise in its description of the camera's movement.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** The description of \"mild barrel distortion\" is accurate. The straight lines of the wooden planks appear to bow outwards slightly at the top and bottom edges of the frame, which is characteristic of this type of distortion.\n    *   **Focus:** The statement that the camera \"maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\" is correct. Both the saw in the foreground and the planks extending into the background are in clear focus.\n    *   **Steadiness & Movement Speed:** The description of the camera as \"unsteady\" is accurate, as there is noticeable handheld shakiness. The analysis of the motion's variable speed—\"slow while the saw is engaged... and quick as it moves to the next plank\"—is excellent and precisely describes the camera's behavior.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The most significant error is stating the shot is from a \"level angle.\" The camera is clearly positioned above the action and pointing down, which makes it a **high angle** shot, not a level one. A level angle would be parallel to the ground.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** Describing the movement as only \"downward\" is incomplete. The camera is primarily moving **forward** (dollying) to follow the saw along the cut, while also moving slightly **downward** (pedestaling) as it gets closer to the end of the planks.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers lens distortion, focus, steadiness, and the purpose/speed of the movement.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed and Dutch angle, as they are standard/absent, following the instruction for conciseness.\n*   However, it lacks a complete description of the camera's movement (missing the forward dolly) and doesn't specify the camera height (e.g., starting at waist-level and moving lower).\n\n#### **Adherence to Instruction**\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the instruction to be \"concise yet informative.\"\n*   It correctly uses specific terminology like \"barrel distortion\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   It fails to accurately apply the term \"level angle\" as defined by the instructions.\n\n### **Improved Caption Example:**\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and provides a more complete description:\n\n\"Shot from a **high angle**, this video features mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The unsteady, handheld camera **moves forward and downward**, tracking an electric saw as it cuts through wooden planks. The camera's speed varies, moving slowly during the cut and then quickly to reposition for the next one.\"",
