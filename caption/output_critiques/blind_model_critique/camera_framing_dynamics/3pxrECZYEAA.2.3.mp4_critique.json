    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** It zooms out slightly at first while continuously moving from right to left to track a bird in flight from the side.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving leftward to track the subject from the side. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good starting point—it is accurate and concise. However, it is incomplete and fails to include several key details required by the comprehensive instructions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe information presented in the caption is entirely accurate.\n*   **\"smooth side-tracking shot\"**: Correct. The camera movement is exceptionally steady and moves parallel to the subject.\n*   **\"follows a bird in flight\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the action and subject.\n*   **\"moving from right to left\"**: Correct. This is the direction of the camera's and subject's movement.\n*   **\"slightly zooming out\"**: Correct. The field of view gradually widens, making the bird appear slightly smaller by the end of the clip.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThis is the main area where the caption falls short. It omits several important configuration details that are explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption does not mention that this is a **low-angle** shot taken from a **low-level** height, likely just above the water's surface. This perspective is crucial as it makes the bird appear majestic against the sky.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The video clearly features a **shallow depth of field**, where the bird (midground) is in sharp focus, but the distant shoreline (background) is beautifully blurred. The camera also employs **focus tracking** to keep the moving bird perfectly sharp throughout the shot.\n*   **Additional Movement Details:** While \"side-tracking\" is a good summary, a more detailed description would note that the movement is a combination of **trucking left** (the physical movement of the camera) and **panning left** (the rotational movement to keep the bird framed).\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to the instruction for conciseness by correctly omitting details like \"regular video speed\" and \"no lens distortion.\" However, in its pursuit of brevity, it sacrifices the required level of detail for other critical elements like angle, height, and focus. The instructions ask for a \"concise yet informative\" description, and the caption leans too far into \"concise\" at the expense of \"informative.\"\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that incorporates the missing details while remaining clear and reasonably concise, fully adhering to the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a smooth, low-angle side-tracking shot that follows a bird in flight from right to left. The camera, positioned at a low level over the water, maintains a shallow depth of field by keeping the bird in sharp focus while blurring the background. The shot combines a leftward truck and pan with a slight zoom out.\"**",
