    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at eye level, initially positioned at a high angle looking down. It then transitions to a level angle as the camera slightly moves backward. The camera smoothly pans 90 degrees to the left to face the road, tilts up to a level position, and moves forward. The focus remains deep with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements are sharp. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly moves backward, then pans 90 degrees to the left to face the road. It tilts up to a level position and moves forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of your caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good and captures many key aspects of the video. However, it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the sequence of movements and could be more precise with its terminology to better align with the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"camera at eye level\" is a correct assessment for a first-person shot.\n    *   **Initial Angle:** \"initially positioned at a high angle looking down\" is perfectly accurate.\n    *   **Pan:** \"smoothly pans 90 degrees to the left to face the road\" is a very precise and correct description of that movement.\n    *   **Focus:** \"focus remains deep with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements are sharp\" is an excellent and accurate description of the focus.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"movement is smooth with minimal shaking\" correctly describes the quality of the handheld motion.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **The sequence of movements is incorrect.** The caption states the camera \"...pans 90 degrees to the left... **then** tilts up to a level position.\" In the video, the **tilt up** to a level angle happens *before* the pan to the left. The camera is already looking forward at a level angle when the 90-degree pan begins. This is the most significant error.\n    *   The description \"transitions to a level angle as the camera slightly moves backward\" is slightly imprecise. The two actions—tilting up and moving backward—happen concurrently, but one doesn't cause the other. They are separate movements performed by the person holding the camera.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Included:** The caption successfully covers camera height, angle, specific movements (pan, forward motion), focus/depth of field, and steadiness.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Perspective:** The most crucial piece of missing context is that this is a **first-person perspective (POV)** shot. Mentioning this immediately explains *why* the camera moves in such a natural, human way (e.g., tilting up to look, turning the body to pan).\n    *   **Movement Terminology:** While \"moves backward\" and \"moves forward\" are understandable, the instructions encourage more specific terms. \"Moves backward\" is a **dolly out**, and \"moves forward\" is a **dolly in** or **tracking forward**. The initial upward rotation is a **tilt up**. Using this terminology would make the description more professional and aligned with the prompt.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   You correctly followed the instruction to be concise by omitting mentions of normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion or a Dutch angle.\n    *   You attempted to describe the movements in temporal order, which is a key part of the instructions.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary failure in adherence is the incorrect temporal ordering of the tilt and pan, which violates the instruction to \"describe them in temporal order.\"\n    *   The description could better embrace the specific movement vocabulary (dolly, tilt, track) provided in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Example Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracies and incorporates the missing details for a more complete and precise description:\n\n**This first-person perspective (POV) shot begins at eye-level with a high angle, looking down. The camera simultaneously tilts up to a level angle while dollying back slightly. It then smoothly pans 90 degrees left to face the road before tracking forward. The focus is deep throughout, keeping all elements sharp, and the movement is smooth with a natural, minimal sway.**",
