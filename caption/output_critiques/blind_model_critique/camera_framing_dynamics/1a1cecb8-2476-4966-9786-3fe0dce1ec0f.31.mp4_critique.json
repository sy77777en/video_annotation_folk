    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is at eye level with a level angle, incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera is extremely unsteady, shaking intensely throughout. It initially pans right to face the crosswalk, then moves forward to cross the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The extremely unsteady camera, shaking intensely throughout, initially pans right to face the crosswalk, then moves forward to cross the road.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, concise, and adheres well to the instructions by using the specified terminology to describe the video's key technical characteristics. It successfully identifies the most prominent features like the fisheye distortion, unsteady movement, and camera positioning. However, it could be slightly more complete in its description of the camera's complex movements.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every statement it makes:\n*   **\"noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward\"**: This is correct. The ultra-wide lens creates a prominent fisheye effect, which is clearly visible in the curvature of buildings and street lines.\n*   **\"camera is at eye level with a level angle\"**: This is an accurate assessment. The perspective matches that of a person walking and looking forward.\n*   **\"incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling\"**: This is an excellent and precise observation. The camera rolls from side to side as the person walks, causing the horizon to tilt continuously.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. Nearly everything, from the foreground to the distant background, remains in sharp focus, which is typical for this type of action camera lens.\n*   **\"extremely unsteady, shaking intensely throughout\"**: This accurately describes the lack of stabilization and the jarring, handheld nature of the shot.\n*   **\"initially pans right... then moves forward\"**: This correctly identifies the two main purposeful actions the camera operator takes.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but has one minor area for improvement.\n*   **What it covers well**: It successfully covers lens distortion, camera height, angle, Dutch angle, focus/depth of field, and steadiness. It also correctly omits details like video speed, as it is at a regular playback rate.\n*   **Area for Improvement**: The description of **camera movement** could be more comprehensive. While it correctly identifies the main pan and forward motion, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of the movement as suggested by the instructions (\"*If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely*\"). The camera is not just shaking; it is also performing constant, small, erratic **tilts** (up and down) and **pans** (left and right) as the person looks around while walking. The current caption simplifies this to just \"shaking.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates excellent adherence to the provided guidelines.\n*   **Conciseness**: It is concise and avoids mentioning attributes that are not present (e.g., time-lapse, rack focus, shot transitions), as instructed.\n*   **Terminology**: It correctly uses the specified vocabulary, such as \"fisheye distortion,\" \"level angle,\" \"Dutch angle,\" \"rolling,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"pans.\"\n*   **Structure**: It logically describes the static properties of the camera setup (lens, position, focus) before describing the dynamic movements, which makes it easy to understand.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback to make the description of movement more complete, while maintaining conciseness.\n\n**\"The video features noticeable fisheye distortion and uses deep focus. The camera is at eye-level with a level angle, but the shot is extremely unsteady, with constant shaking, erratic tilting, and rolling that creates a varying Dutch angle. The primary camera movement consists of an initial pan to the right to face the crosswalk, followed by a forward movement to cross the road.\"**\n\nThis revised version more accurately distinguishes between the general, chaotic unsteadiness (shaking, tilting, rolling) and the specific, purposeful movements (panning, moving forward), providing a more complete picture that fully aligns with the instructions.",
