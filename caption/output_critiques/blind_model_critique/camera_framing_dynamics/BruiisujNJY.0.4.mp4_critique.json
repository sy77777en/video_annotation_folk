    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The exact camera height cannot be determined without additional context. \n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward, panning left, and moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it captures some basic elements, it is incomplete and fails to adhere to several key requirements of the prompt.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Vague Terminology:** The caption uses general terms like \"moves forward\" and \"moves to the right.\" The instructions specifically ask for technical terms like **dollying** (moving forward/backward) and **trucking** (moving left/right). Using the correct terminology would make the description more precise and professional.\n*   **Redundancy:** The phrase \"...utilizes a deep focus, resulting in a large depth of field where most of the scene is in focus\" is redundant. \"Deep focus\" inherently means a large depth of field. A more concise caption would simply state that the shot uses **deep focus**.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key pieces of information required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Missing Camera Height:** The caption mentions a \"level angle\" but completely omits the **camera height** (e.g., eye-level, hip-level, ground-level). This is a distinct and mandatory element according to the instructions.\n*   **Missing Movement Speed:** The instructions ask for the **speed** of the camera movements (e.g., slow, moderate, fast). The caption describes the movements but gives no indication of how quickly they occur.\n*   **Missing Movement Purpose:** While not always obvious, the instructions ask for the purpose of the movement if discernible (e.g., \"to follow a character,\" \"to reveal a new part of the scene\"). The caption does not address this.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Partial Adherence:** The caption correctly identifies the camera's unsteadiness, angle, and focus type. It also correctly follows the instruction to omit details about regular video speed or the absence of lens distortion.\n*   **Failure to Adhere:** It fails to use the specific vocabulary for camera movements (panning, tilting, dollying, trucking, etc.) that the instructions explicitly list. It also fails to provide a complete description by omitting mandatory elements like camera height and movement speed.\n\n### Example of an Improved Caption\n\nTo illustrate the difference, here is a hypothetical caption that better follows the instructions, using the information from the original caption and filling in the missing details with plausible assumptions:\n\n> **\"From a slightly unsteady, eye-level position, the camera slowly dollies forward and pans left, then trucks right at a moderate speed. The shot maintains a deep focus with a level angle, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**\n\nThis revised version is better because it:\n1.  Specifies the **camera height** (\"eye-level\").\n2.  Uses the correct technical terms (**dollying**, **trucking**).\n3.  Describes the **speed** of the movements (\"slowly,\" \"moderate speed\").\n4.  Remains concise by avoiding redundant explanations.",
