    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and almost perfectly aligns with the instructions. It is accurate, concise, and uses the correct terminology to describe the video's technical aspects.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video.\n*   **\"From a fixed... position\"**: Correct. The camera's position does not change (no panning, tilting, dollying, etc.).\n*   **\"...slightly unsteady...\"**: Correct. There is a subtle, high-frequency vibration, indicating the camera is not on a perfectly stable tripod.\n*   **\"...ground-level position...\"**: Correct. The camera is placed very low, almost touching the ground.\n*   **\"...shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The foreground subject (golf ball) is in sharp focus, while the background (the rest of the green, the flag, and trees) is significantly blurred.\n*   **\"The focus is maintained on the foreground...\"**: Correct. The plane of focus is on the golf ball in the foreground and does not change throughout the shot.\n\n**2. Completeness: Very Good**\n\nThe caption is very thorough and covers nearly all the relevant points required by the instructions.\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It successfully describes the camera's position (\"fixed,\" \"ground-level\"), steadiness (\"slightly unsteady\"), and focus (\"shallow depth of field,\" \"focus on the foreground\").\n*   **Omissions (Following Instructions)**: It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none of these are present, adhering to the rule of conciseness.\n*   **Minor Omission**: The only minor detail not included is the **camera angle**. The camera is at a **level angle** (parallel to the ground). While \"ground-level\" describes the height, \"level angle\" describes the vertical orientation. However, this is a very minor point, and its omission does not detract from the overall quality of the caption.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well.\n*   **Conciseness**: The description is concise yet informative, packing all the key details into two clear sentences without unnecessary words.\n*   **Terminology**: It uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions (e.g., \"fixed,\" \"ground-level,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"foreground\").\n*   **Clarity**: The structure is logical, first establishing the camera's physical setup and then describing its optical properties (focus). The second sentence effectively elaborates on the meaning of \"shallow depth of field\" in the context of this specific video, which adds value.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, clear, and concise, successfully capturing the essential technical details of the shot. The only potential improvement would be to add \"level angle\" for absolute completeness, but as it stands, the caption is highly effective and well-written.",
