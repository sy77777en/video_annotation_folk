    "pre_caption": "From a high, aerial angle, the camera tracks the game's avatars, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp. It initially moves right and down, then holds steady as the characters engage a monster in combat. Following the fight, the camera makes a slight downward and leftward shift.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the avatars in the game from an aerial view, starting with a rightward and downward movement. It remains static as they fight with the monster, then slightly shifts downward and leftward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview, but it misses several key cinematic details that define the shot's character. While it correctly identifies the \"high, aerial angle,\" a more precise term would be a \"high-angle\" shot, as the camera isn't directly overhead but rather at a 45-degree angle, typical for an isometric RPG. The description of movement as \"right and down\" is vague; the camera actually performs a smooth, continuous diagonal dolly, moving forward-right while simultaneously craning down to follow the avatars into a valley. The caption's claim that the camera \"holds steady\" during combat is inaccurate; while the primary position is fixed, there is a noticeable, subtle screen shake effect synchronized with the monster's heavy attacks and a quick, punchy zoom-in when a critical hit is landed. Furthermore, the video utilizes a speed ramp: the final, killing blow is shown in dramatic slow-motion before the speed returns to normal. The \"deep focus\" is mostly correct, but it overlooks the shallow depth of field used to slightly blur the distant background scenery, which helps separate the playable area from the environment. Finally, the \"slight downward and leftward shift\" after the fight is more purposeful; it's a slow crane-down and pan-left that re-centers the avatars in the frame as they collect their loot, setting up their departure from the scene.",
