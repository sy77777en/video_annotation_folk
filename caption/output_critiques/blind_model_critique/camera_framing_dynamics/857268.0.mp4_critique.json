    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone steadily moves forward, tracking the couple from an aerial view, then slightly descends at the end.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from above and behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is accurate, concise, and captures the most important aspects of the video's cinematography.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption based on the instructions:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is **very good**. It successfully identifies the key camera and video configurations, describes the movement clearly, and adheres to the instruction for conciseness by omitting unnecessary information.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\nYour description is highly accurate.\n*   **Camera Position (Aerial-level, High Angle):** Correct. The camera is positioned high above the subjects, looking down.\n*   **Focus (Deep Focus, Large Depth of Field):** Correct. Everything from the couple in the midground to the distant waves and horizon is in sharp focus.\n*   **Camera Movement (Smoothly moves forward, tracking, descends):** Correct. The camera performs a smooth forward dolly/tracking shot, following the couple. The slight descent (a pedestal down or crane down motion) at the end is also accurately noted.\n*   **Steadiness (Very smooth with no shaking):** Correct. The shot is perfectly stabilized, characteristic of a high-quality drone or gimbal.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is appropriately complete and follows the instructions on what to include and omit.\n*   **Included:** You correctly covered the most relevant points: camera height, angle, focus, and the primary movements (tracking, descending).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so you correctly omitted any mention of it.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so you correctly omitted this.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so you correctly omitted this.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to describe a rack focus or focus tracking.\n\nThe only minor point of incompleteness is not using the most specific technical terms for movement (e.g., \"dolly forward\" or \"pedestal down\"), but \"moves forward\" and \"descends\" are perfectly clear and acceptable alternatives.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nYou followed the instructions very well.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured sentence that conveys all the necessary information without being wordy.\n*   **Clarity:** The description is easy to understand for anyone, even without a background in cinematography.\n*   **Redundancy:** The phrase \"The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking\" is slightly redundant since you already stated the drone \"smoothly moves forward.\" For maximum conciseness, this could be integrated or removed, but it serves to emphasize the stability of the shot.\n\n### Conclusion and Suggestion for Improvement\n\nThe caption is excellent and requires no significant changes. It fulfills all the requirements of the prompt.\n\nIf you wanted to make it even more technically precise and concise, you could combine the elements into a single, denser sentence.\n\n**Slightly More Technical Version (Alternative):**\n\"From an aerial-level high angle with deep focus, the camera smoothly dollies forward, tracking a couple on a beach before subtly pedestaling down at the end of the continuous, stable shot.\"\n\nHowever, your original caption is arguably better for a general audience because it uses more common language (\"moves forward,\" \"descends\") while remaining perfectly accurate. Your version is a great example of balancing technical detail with readability.",
