    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant error regarding the camera's movement and lacks the level of detail requested by the instructions. While it correctly identifies the camera's height, angle, and depth of field, its description of the movement is incorrect and incomplete.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"shaky\"**: This is accurate. The camera is handheld and exhibits a moderate, natural shake.\n    *   **\"hip-level shot\"**: This is a reasonable and accurate description of the camera's height relative to the ground.\n    *   **\"level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is not tilted up or down; it's aimed straight at the subject.\n    *   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The background is clearly blurred, isolating the subject.\n    *   **\"keeping the man in the midground in focus\"**: Correct. The man is the focal point and is positioned in the midground of the frame.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"moves slightly forward\"**: **This is the main error.** The camera is actually moving **backward** (a dolly out or tracking backward motion). It does this to maintain a consistent distance from the man, who is walking *forward* toward the camera.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is too concise and omits several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Movement Type and Purpose:** The caption fails to describe the *type* of movement (tracking) and its *purpose* (to follow the subject). The instruction asks for descriptions like \"tracking,\" \"dollying,\" \"panning,\" etc.\n*   **Movement Speed:** It doesn't mention that the camera's backward movement is at a slow, walking pace, synchronized with the subject.\n*   **Focus Dynamics:** The caption states the man is \"in focus,\" but it misses the more dynamic description of **focus tracking**. Since both the camera and subject are moving, the focus is actively being adjusted to keep the man sharp. This is a more precise and informative detail.\n*   **Steadiness Degree:** While \"shaky\" is correct, the instructions suggest specifying the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate). \"Moderate\" would be a more descriptive term here.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully adheres to the instruction to be concise and to omit unnecessary information (like video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, which are all standard/absent).\n*   However, in its attempt at conciseness, it sacrifices both accuracy (the direction of movement) and the specific descriptive terms (tracking, focus tracking) that the instructions explicitly requested. It fails to strike the right balance between being concise and being informative.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"This moderately shaky, hip-level shot tracks backward at a walking pace, maintaining a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field with focus tracking to keep the man in the midground sharp as he walks toward the camera.\"**",
