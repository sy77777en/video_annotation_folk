    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the midground using a shallow depth of field. It pans from left to right with minor, slightly unsteady movements.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **good** but not perfect. It is accurate and concise, but it omits a few key details required by the instructions.\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is highly accurate in all the aspects it describes:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"eye level with a level angle\" is a precise description of the camera's setup.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"focusing on the midground using a shallow depth of field\" correctly identifies that the subject is in focus while the background is blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** \"pans from left to right with minor, slightly unsteady movements\" perfectly captures the primary camera motion and its handheld, slightly wobbly quality.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Good\nThe caption covers the most prominent features but misses a couple of details requested in the instructions:\n*   **Missing - Purpose of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement (e.g., tracking). While the pan is clearly following the person, the caption doesn't explicitly state that its purpose is to **track the subject**.\n*   **Missing - Dynamic Focus:** The instructions ask to note dynamic focus changes like *focus tracking*. Since the camera follows a moving subject and keeps her in focus, it is performing **focus tracking**. The caption only describes the static state of the focus (shallow DoF) and not this dynamic aspect.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction: Very Good\nThe caption successfully follows the core principles of the instructions:\n*   **Conciseness:** It is brief and to the point.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** It correctly avoids mentioning the regular video speed, the absence of lens distortion, and the lack of a Dutch angle, as instructed.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms (pan, shallow depth of field, eye level).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it provides an accurate and easily understandable summary of the shot's key visual characteristics. However, to be considered a perfect caption according to the detailed instructions, it should have also included the purpose of the camera's movement and the use of focus tracking.\n\nAn improved version that incorporates the missing elements would be:\n\n**\"Positioned at eye-level with a level angle, the camera tracks the subject by panning left to right with slightly unsteady movements. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, with focus tracking keeping the subject sharp in the midground.\"**",
