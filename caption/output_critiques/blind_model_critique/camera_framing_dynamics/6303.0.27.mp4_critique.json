    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a perfect example of how to apply the given instructions to a video. It is accurate, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and adheres strictly to all the rules and guidelines provided.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of the camera being at **\"ground level with a level angle\"** is precise. The lens is very close to the court's surface and is pointed straight ahead, not tilted up or down.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption correctly identifies a **\"shallow depth of field\"** and accurately notes that the focus is on the **\"basketball in the midground.\"** The ball is sharp, while the background elements (the other court, the net) are visibly and intentionally blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The statement that the camera is **\"completely static, with no movement or shaking\"** is correct. The shot is fixed, stable, and does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is perfectly complete according to the instructions. It includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what is not relevant.\n\n*   **Included Elements:** It successfully covers all the observable and pertinent configurations: camera height, angle, focus, depth of field, and movement (or lack thereof).\n*   **Omitted Elements:** Crucially, it follows the instruction to be concise by not mentioning aspects that are standard or absent.\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful adherence to the specific rules and terminology outlined in the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and to the point, conveying all the required information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the exact terminology requested in the instructions, such as `ground level`, `level angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `midground`, and `static`.\n*   **Clarity:** The caption is not only technical but also clear. The phrase \"...keeping the basketball sharp while the background is blurred\" is a great example of explaining the effect of the shallow depth of field, making the description informative for any reader.\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the information, starting with the camera's position and then moving to focus and movement, creating a description that is easy to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is a model example of what was requested. It is accurate, concise, and demonstrates a complete understanding of the instructions. There are no corrections or improvements to be made.",
