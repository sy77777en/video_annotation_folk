    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a level angle, focusing on a server in a restaurant. It uses a shallow depth of field, concentrating on the server in the foreground. The camera smoothly follows the server from behind in a third-person over-the-hip POV as they deliver water to a table. The server becomes smaller in the frame as the camera moves forward, ending with a slight pan to the left when the water is placed on the table.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video captures a third-person over-the-hip POV in a restaurant, following a server delivering water to a table of guests. The camera moves forward, tail-tracking the server, and ends with a slight pan to the left as they place the water on the table.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but not excellent. It correctly identifies the general mood and action of the video but falls short of the technical precision and terminology required by the detailed instructions. It describes *what* is happening from a viewer's perspective rather than fully detailing the *camera's configuration and operation*.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback Breakdown\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies a shallow depth of field, the smooth following motion, the server as the subject, and the slight pan at the end.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracies:**\n    *   **\"eye level\"**: This is not quite accurate. The camera is positioned lower than the server's eye level, closer to their hip or waist. The caption's own phrase, **\"over-the-hip POV,\"** is a much more accurate description of the camera's height and position relative to the subject.\n    *   **\"focusing on the server in the foreground\"**: While the server starts in the foreground, they quickly move into the **midground**. The focus plane is more accurately described as the midground for the majority of the shot.\n    *   **\"The server becomes smaller in the frame as the camera moves forward\"**: This describes the *result* of the camera's movement, not the movement itself. The instruction asks to describe the camera's action (e.g., dollying, tracking). The camera is dollying forward, but the server is walking away at a slightly faster pace, which is why they appear to get smaller.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key details required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Camera Movements:** The caption uses general terms like \"follows\" and \"moves forward.\" It fails to use the specific technical terms requested:\n    *   **Tracking:** The camera is clearly **tracking** the server.\n    *   **Dolly:** The camera is moving forward through space, which is a **dolly forward**.\n*   **Missing Focus Dynamics:** The server remains in focus while their distance from the camera changes. This requires active focus adjustment. The caption should have mentioned **focus tracking**.\n*   **Missing Steadiness Description:** While it says \"smoothly,\" it could be more explicit by stating the movement is **steady** or **stabilized**, implying the use of a gimbal or similar equipment.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some instructions well but misses the most important ones.\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is reasonably concise.\n    *   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly avoids mentioning the absence of lens distortion, speed changes, or Dutch angles, as instructed.\n    *   **Temporal Order:** It describes the final pan after the initial following movement, which is the correct order.\n\n*   **Where it fails to adhere:**\n    *   **Lack of Technical Terminology:** The primary failure is the lack of specific terms like **dolly, tracking,** and **focus tracking**, which are explicitly requested in the instructions for describing camera movement and focus.\n    *   **Describing Effect vs. Cause:** By stating \"the server becomes smaller,\" it describes the visual effect on the subject rather than the camera's mechanical action, which is the core focus of the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised, Excellent Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n\"Shot from a **hip-level, level angle**, the video uses a **shallow depth of field** to isolate the server. The camera performs a **steady dolly forward**, **tracking** the server from behind as they walk toward a table. **Focus tracking** keeps the server sharp in the **midground** as the distance increases. The shot concludes with a slight **pan left** to keep the action centered as the water is served.\"",
