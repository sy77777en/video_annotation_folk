    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a low angle, creating an upward perspective. It features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground, while the camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the static, unsteady nature of the camera, it contains a significant contradiction and misses several opportunities for detail. The phrase \"shot at eye level with a low angle\" is confusing, as \"eye-level\" typically implies a level perspective, whereas a \"low angle\" requires the camera to be positioned low to the ground. Based on the upward perspective described, the camera height is more likely \"hip-level\" or even \"ground-level,\" not eye-level. The description of the camera as \"fixed but slightly unsteady\" could be more specific; for instance, it could describe the unsteadiness as a \"gentle, handheld sway\" or \"minor, high-frequency jitter.\" Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the subject in the midground, which would provide crucial context for the focusing choice—for example, \"focus is held on a child playing on the floor.\" If the child were moving, the caption should also specify whether the focus is tracking them or remains locked on a fixed point, causing the child to drift in and out of focus. Finally, if a wide-angle lens was used to capture the scene from up close (a common reason for a low-angle shot), the caption should note if any resulting barrel distortion is visible at the edges of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is shot from a low angle, likely at hip-level or ground-level, creating an upward perspective. It features a shallow depth of field, focusing on a child playing on the floor in the midground. The camera remains fixed with a gentle, handheld sway, adding a slight unsteadiness to the shot. The focus remains locked on the child, allowing them to drift in and out of focus as they move. A wide-angle lens may have been used, as there is visible barrel distortion at the edges of the frame.",
