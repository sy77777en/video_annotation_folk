    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption's quality based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains significant errors regarding camera height and steadiness. While it correctly identifies some key aspects like the angle and depth of field, the inaccuracies make it a poor description of the video.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Low angle, creating an upward perspective:** This is accurate. The camera is positioned low and tilted upward, making the subjects appear taller and more dominant.\n    *   **Shallow depth of field:** This is correct. The background (building, sky) is clearly out of focus, isolating the subjects.\n    *   **Focusing on the midground:** This is correct. The plane of sharp focus is on the pedestrians walking by.\n    *   **Camera remains fixed:** This is correct. The camera does not pan, tilt, or move its position.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"shot at eye level\"**: This is **highly inaccurate**. The camera is placed very low, near the pavement. This is a **ground-level** or **low-level** shot, not eye-level. The perspective is looking up at the subjects' feet and legs, which would be impossible from eye level.\n    *   **\"slightly unsteady\"**: This is **incorrect**. The camera is perfectly stable and static, with no discernible shake or wobble. It was likely mounted on a tripod or placed on a solid surface.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is appropriately concise and adheres to the instruction to omit standard features. It correctly leaves out:\n*   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it's correctly omitted.\n*   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this is correctly omitted.\n\nThe caption successfully focuses on the non-standard configurations (low angle, shallow DoF) as instructed.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by describing camera height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   However, it fails to use the correct terminology provided in the instructions for **camera height** (`ground-level` instead of the incorrect `eye-level`) and **steadiness** (it should have stated the camera is `steady` or `stable`, not `unsteady`).\n*   The description of the focus and angle is good and aligns with the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately describes the video according to the provided instructions:\n\n**The video is captured from a static, perfectly steady camera at ground-level, using a low angle. It maintains a shallow depth of field with the focus fixed on the pedestrians in the midground.**",
