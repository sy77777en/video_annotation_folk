    "pre_caption": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, looking down at a racing car. The camera employs a Dutch angle that varies due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone executes a complex maneuver, smoothly arcing clockwise around the car while rolling clockwise. Initially positioned behind the car, the drone moves to the front by the end, tracking the car from an aerial view with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone tracks the racing car with a complex maneuver, arcing clockwise around it while rolling clockwise. Initially behind the car, it moves to the front by the end.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a superb example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and concise, effectively capturing all the key technical aspects of the shot.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so good:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's events and camera configuration.\n\n*   **Camera Position:** `overhead-level camera at a high angle` is a perfect description. The camera is clearly above the car, looking down.\n*   **Dutch Angle & Roll:** The observation that it `employs a Dutch angle that varies due to rolling` is spot-on. The horizon is tilted, and this tilt changes as the camera rotates along its lens axis (a roll).\n*   **Focus:** `maintains deep focus with a large depth of field` is correct. The car and the immediate track are sharp, and while the distant background has some blur, the overall impression is one of clarity and a wide focal plane.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement is the strongest part.\n    *   `complex maneuver`: Accurately summarizes the combination of movements.\n    *   `smoothly arcing clockwise around the car`: Correctly identifies the circular path and its direction.\n    *   `while rolling clockwise`: Correctly identifies the simultaneous camera rotation and its direction.\n    *   `tracking the car`: Correctly identifies the primary purpose of the movement—to follow the subject.\n*   **Steadiness:** `minimal shaking` is an accurate assessment of the professional, stable drone footage.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant details requested by the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **Covered:**\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** `overhead-level`, `high angle`.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** Explicitly mentioned and described as `varies due to rolling`.\n    *   **Movements:** Thoroughly detailed with `arcing`, `rolling`, `tracking`, `speed (smoothly)`, and `complexity (complex maneuver)`. The purpose is also implied (`tracking the car`).\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus`, `large depth of field`.\n*   **Correctly Omitted (as per instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there was no need to mention transitions.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption packs a significant amount of technical information into just a few sentences without feeling cluttered or overly technical.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses the precise vocabulary requested, such as `arcing`, `rolling`, `Dutch angle`, and `depth of field`.\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the complex movement is broken down logically: it's a complex maneuver that consists of a clockwise arc, a clockwise roll, and tracking. Describing the start and end positions (`Initially positioned behind the car, the drone moves to the front`) adds excellent clarity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It demonstrates a complete understanding of the instructions and a keen eye for analyzing camera work. It is a model example of what was requested: a concise, accurate, and technically detailed description of the video and camera configuration. There are no corrections or improvements needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a high-angle, overhead-level camera capturing a racing car. The camera uses a Dutch angle that shifts due to rolling, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone performs a complex maneuver, smoothly arcing clockwise around the car while rolling in the same direction. Starting from behind the car, the drone advances to the front by the end, consistently tracking the car from an aerial perspective with minimal shaking.",
