    "pre_caption": "The video features a handheld camera at eye level, initially capturing a rainbow from a low angle and then shifting to a level angle.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera pans left to reveal the full extent of the rainbow, tilting up initially, then down to show it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and provides a high-quality description that aligns well with the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is accurate, concise, and effectively captures the key technical aspects of the video as required by the instructions. It successfully describes the camera's configuration and movement in a clear and informative way.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate.\n*   **Camera Type and Height:** \"handheld camera at eye level\" is a correct assessment based on the naturalistic shaking and the perspective.\n*   **Camera Angle:** \"initially capturing a rainbow from a low angle and then shifting to a level angle\" accurately describes the change in perspective as the camera follows the rainbow's arc from its peak down toward the horizon.\n*   **Camera Movement:** \"pans left to reveal the full extent of the rainbow, tilting up initially and then down\" is a precise description of the camera's motion and its purpose.\n*   **Steadiness:** \"slightly unsteady with some shaking\" is a perfect description of the handheld movement.\n*   **Focus:** \"maintains deep focus with a large depth of field\" is correct, as everything from the midground trees and building to the background rainbow and clouds is in sharp focus.\n\n**2. Completeness:** The caption is nearly complete, covering all the most prominent and required features.\n*   **What it covers well:** It correctly identifies and describes camera height, angle, movement (pan, tilt), steadiness, purpose, and focus (depth of field).\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption does not mention the **slight barrel distortion** from the lens, which is visible in the slight curvature of the vertical lines of the building on the right as the camera pans. While minor, mentioning it would make the description exhaustive. However, for the sake of conciseness, omitting such a subtle detail is an acceptable choice.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   **Conciseness:** It avoids unnecessary words and gets straight to the point, fulfilling the \"concise yet informative\" directive.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** As instructed, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is normal), **Dutch angle** (which is absent), and **shot transitions** (as it's a single shot).\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., `low angle`, `level angle`, `pans`, `tilting`, `deep focus`, `large depth of field`).\n*   **Movement Description:** It clearly describes the movement type, direction, and purpose in a logical sequence, just as the instructions requested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the technical requirements and provides a description that is both accurate and easy to understand. The only possible improvement would be to mention the very subtle lens distortion, but its omission does not significantly detract from the overall high quality of the caption.",
