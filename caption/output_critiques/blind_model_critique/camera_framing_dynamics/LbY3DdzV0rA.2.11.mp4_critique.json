    "pre_caption": "This is a time-lapse video of a canyon at sunset, captured from an aerial, level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire vast landscape sharp. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a slow and smooth pan from left to right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video showing time passing rapidly over a long period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core elements, it oversimplifies the shot's complexity and misses key cinematic details. The description of movement as a simple \"slow and smooth pan\" is insufficient; the camera actually performs a more complex, multi-axis movement, simultaneously dollying forward into the canyon and craning down slightly, which creates a far more immersive \"flying\" sensation than a simple pan would. Consequently, the \"aerial, level angle\" is also inaccurate, as the shot begins from a high angle looking down and transitions to a more level perspective. The caption also omits the subtle barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens, visible in the slight outward curve of the canyon walls at the frame's edges. Furthermore, stating only \"deep focus\" misses a potential narrative element; the shot could begin with a shallower depth of field, focusing on a foreground rock formation, before pulling focus to render the entire vast landscape sharp as the camera moves deeper into the scene. Finally, specifying that the time-lapse effect is most evident in the rapidly moving cloud formations and the dramatic sweep of shadows across the canyon floor would add valuable descriptive context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video captures the breathtaking transition of a canyon at sunset, showcasing a complex, multi-axis camera movement. The shot begins with a high angle looking down, gradually transitioning to a more level perspective, creating an immersive \"flying\" sensation. The camera simultaneously dollies forward into the canyon and cranes down slightly, enhancing the dynamic visual experience. A subtle barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens is visible in the slight outward curve of the canyon walls at the frame's edges. Initially, the focus is on a foreground rock formation with a shallower depth of field, before pulling focus to reveal the entire vast landscape in sharp detail as the camera moves deeper into the scene. The time-lapse effect is most evident in the rapidly moving cloud formations and the dramatic sweep of shadows across the canyon floor, adding a captivating narrative element to the visual journey.",
