    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down at a church building. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly performs a counterclockwise arc around the church, transitioning to a trucking motion to the right at the end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera does a counterclockwise arc around the church building and at the end of the video transitions to a trucking motion to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic aerial high-angle shot and the counterclockwise arc, it oversimplifies the camera's complex and dynamic movement. The initial motion is not just a simple arc but a spiral, as the camera simultaneously cranes upward and dollys out, creating a dramatic reveal of the church's scale against its surroundings. The description of the final movement as \"trucking to the right\" is incomplete; this move serves a clear compositional purpose by reframing the church to the left third of the screen to reveal a vast mountain range in the background that was previously off-screen. Furthermore, the caption misses the cinematic speed ramp used throughout the shot, where the camera's movement starts slow, accelerates through the arc, and then decelerates into the final trucking reveal. The transition between the arc and the truck is also more of a fluid, overlapping maneuver rather than two distinct, sequential motions, and while the focus is deep, it's worth noting it specifically keeps both the midground church and the distant background mountains perfectly sharp, which is key to the shot's majestic feel.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a dynamic aerial shot of a church building, beginning with a complex spiral motion where the camera cranes upward and dollies out, dramatically revealing the church's scale against its surroundings. This movement is enhanced by a cinematic speed ramp, starting slow, accelerating through the spiral, and decelerating into a fluid transition. The camera then seamlessly shifts into a trucking motion to the right, purposefully reframing the church to the left third of the screen to unveil a vast mountain range in the background. The deep focus maintains sharpness across both the midground church and the distant mountains, contributing to the shot's majestic feel.",
