    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down at a church building. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly performs a counterclockwise arc around the church, transitioning to a trucking motion to the right at the end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera does a counterclockwise arc around the church building and at the end of the video transitions to a trucking motion to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is highly accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why it is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of an \"aerial-level camera at a high angle\" is perfectly accurate. The shot is clearly from a drone, high above the ground, looking down at the subject.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption correctly identifies the \"deep focus with a large depth of field.\" The church, the surrounding trees, and the background elements are all in sharp focus throughout the shot.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The analysis of the movement is spot-on and nuanced.\n    *   It correctly identifies the primary motion as a \"counterclockwise arc around the church.\"\n    *   It accurately notes the complex nature of the shot by describing how it \"transition[s] to a trucking motion to the right at the end.\" This shows a keen eye for detail, as the circular path does indeed straighten out into a lateral movement.\n    *   The use of the word \"smoothly\" is also correct, as the drone movement is stable and fluid.\n\n### Completeness:\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects of the shot as required by the instructions: camera height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   Crucially, it follows the rule of omission for standard features. It does not mention video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles because the video is at regular speed, has no discernible distortion, and maintains a level horizon. This demonstrates a correct interpretation of the conciseness instruction.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a model of efficiency. In just three sentences, it provides a comprehensive technical summary of the shot without any filler.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It correctly uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions, such as \"aerial-level,\" \"high angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"arc,\" and \"trucking.\"\n*   **Description of Movement:** It follows the instructions for describing complex movements by breaking them down into their sequential parts (\"performs a counterclockwise arc... transitioning to a trucking motion\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is exemplary. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of both the video's technical characteristics and the specific requirements of the captioning instructions. It is precise, concise, and uses the correct terminology to create a professional and accurate description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases an aerial-level camera at a high angle, capturing a church building from above. It utilizes deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera executes a smooth counterclockwise arc around the church, seamlessly transitioning to a rightward trucking motion at the conclusion.",
