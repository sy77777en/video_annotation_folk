    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera initially remains static with noticeable shakiness, presumably from the giants shaking the ground, then tilts down as one of the giants kneels to the ground.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good starting point but is **partially inaccurate and largely incomplete**. While it correctly identifies the main camera movement (the tilt) and the shakiness, it mischaracterizes the camera as \"static\" and omits several key descriptive elements required by the instructions, such as angle, height, and focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The caption's primary error is stating, \"The video begins with a static camera.\" A static camera is completely motionless. This camera is **never static**; it exhibits a constant, low-frequency **shakiness** from the very beginning. While it doesn't change its position (dolly, truck, etc.), the constant shaking means it is not static.\n*   **Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the \"noticeable shakiness\" and provides a plausible narrative reason for it (\"likely due to the giants shaking the ground\"), which aligns with the instruction to describe the purpose of movement.\n*   **Accurate:** It correctly describes the primary motivated movement: \"the camera tilts downward to follow the movement\" of the kneeling giant.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (Adherence to Instructions)\n\nThe caption is missing several key components mandated by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle (Missing):** The shot is clearly filmed from a **low angle**, looking up at the giants to emphasize their scale and power. This is a critical piece of information that was omitted.\n*   **Camera Height (Missing):** The camera appears to be at a human **eye-level** or slightly lower, which contributes to the low-angle perspective.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field (Missing):** This is a significant omission. The video has a distinct **shallow depth of field**.\n    *   **Focus Plane:** The giants in the **midground** are in sharp focus.\n    *   **Depth:** The snowy ground in the immediate **foreground** and the mountains in the distant **background** are both soft and out of focus.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus remains fixed on the giants; there is no rack focus.\n*   **Movement Description (Incomplete):** While it mentions shakiness and tilting, it fails to describe the *steadiness* of the camera accurately by calling it \"static\" initially.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Concise Formatting\n\n*   The caption correctly omits details for unchanged attributes like **video speed** (regular), **lens distortion** (none), and **Dutch angle** (none), which follows the instruction to be concise.\n*   However, its attempt at conciseness led to the omission of required information (angle, height, focus).\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a low angle at eye-level, the video maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the two giants in the midground in sharp focus. The camera is unsteady, exhibiting a constant shakiness throughout the shot. As the giant on the right kneels, the camera tilts downward to follow its movement.\"**\n\n### Why the Improved Caption is Better:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** It correctly identifies the camera as \"unsteady\" and \"shaky\" from the start, avoiding the inaccurate term \"static.\"\n*   **Completeness:** It includes all the required visual information:\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"low angle\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"eye-level\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"shallow depth of field\" and \"midground in sharp focus\"\n    *   **Movement:** \"unsteady,\" \"constant shakiness,\" and \"tilts downward\"\n*   **Conciseness:** It integrates all these details into a fluid, informative description without being overly wordy.",
