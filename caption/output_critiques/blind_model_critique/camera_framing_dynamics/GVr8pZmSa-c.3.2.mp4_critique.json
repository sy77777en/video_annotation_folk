    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow focus with middle ground in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward while slightly panning to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect fit for the video and follows the instructions precisely.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why it is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery detail in the caption is a correct observation of the video:\n*   **\"The underwater camera...\"**: Correctly identifies the camera's environment/height.\n*   **\"...is at a level angle...\"**: Correct. The camera is pointed straight ahead, parallel to the seafloor.\n*   **\"...maintaining a shallow focus with the middle ground in focus.\"**: Perfectly accurate. The coral structures in the midground are sharp, while the foreground and distant background are softly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"It moves smoothly backward while slightly panning to the right.\"**: This is an exact description of the camera's motion. It performs a slow, steady dolly-out (moves backward) and a slight pan right simultaneously.\n\n### 2. Completeness & Conciseness\nThe caption masterfully balances detail with brevity, as requested by the instructions:\n*   **Covers Key Elements**: It successfully describes the camera's height, angle, focus, depth of field, and movement (type, steadiness, and direction).\n*   **Obeys Conciseness Rule**: It correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or **Dutch angle**. Since the video is at a normal speed, has no noticeable distortion, and the horizon is level, mentioning these would be redundant and violate the instruction to be concise.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines perfectly:\n*   It uses the specific terminology suggested, such as \"level angle,\" \"shallow focus,\" and \"panning.\"\n*   It describes the multiple camera movements (\"backward\" and \"panning\") and their relationship to each other (\"while\").\n*   It clearly defines the focus plane (\"middle ground\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent because it is accurate, concise, and demonstrates a complete understanding of the detailed instructions. It provides a technically precise and easily understandable description of the shot's configuration and cinematography.",
