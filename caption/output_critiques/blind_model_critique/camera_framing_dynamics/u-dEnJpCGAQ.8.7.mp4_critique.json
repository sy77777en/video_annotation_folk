    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the smooth, slow nature of the camera work, it lacks the specific terminology and detail required by the instructions. The description of the camera angle as \"level-angle\" is likely inaccurate; the camera appears to be positioned at a *low angle* and near *ground-level*, which serves to make the jaguar appear more powerful and majestic against the jungle floor. The phrase \"moves slowly with only minor, subtle motion\" is too vague. A more precise description would be that the camera is *tracking* the jaguar by *trucking smoothly to the right*, perfectly matching the animal's walking pace. The \"subtle motion\" is actually a slow *pan* to the right to keep the jaguar's head centered as it moves across the frame. Furthermore, the caption misses a crucial element: the video is presented in *slow-motion*, which enhances the dramatic effect of the jaguar's muscular movement. Finally, the description of the focus could be improved by specifying that the camera is performing *focus tracking* on the jaguar in the *midground*, rather than just keeping a static focus on the \"foreground,\" which is actually out of focus along with the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a low-angle shot from near ground-level, enhancing the jaguar's powerful and majestic presence against the jungle floor. The camera employs a shallow depth of field with focus tracking on the jaguar in the midground, while both the foreground and background remain out of focus. The camera smoothly trucks to the right, perfectly matching the jaguar's walking pace, with a slow pan to the right to keep the jaguar's head centered in the frame. The video is presented in slow-motion, amplifying the dramatic effect of the jaguar's muscular movement.",
