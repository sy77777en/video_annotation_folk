    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera inside the car moves slowly and randomly, creating a casual feel as it showcases the car's interior.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good start, but the caption can be significantly improved in terms of accuracy and completeness based on the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is partially accurate but lacks the specific detail and precise terminology required by the instructions, especially concerning camera movement. It correctly identifies the general feel and focus of the shot but mischaracterizes the movement and omits key details.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **\"slow, smooth\"**: The camera movement is indeed slow and very smooth, indicating it's on a stabilizer like a gimbal or a slider.\n    *   **\"showcases the car's interior\"**: This correctly identifies the purpose of the shot.\n    *   **\"begins at a low angle and transitions to a level angle\"**: This is an accurate description of the change in camera angle.\n    *   **\"A shallow depth of field keeps the midground elements... in focus\"**: This is a perfect description of the focus and depth of field.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"random movement\"**: This is the most significant inaccuracy. The camera's movement is not random; it is a deliberate, controlled, and complex motion with a clear trajectory. It moves up, right, and slightly forward in a single, fluid path. Describing it as \"random\" suggests an erratic or unpredictable path, which is not the case.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (Adherence to Instructions)\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits several key descriptors requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Specific Movement Types:** The instructions ask for specific movements like *trucking, pedestaling, panning, etc.* The caption fails to identify that the camera is simultaneously **trucking right** (moving sideways), **pedestaling up** (moving vertically), and **panning slightly right** (rotating horizontally). Using the general term \"movement\" is not sufficient.\n    *   **Camera Height:** While the angle is mentioned, the corresponding **camera height** is not. The shot begins around **hip-level** (relative to a seated person) and rises to **eye-level**.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The instruction asks to note the steadiness. While \"smooth\" implies it, explicitly stating the shot is **perfectly steady** or **stabilized** would be more complete.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot. While there are no transitions to describe, a more thorough caption could note this by describing it as a \"single, continuous shot.\"\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"In a single, continuous shot, the camera performs a slow and perfectly steady complex movement, simultaneously trucking right and pedestaling up while panning slightly to the right. The shot begins at a low angle from hip-level, gradually transitioning to a level angle at eye-level to reveal the car's interior. A consistent shallow depth of field keeps the midground—the center console and passenger seat—in sharp focus.\"**",
