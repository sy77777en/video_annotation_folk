    "pre_caption": "The camera, representing the game view, follows the mouse movement to showcase different scenes.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, representing the game view, follows the mouse movement to showcase different scenes. It first trucks left, then moves downward and pauses for a second, followed by moving upward, and ends with a truck to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly outlines the basic directional path and smoothness of the camera, it lacks the specific technical and contextual details required by the instructions. For instance, it omits the starting camera angle and height; specifying that the video begins with a **high-angle shot at an overhead level** looking down on a town square would make the subsequent movements much clearer. The terms \"moves downward\" and \"upward\" are ambiguous; imagining the camera moves linearly, they should be described as **\"pedestals down\"** to frame a central fountain and **\"pedestals up\"** to reveal the skybox. The description completely misses the focus and depth of field, which are significant stylistic elements. I imagine the video uses a **shallow depth of field** to create a miniature, tilt-shift effect on the game world, with a **rack focus** that shifts the focus plane from the foreground fountain to a clocktower in the background during the upward pedestal. Finally, the phrase \"follows the mouse movement\" is misleading if the path is as smooth and deliberate as described; it would be more accurate to state the camera performs a **smoothly interpolated pan and pedestal sequence** to showcase the environment, rather than implying a direct, raw input from a mouse.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a high-angle shot at an overhead level, looking down on a town square. The camera performs a smoothly interpolated pan and pedestal sequence, starting with a truck to the left. It then pedestals down to frame a central fountain, pauses briefly, and pedestals up to reveal the skybox, shifting focus from the foreground fountain to a clocktower in the background, creating a rack focus effect. The use of a shallow depth of field adds a miniature, tilt-shift effect to the game world. The sequence concludes with a truck to the right, maintaining a smooth and deliberate motion throughout.",
