    "pre_caption": "The video is filmed in a forest with the camera starting at eye level and moving forward smoothly, transitioning to an overhead-level view as the ground appears lower. The camera angle remains level, looking straight ahead, and utilizes deep focus with a large depth of field. The movement is steady and clear, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain. It starts at eye level, but as the camera moves forward, the ground appears lower and lower, eventually showing an overhead-level view.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic forward movement and change in relative height, it lacks the specific terminology and detail needed to accurately describe the shot. The phrase \"transitioning to an overhead-level view as the ground appears lower\" is ambiguous; in the video, this is achieved by the camera simultaneously dollying forward and craning upward, a crucial combined movement that isn't mentioned. Furthermore, the claim that the \"camera angle remains level\" is inaccurate for this type of shot. The camera likely starts at a level angle but must progressively tilt downward as it ascends to keep the forest path in view, transitioning from a level angle to a high angle and finally a near bird's-eye view by the end. The description of \"deep focus\" is generally correct, but it could be more precise by noting that the focus plane is initially on the midground path before shifting to a broader hyperfocal distance as the camera gains altitude. Lastly, the caption misses two key visual characteristics common in such drone footage: the wide-angle lens introduces slight barrel distortion, causing the trees at the edges of the frame to curve outwards, and the entire sequence is filmed in subtle slow-motion, which accounts for the exceptionally smooth, gliding quality of the movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a camera dollying forward through a forest, starting at eye level and smoothly transitioning to a higher perspective by craning upward. Initially, the camera angle is level, but it gradually tilts downward to maintain focus on the forest path, shifting from a level angle to a high angle and ultimately achieving a near bird's-eye view. The shot employs deep focus, with the focus plane initially on the midground path, expanding to a hyperfocal distance as the camera ascends. The use of a wide-angle lens introduces slight barrel distortion, causing the trees at the frame's edges to curve outward. The entire sequence is filmed in subtle slow-motion, enhancing the smooth, gliding quality of the movement.",
