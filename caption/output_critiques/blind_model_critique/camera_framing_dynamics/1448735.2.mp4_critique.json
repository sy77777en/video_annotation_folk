    "pre_caption": "The video is filmed in a forest with the camera starting at eye level and moving forward smoothly, transitioning to an overhead-level view as the ground appears lower.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain. It starts at eye level, but as the camera moves forward, the ground appears lower and lower, eventually showing an overhead-level view.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **mostly good** but contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the camera's view and could be more concise and technically precise. While it correctly identifies several key aspects like the movement, steadiness, and focus, its description of the camera's height and angle transition is misleading.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Location:** \"filmed in a forest\" - **Correct.**\n    *   **Starting Height:** \"camera starting at eye level\" - **Correct.** The perspective begins at a height typical of a person walking.\n    *   **Movement & Steadiness:** \"moving forward smoothly\" and \"movement is steady and clear, with no shaking\" - **Correct.** The camera performs a very smooth forward motion, likely on a gimbal or drone.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"The camera angle remains level, looking straight ahead\" - **Correct.** The camera maintains a horizontal orientation, parallel to the horizon line.\n    *   **Focus:** \"utilizes deep focus with a large depth of field\" - **Correct.** Everything from the nearest trees to the distant background is in sharp focus.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **View Transition:** \"transitioning to an overhead-level view as the ground appears lower\" - **This is the main error.**\n        *   An **overhead view** (or bird's-eye view) implies the camera is looking *straight down* at the subject.\n        *   In the video, the camera's **angle remains level** (as the caption correctly states elsewhere), looking forward. What changes is the camera's *height relative to the ground below it*. The camera moves along a path on a ridge or elevated ground, so while the camera itself doesn't move up, the ground drops away.\n        *   This creates a **high-angle perspective** on the valley/ground below, but it is not an \"overhead view.\" The caption contradicts itself by stating the angle remains level while also claiming it becomes an overhead view.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption covers most of the required elements but misses a few opportunities for more precise terminology.\n\n*   **Covered:** Camera height, angle, basic movement, steadiness, and focus are all addressed.\n*   **Partially Covered:**\n    *   **Movement Type:** \"Moving forward\" is correct but could be more specific. The technical term for moving the camera forward is a **dolly forward**.\n    *   **Movement Speed:** The caption implies a constant speed with \"smoothly,\" but doesn't explicitly state it (e.g., \"at a slow, constant speed\"). This is a minor omission.\n*   **Correctly Omitted (as per instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention is needed.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the spirit of the instructions but could be improved.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is reasonably concise but has some redundancy.\n    *   \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" - These two phrases mean the same thing. Using one is sufficient (e.g., \"utilizes deep focus\").\n    *   \"moving forward smoothly\" and \"The movement is steady and clear, with no shaking\" - This is also redundant. \"Moves forward smoothly\" or \"A steady forward dolly\" covers it all.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses some correct terms (\"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus\") but misuses \"overhead-level view.\"\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate, concise, and adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\n**\"The shot begins at eye-level with a level angle and dollies forward smoothly through a forest. The camera maintains its steady forward motion as the terrain drops away, creating an increasingly high vantage point over the ground below. The entire scene is kept in sharp, deep focus.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Accurate:** It correctly describes the camera's movement (\"dollies forward\") and the changing relationship to the ground (\"creating an increasingly high vantage point\") without incorrectly labeling it \"overhead.\"\n*   **Concise:** It removes redundant phrases. \"Dollies forward smoothly\" combines movement type, direction, and steadiness.\n*   **Technically Precise:** It uses the correct term \"dolly\" and accurately distinguishes between the camera's constant angle and its changing elevation relative to the landscape.",
