    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a worm's-eye view angle (looking directly up).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera looks up at the sky and a tree, rolling clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is **excellent** for this video. It is accurate, complete according to the most relevant features, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is perfectly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects:\n*   **\"worm's-eye view angle, looking directly up at the sky and a tree\"**: This is a precise description of the camera's angle and subject framing. The camera is positioned very low and aimed vertically upwards.\n*   **\"The camera rolls smoothly clockwise\"**: This correctly identifies the specific type of camera movement (a roll, or rotation around the lens's axis), its quality (smooth), and its direction (clockwise).\n*   **\"maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp\"**: This is an accurate assessment of the focus. Both the nearby tree branches and the distant sky are in sharp focus, which defines a deep focus/large depth of field.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what isn't needed, demonstrating a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\n*   **Included (Correctly):**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** `worm's-eye view`\n    *   **Movement:** `rolls smoothly clockwise` (covers type, steadiness, and direction)\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus with a large depth of field`\n\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly omitted for conciseness.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Camera Height:** The term \"worm's-eye view\" effectively implies a ground-level or very low height, making a separate mention redundant.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** While the rolling motion creates a constantly changing Dutch angle, describing the movement as a \"roll\" is more specific and informative, as instructed.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs all the key visual information into a single, easy-to-read sentence without any filler.\n*   **Use of Specific Terminology:** It correctly uses technical terms mentioned in the instructions, such as **\"rolls,\" \"deep focus,\"** and **\"depth of field.\"**\n*   **Focus on Key Features:** It prioritizes describing the most prominent characteristics of the shot—the unique angle, the disorienting roll, and the clear focus—which is the essence of a good technical description.\n*   **No Unnecessary Details:** It avoids mentioning standard features (like normal speed) or non-existent ones (like distortion), just as the instructions advised.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is technically precise, efficiently written, and focuses on what makes the shot visually distinct. It demonstrates a complete understanding of both the video content and the descriptive requirements.",
