    "pre_caption": "This video is shot from the unsteady, eye-level perspective of a player in a first-person shooter game. The camera swiftly pans and moves around a battlefield. After being shot, the player's view retreats behind a building for cover. The entire scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video shows a first-person shooting game where the player navigates a battlefield, swiftly panning and moving to stay alert for enemies. After being shot, the player retreats behind a building to take cover.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions effectively. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the rules of conciseness and detail.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so good:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **\"unsteady, eye-level perspective of a player in a first-person shooter game\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera height is at the character's eye-level, and the movement includes a subtle but constant shake or \"head-bob\" effect to simulate running, making it \"unsteady.\" Framing it as an \"FPS game\" immediately and correctly sets the context for the viewer.\n*   **\"The camera swiftly pans and moves around a battlefield\"**: This accurately describes the initial actions. The player's view rotates (pans) and moves forward through the environment, which is clearly a battlefield. The speed is correctly identified as \"swift.\"\n*   **\"After being shot, the player's view retreats behind a building for cover\"**: This correctly identifies the key narrative beat and the purpose of the camera's subsequent movement. The retreat is a direct reaction to taking damage.\n*   **\"The entire scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp\"**: This is a crucial and accurate observation. In most video games of this type, there is no realistic depth of field; the player's weapon in the foreground, the midground environment, and the distant background are all rendered in sharp focus. \"Deep focus\" is the correct technical term for this effect.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It perfectly describes the configuration as a \"first-person shooter\" perspective, which is a highly effective shorthand for a complex set of parameters (eye-level, level angle, player-controlled movement).\n*   **Camera Height & Angle**: \"Eye-level\" is explicitly stated. The implied \"level angle\" is covered by the overall description.\n*   **Movements**: It covers steadiness (\"unsteady\"), speed (\"swiftly\"), type (\"pans and moves\"), and purpose (\"for cover\"). It wisely avoids listing every micro-movement (e.g., \"dollies forward, then pans left, then tilts slightly\"), instead summarizing the complex action as instructed.\n*   **Focus**: It correctly identifies the \"deep focus\" and explains what that means (\"keeping all elements sharp\").\n*   **Omissions**: As per the instructions, the caption correctly omits any mention of video speed (it's regular), lens distortion (there is none), or Dutch angles (the horizon is stable).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: The caption is extremely efficient. In just four sentences, it conveys the viewpoint, setting, movement style, a key story beat, the purpose of the action, and the specific focus characteristics of the shot.\n*   **Summarizes Complex Movement**: Instead of a tedious play-by-play, it uses the phrase \"perspective of a player in a first-person shooter game\" to brilliantly summarize the erratic, multi-axial, and purpose-driven movement. This is exactly what the instructions called for when dealing with complex or random movement.\n*   **Clarity**: The language is clear, direct, and easy to understand for anyone, even if they are not familiar with cinematography terms, thanks to helpful explanations like \"keeping all elements sharp.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is outstanding. It demonstrates a complete understanding of both the video's technical and narrative aspects and the specific requirements of the detailed instructions.",
