    "pre_caption": "This is a static shot with a fixed camera that remains slightly unsteady throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. It is inaccurate and incomplete, failing to meet several key requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Accuracy: Poor\n\nThe caption contains a direct contradiction:\n*   **\"Static shot\" and \"fixed camera\"** imply there is absolutely no camera movement.\n*   **\"Remains slightly unsteady\"** describes a form of movement (shaking or wobbling).\n\nA shot cannot be both static and unsteady. The instruction asks for a precise description of movement and steadiness. A more accurate description would clarify that the camera's *position* is fixed (i.e., it is not panning, tilting, or dollying), but it is not perfectly stable.\n\n**Correction:** Instead of \"static,\" the caption should use a term like **\"stationary\"** or **\"fixed-position\"** and then describe the lack of stability separately. For example: \"This is a stationary shot from a slightly unsteady, handheld camera.\"\n\n### 2. Completeness: Poor\n\nThe caption is far too brief and omits several mandatory pieces of information requested in the instructions.\n\n**Missing Information:**\n*   **Camera Angle:** There is no mention of whether the shot is from a high angle, low angle, or level angle.\n*   **Camera Height:** The description does not specify if the camera is at eye-level, ground-level, overhead, etc.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** There is no information about the depth of field (e.g., shallow or deep) or which part of the frame is in focus (foreground, midground, background).\n\nThe instruction explicitly requires these elements to provide an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\" By omitting them, the caption fails to provide a comprehensive picture of the shot.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Poor\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the core goal of being both **concise and informative**. While it is concise, it sacrifices essential information.\n\n*   It correctly omits details about normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, which aligns with the conciseness rule.\n*   However, it completely fails on the \"informative\" aspect by leaving out the required details about angle, height, and focus.\n*   The inaccurate use of \"static\" shows a misunderstanding of the specific terminology requested for describing camera movement and steadiness.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption\n\nTo illustrate what a good caption would look like for the video described, let's assume the video was shot from a person's hip, looking straight ahead, with a blurry background.\n\n**A good caption would be:**\n\n\"This is a stationary, hip-level shot at a level angle. The camera remains slightly unsteady throughout. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the midground in focus while the background is blurred.\"\n\nThis revised caption is:\n*   **Accurate:** It correctly distinguishes between the camera's stationary position and its unsteadiness.\n*   **Complete:** It includes camera height (\"hip-level\"), angle (\"level angle\"), steadiness (\"slightly unsteady\"), and focus (\"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground in focus\").\n*   **Adherent:** It provides all the necessary information in a concise and clear manner, fully satisfying the instructions.",
