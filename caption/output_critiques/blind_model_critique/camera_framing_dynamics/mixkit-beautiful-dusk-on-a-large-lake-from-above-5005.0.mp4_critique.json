    "pre_caption": "This is a slow, smooth aerial shot where the camera pedestals and tilts upward. This movement transitions the view from a high angle of the water and islands to a more level angle, revealing the sun setting behind the distant mountains.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good overview, it lacks specificity and misses key details that would likely be present in such a video. The description of the camera movement as \"pedestals and tilts upward\" is technically plausible but feels disjointed; a more fluid and accurate term for a single, smooth, ascending arc would be \"craning up.\" I also imagine the camera is simultaneously dollying forward, gliding slowly over the water towards the mountains, a crucial movement that adds dynamism and depth but is omitted from the caption. Furthermore, the caption fails to specify the video's playback speed. Given the subject is a sunset, it is highly probable that this is a *time-lapse* to show the sun dipping below the horizon, a critical detail that is more significant than the \"slow\" camera movement. The description of \"deep focus\" is accurate, but it could be more nuanced; for example, the distant mountains might be slightly softened by atmospheric haze, a natural effect distinct from focus. Finally, as the sun is revealed, a prominent, warm *lens flare* likely washes across the screen, an important visual characteristic that is not mentioned.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a smooth, fluid aerial shot where the camera cranes up in a graceful arc while simultaneously dollying forward, gliding over the water towards the mountains. The view transitions from a high angle of the water and islands to a more level angle, revealing the sun setting behind the distant mountains. Captured in a time-lapse, the sun dips below the horizon, adding a dynamic and captivating element to the scene. The landscape is kept sharp with deep focus, though the distant mountains are slightly softened by atmospheric haze. As the sun is revealed, a prominent, warm lens flare washes across the screen, enhancing the visual experience.",
