    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is out of focus. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. It contains a major inaccuracy and omits key information required by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"From a slightly unsteady, fixed, eye-level perspective, the shot is out of focus with a shallow depth of field. The focus plane then changes through a rack focus.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: **Poor**\n\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:** The caption describes the camera as both **\"slightly unsteady\"** and **\"fixed\"**. These terms are contradictory. A \"fixed\" camera is static, typically on a tripod, and would not be unsteady. The camera in the video is clearly **handheld**, which is the cause of the slight unsteadiness. The word \"fixed\" is incorrect.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The phrase \"out of focus with a shallow depth of field\" is imprecise for the beginning of the shot. The shot begins **completely out of focus**, where no plane is sharp. A shallow depth of field implies that *something* is in focus while the rest is blurry. The shallow depth of field is only established *after* the rack focus is completed.\n*   **Accurate Points:** The terms \"slightly unsteady,\" \"eye-level,\" and \"rack focus\" are all correct descriptions of what occurs in the video.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: **Incomplete**\n\nThe caption fails to include several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** It omits the camera angle, which is a **level angle**.\n*   **Camera Movement:** While it notes the camera is \"unsteady,\" it doesn't specify the *type* of movement (handheld) and incorrectly labels it as \"fixed.\"\n*   **Focus Plane:** The instructions explicitly ask to \"state the focus plane at each stage.\" The caption correctly identifies the \"rack focus\" but fails to mention that the focus shifts **from out-of-focus to the background**. This is a critical piece of missing information.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: **Poor**\n\n*   The caption fails to follow the instruction to describe the focus plane before and after a change.\n*   It introduces a logical contradiction (\"unsteady\" and \"fixed\") that makes the description confusing, violating the goal of providing an \"informative description.\"\n*   While it is concise, its conciseness comes at the cost of accuracy and completeness, failing to meet the core requirements of the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n**\"From a slightly unsteady, handheld, eye-level, and level-angle perspective, the shot begins completely out of focus. A rack focus then shifts the focus plane to the background, creating a shallow depth of field where the foreground foliage remains blurred.\"**",
