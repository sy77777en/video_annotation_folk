    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a first-person perspective at hip level, looking almost straight down at the ground with an upside-down high angle. As the person stands and turns, the camera moves upward to eye level, rolling counterclockwise with noticeable shaking. The angle transitions to a bird's-eye view by the end. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field throughout, capturing the scene clearly despite the slight unsteadiness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with an upside-down high angle, looking down at the ground, suggesting a first-person, head-mounted perspective. By the end, the camera transitions to a bird's-eye view.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The first-person camera initially looks almost straight down at the ground. As the person stands up and turns around, the camera moves upward and rolls counterclockwise with noticeable shaking.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has some significant flaws in accuracy and clarity that prevent it from being excellent.\n\n### Evaluation Breakdown:\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption correctly identifies the **first-person perspective**, the change in **camera height** (hip to eye level), and the **focus** (deep focus with a large depth of field).\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Confusing Terminology:** The phrase **\"upside-down high angle\"** is the most significant error. This is not standard terminology and is confusing. A \"high angle\" looks down on a subject. \"Upside-down\" implies the image is inverted. A more accurate description for a camera at hip level looking at the ground would be a **\"steep high angle\"** or an **\"extreme downward tilt.\"**\n    *   **Contradictory Description:** The caption states there is **\"noticeable shaking\"** during the movement but then concludes the scene is captured clearly despite **\"slight unsteadiness.\"** These two descriptions contradict each other. The degree of shakiness should be described consistently.\n    *   **Questionable Angle Description:** The transition to a **\"bird's-eye view\"** is a very specific claim. A bird's-eye view is a shot taken from directly overhead (90-degree angle). While possible if the person is looking over a ledge, it's more likely an exaggeration. A **\"high angle\"** would be a more probable and safer description unless the camera is truly pointing straight down at the subject/scene below.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully covers most of the required elements:\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** Clearly described, including the transition.\n    *   **Movements:** It describes a pedestal-like movement (\"moves upward\"), a rotation (\"rolling counterclockwise\"), and the unsteadiness (\"shaking\").\n    *   **Focus:** The depth of field is clearly explained.\n    *   **Conciseness:** It correctly omits details about normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, as per the instructions.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The description of the \"turn\" is incomplete. A person turning their body would primarily cause a **pan** (horizontal rotation). The caption only mentions a **roll** (rotation around the lens axis). If both are happening, it should be stated, for example: \"As the person turns, the camera pans left while rolling counterclockwise.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:** The author clearly attempted to follow the instructions by using specific vocabulary like \"hip level,\" \"eye level,\" \"rolling,\" \"bird's-eye view,\" and \"deep focus.\" The structure, which describes the initial setup, the movement, and the final state, is logical and effective.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The primary failure in adherence is the use of inaccurate and non-standard terminology (\"upside-down high angle\"), which goes against the goal of providing an \"informative description.\" The internal contradiction regarding the level of shakiness also detracts from its quality.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt that demonstrates an understanding of the instructions. However, it is flawed by **inaccurate terminology, a logical contradiction, and potentially exaggerated descriptions.** To be considered a great caption, it would need to use standard, precise language and maintain internal consistency.\n\n**Improved Version (Hypothetical):**\n\n\"The video is shot from a first-person perspective, beginning at **hip level** with a **steep high angle** looking down at the ground. As the person stands, the camera **pedestals up to eye level** and **pans left**, combined with a **counterclockwise roll** and **moderate shaking**. The shot settles on a **high-angle view** of the scene. The camera maintains a **deep focus** throughout, keeping the entire environment sharp.\"",
