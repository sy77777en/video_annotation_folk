    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It is accurate, complete, and adheres well to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is entirely accurate.\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The shot is taken from a height that corresponds to a person's eye level, looking straight at the subject, making \"eye level\" and \"level angle\" correct.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The woman is in sharp focus while the background is clearly blurred, which correctly identifies a \"shallow depth of field\" with the \"focus on the woman in the midground.\"\n*   **Camera Movement:** The frame is perfectly still throughout the video, so describing the camera as \"completely static\" is accurate.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting irrelevant details.\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes camera height, angle, focus, depth of field, and movement (or lack thereof).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video plays at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this does not need to be mentioned.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible lens distortion (like fisheye or barrel distortion), so it is correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so there is no Dutch angle to report.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and style guidelines well.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and avoids unnecessary words. It conveys all the key information efficiently.\n*   **Informative:** It provides a clear and technical description of the shot's configuration as requested.\n*   **Clarity:** The language used is precise and easy to understand (e.g., \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground,\" \"static\").\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Improvement\nWhile the caption is excellent as is, it could be made slightly more concise by combining the two sentences into one, which is a common practice for this type of technical description.\n\n**Slightly More Concise Version:**\n\"A static, eye-level shot at a level angle focuses on the woman in the midground with a shallow depth of field.\"\n\nThis is a minor stylistic preference. The original caption's two-sentence structure is also perfectly clear and acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills all aspects of the detailed instructions. It is accurate, covers all relevant points, and is written in the required concise and informative style.",
