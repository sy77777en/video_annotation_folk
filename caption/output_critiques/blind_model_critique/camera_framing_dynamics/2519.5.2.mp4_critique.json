    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **\"low-angle shot\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned below the main subjects (the buildings) and is aimed upward, creating a sense of scale and emphasizing the height of the architecture.\n*   **\"deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field\"**: This is accurate. Both the buildings in the midground and the clouds in the background are in sharp focus, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady\"**: This is a perfect description. There is no intentional camera movement like panning, tilting, or dollying. However, the subtle, high-frequency jitter clearly indicates it is a handheld shot, making it \"unsteady.\"\n*   **\"with no intentional movement\"**: This correctly clarifies that the unsteadiness is not a deliberate camera technique but a natural consequence of how it was filmed.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption effectively includes all the relevant details while correctly omitting the non-applicable ones, as instructed.\n*   **Included**: It correctly identifies and describes the key characteristics of the shot: camera angle, focus/depth of field, and the nature of its movement (or lack thereof).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly)**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable barrel or fisheye distortion, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs all the necessary information into two clear and efficient sentences without any fluff.\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology**: It uses precise terms like \"low-angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"unsteady.\"\n*   **Describes Movement Accurately**: It perfectly captures the nuance of a shot that is static in its intent but not perfectly steady in its execution.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules**: It demonstrates a clear understanding of the instructions by not mentioning the default or absent characteristics (normal speed, no distortion, etc.), which contributes to its conciseness.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is a precise and professional description of the video's technical configuration.",
