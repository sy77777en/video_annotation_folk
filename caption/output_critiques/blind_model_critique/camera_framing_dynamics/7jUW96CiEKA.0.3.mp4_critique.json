    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because while the information it contains is accurate, it fails to describe the single most important and dynamic element of the video: the **time-lapse**. This is a critical omission that violates the core instruction to describe the video's configuration, especially when the speed is altered.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:** The descriptive elements present in the caption are all accurate.\n    *   **\"shot at eye level with a level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned at a standard height, looking straight ahead at the horizon.\n    *   **\"The camera is static\"**: This is correct. The frame does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom throughout the video.\n    *   **\"maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity across the entire scene\"**: This is also correct. The foreground, midground (opposite shore), and background (mountains and clouds) are all in sharp focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What it gets wrong:** The caption is critically incomplete.\n    *   **Missing Video Speed:** The most significant visual effect in the video is the rapid movement of the clouds, which is characteristic of a **time-lapse**. The caption completely omits this. The instruction explicitly states, \"If **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse*.\" This is the primary action in the scene, and failing to mention it means the caption does not adequately describe the video.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption **fails to adhere** to a key instruction.\n    *   It violates the rule to describe altered video speed. The instructions prioritize this by listing it first and providing specific examples (*time-lapse*, *slow-motion*, etc.).\n    *   While it correctly adheres to the instruction for conciseness by omitting mentions of \"no lens distortion\" or \"no Dutch angle,\" this does not make up for the failure to describe the time-lapse effect.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that accurately follows all the given instructions:\n\n**\"This is a time-lapse video of a landscape, captured from a static, eye-level camera with a level angle. The shot maintains a deep focus and a large depth of field, ensuring the entire scene, from the reflective water in the foreground to the distant mountains and rapidly moving clouds, remains perfectly sharp.\"**",
