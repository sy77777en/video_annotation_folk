    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the illuminated avatar in a dark environment, initially moving back slightly before trucking right alongside it.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is very good and does a great job of adhering to the detailed instructions. Here is a breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **\"From a high, overhead angle...\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned high above the subject, looking down.\n*   **\"...the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**: This is correct. Both the character (midground) and the details of the ground are in sharp focus throughout.\n*   **\"The camera movement is very smooth...\"**: This is accurate. The movement is perfectly steady, with no shaking or wobbling, suggesting a digital camera or a professional rig.\n*   **\"...as it tracks a small, illuminated figure in a yellow coat.\"**: This correctly identifies the subject and the purpose of the camera movement (tracking).\n*   **\"It initially moves back slightly before trucking right...\"**: This is a precise and accurate description of the camera's path. It correctly identifies the initial backward movement and the subsequent lateral \"trucking\" motion.\n\n**Completeness: Very Good**\nThe caption is comprehensive and covers most of the key elements requested in the instructions.\n*   **Included:** It successfully covers camera angle/height, focus/depth of field, and a detailed breakdown of camera movement (steadiness, type, direction, and purpose).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none of these are present or altered from the norm.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The instructions provide specific terminology for a direct top-down view: **bird’s eye angle**. While \"high, overhead angle\" is accurate, \"bird's eye\" is the more precise term for this specific shot. Similarly, the instructions specify **overhead-level** for height, which could have been used for added precision.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into just three sentences without being overly verbose.\n*   **Technical Terminology:** It correctly uses technical terms like **\"deep focus,\" \"tracks,\"** and **\"trucking,\"** as encouraged by the instructions.\n*   **Structure:** It logically describes the static setup (angle, focus) before detailing the dynamic movement, which is a clear and effective way to structure the information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, mostly complete, and follows the instructions closely. Its only minor shortcoming is not using the most specific terminology (\"bird's eye angle\") offered in the instructions.\n\n### Example of a Perfect Caption (incorporating the minor feedback):\n\nFor a perfect score, the caption could be slightly refined to use the most precise terms from the instructions:\n\n\"From a **bird's eye angle** at an **overhead-level**, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera movement is very smooth as it **tracks** a small, illuminated figure in a yellow coat. It initially **dollies back** slightly before **trucking right** to follow the character's movement through the dark environment.\"\n\n*(Note: \"Moves back\" is perfectly acceptable, but \"dollies back\" is the more formal term for moving the entire camera apparatus backward.)*",
