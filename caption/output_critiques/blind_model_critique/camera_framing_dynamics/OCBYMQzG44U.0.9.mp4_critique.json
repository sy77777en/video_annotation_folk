    "pre_caption": "The video is captured above water at a low angle, looking up at a large, glossy mask sculpture. There is mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera uses deep focus, keeping both the mask and the background elements sharp. The camera moves smoothly backward, steadily revealing more of the mask and its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery technical detail mentioned in the caption is a correct observation of the video:\n*   **\"above water at a low angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned close to a reflective surface (implying water) and is clearly aimed upward at the sculpture, creating a low-angle shot that emphasizes the subject's size.\n*   **\"mild barrel distortion\"**: This is a subtle but correct observation. The vertical lines of the building in the background curve slightly outward near the edges of the frame, which is characteristic of barrel distortion.\n*   **\"deep focus\"**: This is accurate. Both the sculpture in the foreground and the trees and building in the background are sharp and clear, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"moves smoothly backward\"**: This correctly identifies the camera's movement (a dolly out), its quality (smooth and steady), and its purpose (to reveal the full sculpture and its environment).\n\n### 2. Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information as requested by the instructions, while correctly omitting what is not present or normal.\n*   **Configuration Description**: The caption provides a concise yet comprehensive summary of the camera's setup and execution.\n*   **Camera Height and Angle**: It correctly identifies the height as \"above water\" and the angle as \"low angle.\"\n*   **Lens Distortion**: It correctly identifies and describes the \"mild barrel distortion.\"\n*   **Focus**: It accurately describes the \"deep focus\" and explains its effect.\n*   **Movement**: It details the camera's movement type (\"backward\"), steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"steadily\"), and purpose (\"revealing more of the mask and its surroundings\").\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption follows the rule of not mentioning aspects that are standard or absent. It correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is normal), **Dutch angle** (which is not present), and **focus changes** (as the focus is static).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It demonstrates a keen eye for technical detail and the ability to communicate those details clearly and concisely.",
