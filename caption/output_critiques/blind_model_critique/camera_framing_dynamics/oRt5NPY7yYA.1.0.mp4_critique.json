    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera at a bird's-eye view, looking directly down at a convoy of vehicles on a road. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene. It moves smoothly upward and to the left, tracking the convoy as it progresses. As the camera moves, the vehicles become smaller in the frame, indicating a change in perspective while maintaining a steady and smooth motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up and moving left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** but could be improved. It successfully identifies and describes the most critical aspects of the video's configuration as required by the instructions (height, angle, focus, and movement). However, it suffers from some minor redundancy and could be more concise and technically precise.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy:\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is highly accurate in its descriptions.\n    *   `aerial-level camera at a bird's-eye view`: Correctly identifies both the height and the direct downward angle.\n    *   `deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene`: Accurately describes the depth of field and explains its effect.\n    *   `tracking the convoy`: Correctly identifies the purpose of the camera movement.\n    *   `vehicles become smaller in the frame`: This is an excellent observation that correctly implies the camera is moving physically away from the subject (craning/pedestaling up) rather than zooming out.\n\n#### Completeness:\n*   **Very Good:** The caption covers most of the required elements.\n    *   **Covered:** Camera Height, Camera Angle, Focus/Depth of Field, Movement Type (tracking), Movement Steadiness (smooth, steady), and Movement Purpose.\n    *   **Correctly Omitted:** Video Speed, Lens Distortion, and Dutch Angle are not mentioned, which correctly implies they are standard/not present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n    *   **Minor Omission:** The specific types of translational movement are described directionally (\"upward and to the left\") but not with technical terms like **craning/pedestaling** and **trucking**. While the description is clear, using the technical terms would be more precise. The speed of the movement is also not explicitly stated (e.g., slow, moderate).\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Good:** The caption follows the structure and intent of the instructions well.\n    *   It provides a concise description of the camera's configuration.\n    *   It correctly identifies and explains key terms like `deep focus` and `bird's-eye view`.\n    *   It describes the movement's qualities (`smoothly`, `steady`).\n    *   **Area for Improvement:** The final sentence contains redundancy. The phrase \"indicating a change in perspective\" is an interpretation rather than a direct description of movement, and \"maintaining a steady and smooth motion\" repeats information from the previous sentence.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nTo make the caption excellent, it could be revised to be more concise and technically precise, eliminating the redundant phrases.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> The video features an aerial-level camera at a bird's-eye view, looking directly down at a convoy of vehicles on a road. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene. It moves smoothly upward and to the left, tracking the convoy as it progresses. As the camera moves, the vehicles become smaller in the frame, indicating a change in perspective while maintaining a steady and smooth motion.\n\n**Improved Version:**\n> From an aerial-level, bird's-eye perspective, the camera tracks a convoy of vehicles with deep focus. The camera performs a smooth, steady movement, **craning upward and trucking to the left**, causing the convoy to shrink in the frame as it moves away.\n\nThis revised version is better because:\n1.  **It's more concise:** It combines the initial setup into a single, flowing sentence.\n2.  **It's more precise:** It uses the technical terms **\"craning\"** (vertical arcing/moving up) and **\"trucking\"** (moving left/right) to describe the movement.\n3.  **It removes redundancy:** It avoids repeating that the motion is \"steady and smooth.\"\n4.  **It's more direct:** It clearly states the camera's movement causes the vehicles to shrink, removing the interpretive phrase \"indicating a change in perspective.\"",
