    "pre_caption": "This video is shot from a level angle with a deep focus, keeping the foreground trees and the background house and mountains sharp. The camera performs a very smooth upward movement, rising from behind the trees to reveal a large, unusual house built on a cliff. The shot then becomes static, holding on the view of the house.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves upward for most of the video, rising out of the trees to reveal a house. Toward the end, the motion stops, leaving the camera perfectly still.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good, but it could be improved by being more specific and using the precise terminology requested in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption provides a clear and plausible description of a video shot. It accurately identifies several key technical elements:\n*   **Camera Angle:** Correctly identifies a \"level angle.\"\n*   **Focus:** Correctly identifies \"deep focus\" and specifies which planes (foreground and background) are sharp.\n*   **Movement:** Accurately describes the movement's direction (\"upward\"), quality (\"very smooth\"), and purpose (\"to reveal a large, unusual house\").\n*   **Shot Composition:** Correctly notes the sequence of events: a movement followed by a static hold.\n\nThe description is logical and paints a coherent picture of the camera work.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses a few key details that are explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Focus:** Provides a thorough description of the deep focus and what is in focus.\n*   **Movement Purpose:** Clearly states the movement's purpose is to reveal the house.\n*   **Movement Sequence:** Describes the transition from movement to a static shot.\n\n**What could be added for better completeness:**\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption doesn't specify the starting height (e.g., *eye-level, ground-level*). It only describes the vertical motion.\n*   **Movement Terminology:** \"Upward movement\" is a general term. The instructions encourage using more precise terms like **pedestaling** (moving vertically up) or **craning** (moving up in an arc).\n*   **Movement Speed:** The speed of the movement is not mentioned (e.g., *slow, moderate, fast*). While \"smooth\" implies a controlled speed, specifying it would be more informative.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to some instructions well but falls short on others.\n\n**Strengths in Adherence:**\n*   **Conciseness:** It successfully follows the instruction to be concise by omitting unnecessary information (regular video speed, no lens distortion, no Dutch angle).\n*   **Core Elements:** It covers the most critical aspects: angle, focus, and movement.\n*   **Movement Purpose:** It includes the purpose of the camera movement, which is a key part of the instructions.\n\n**Areas for Improvement in Adherence:**\n*   **Use of Specific Terminology:** The instructions provide a glossary of specific camera movements (*pedestaling, craning, tilting,* etc.). The caption uses the general phrase \"upward movement\" instead of a more technical and precise term like **pedestaling up**.\n*   **Inclusion of All Required Descriptors:** The instructions ask for a description of camera height and movement speed, both of which are missing from the caption.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that more fully adheres to the instructions, incorporating the missing details:\n\n**\"Shot from a level angle starting at eye-level, this video maintains a deep focus, keeping the foreground trees and background mountains sharp. The camera slowly and smoothly pedestals upward to reveal a large, unusual house on a cliff, then becomes static to hold on the final composition.\"**\n\nThis revised version is better because it:\n1.  Specifies the starting **camera height** (*eye-level*).\n2.  Uses the more precise term **pedestals upward** for the movement.\n3.  Includes the **speed** of the movement (*slowly*).",
