    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from a first-person shooter (FPS) perspective. The camera starts at an overhead, high-angle position, looking down on the scene. It then moves downward, gradually tilting up until it reaches an eye-level, level-angle view. After landing, it moves forward slightly. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and it maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an overhead level (around second floor height) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents an FPS game view, intermittently moving downward from a high-angle perspective at first. As it nears the ground, it gradually tilts up, reaching a level view upon arrival. It then slightly moves forward to match the player's pace.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the general trajectory of the camera, it could be significantly more precise and evocative by incorporating more technical terminology and descriptive detail. The description of the initial movement as \"moves downward, gradually tilting up\" is vague; a more accurate description would be a rapid `pedestal down` from an `aerial-level`, `bird's-eye view`, which simultaneously `tilts up` to transition into a `level-angle` perspective. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the speed of these movements, such as the high-velocity descent followed by a slower, deliberate `dolly forward` at a walking pace. The \"slight unsteadiness\" could be more specific by distinguishing between the violent, jarring shake upon impact and the subsequent rhythmic, subtle bobbing characteristic of a first-person walking animation. Furthermore, the caption omits potential visual artifacts common in this genre, such as the slight `barrel distortion` at the edges of the frame from a wide field-of-view lens, or a potential `speed ramp` effect where the action briefly enters `slow-motion` for dramatic emphasis as the character lands before resuming normal speed. Finally, stating the camera starts at an \"overhead, high-angle\" could be refined to the more specific `aerial-level` height and initial `bird's-eye` angle, which better captures the feeling of dropping into a map from a great height.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a first-person shooter (FPS) perspective, starting from an aerial-level, bird's-eye view. The camera executes a rapid pedestal down, simultaneously tilting up to transition into a level-angle perspective. This high-velocity descent is followed by a slower, deliberate dolly forward at a walking pace. Upon landing, the camera experiences a violent, jarring shake, then settles into a rhythmic, subtle bobbing typical of a first-person walking animation. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, and there is a slight barrel distortion at the edges of the frame due to the wide field-of-view lens. Additionally, a speed ramp effect briefly introduces slow-motion for dramatic emphasis as the character lands before resuming normal speed.",
