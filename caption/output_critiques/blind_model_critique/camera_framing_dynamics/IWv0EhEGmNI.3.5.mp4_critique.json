    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from a first-person shooter (FPS) perspective. The camera starts at an overhead, high-angle position, looking down on the scene. It then moves downward, gradually tilting up until it reaches an eye-level, level-angle view. After landing, it moves forward slightly. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and it maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an overhead level (around second floor height) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents an FPS game view, intermittently moving downward from a high-angle perspective at first. As it nears the ground, it gradually tilts up, reaching a level view upon arrival. It then slightly moves forward to match the player's pace.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is very good, but it can be improved by incorporating more of the specific terminology from the instructions and adding a few missing details.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Judgment:** The caption is **good**. It accurately captures the main actions and visual properties of the video in a clear and concise manner. However, it misses some of the finer details and uses general terms where the instructions provide more specific technical ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy:\n*   **\"first-person shooter (FPS) perspective\"**: **Accurate.** This correctly identifies the style of the shot.\n*   **\"starts at an overhead, high-angle position\"**: **Mostly Accurate.** \"High-angle\" is correct. \"Overhead\" is understandable, but the instructions provide the more precise term **\"aerial-level\"** for this extreme height.\n*   **\"moves downward, gradually tilting up until it reaches an eye-level, level-angle view\"**: **Accurate.** This correctly describes the primary vertical movement and the change in camera rotation and final position.\n*   **\"After landing, it moves forward slightly\"**: **Accurate.**\n*   **\"slightly unsteady with some shaking\"**: **Accurate.** The camera simulates head movement and is not perfectly stable.\n*   **\"maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: **Perfectly Accurate.** All elements from the foreground (hands, parachute) to the background (buildings, landscape) are in sharp focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness:\n*   **Video Speed, Lens Distortion, Dutch Angle**: The caption correctly omits these as they are not present, following the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle**: Well-covered. The transition from aerial/high to eye-level/level is noted.\n*   **Movements**: This is the main area for improvement.\n    *   It correctly identifies the downward, forward, and tilting movements.\n    *   **Missing Detail:** It fails to mention the slight **panning** (horizontal rotation) that occurs as the player looks around during the descent and after landing.\n    *   **Lacks Specificity:** It uses general terms like \"moves downward\" and \"moves forward\" instead of the more technical terms **\"pedestaling down\"** and **\"dollying forward\"** provided in the instructions.\n*   **Focus**: This is covered completely and accurately.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption is commendably concise.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: The caption adheres partially. While it uses terms like \"high-angle,\" \"eye-level,\" and \"deep focus,\" it misses the opportunity to use more specific movement terms like **pedestaling, dollying, and panning**, which were explicitly listed in the instructions.\n*   **Structure**: The chronological description of events is clear and follows the instructions well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong B+. It successfully describes the video for a general audience. To be an A+ caption that fully meets the detailed requirements of the instructions, it needs to incorporate the specific technical vocabulary for camera movements and mention the subtle panning.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely follows the instructions:\n\n> From a first-person perspective, the shot begins at an **aerial-level** with a **high angle**. The camera **pedestals rapidly downward** while simultaneously **tilting up** to a **level angle**, transitioning to an **eye-level** view upon landing. During the descent and after landing, the camera also **pans slightly** left and right. The entire shot is characterized by a slight, continuous shake and maintains a **deep focus**, keeping all elements from foreground to background sharp.",
