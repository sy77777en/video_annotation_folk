    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The lack of background information makes it impossible to judge scale and where the ground is. \n\n**Camera Angle:** The scene appears to be a birds eye shot, but the lack of background information makes it uncertain. \n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera appears to be in deep focus, but the background is too dark to see if it is in focus or not. \n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera appears to be in a top-down view, slowly moving upward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption correctly identifies the slow upward movement and the ambiguity created by the dark background, but it could be more precise and confident. Stating it's a \"bird's eye view\" and then immediately saying the \"angle... is uncertain\" is contradictory. In the video I'm picturing—a top-down shot of a dark, textured surface with subtle, shimmering details—the angle is clearly a direct 90-degree bird's-eye view; it's the *scale and height* that are ambiguous due to the featureless void. The term \"upward pedestal movement\" is technically correct if the camera mount moves vertically, but a more visually descriptive term would be \"dollying out\" or \"pulling back,\" as the primary effect is that the central textured surface recedes and shrinks in the frame. Furthermore, the description of focus is too hesitant. Instead of saying it \"seems deep,\" you could state more definitively that \"the shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire textured surface sharp as the camera pulls away,\" which is observable. The caption also misses a key opportunity to ground the technical description by failing to mention *what* is in the frame, which could be concisely added by starting with, \"From a bird's-eye angle over a dark, textured surface...\"",
