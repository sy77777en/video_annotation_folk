    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera pans from left to right with slight unsteadiness, exhibiting some shaking.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of the relevant details, and adheres almost perfectly to the instructions, including the crucial rule of conciseness by omitting unnecessary information.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: **Excellent**\n\nEvery statement in the caption is a correct and precise description of the video's technical attributes.\n\n*   **\"mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The vertical lines of the buildings and poles clearly show a slight outward curve, which is characteristic of mild barrel distortion. The explanation of the effect is also a great addition.\n*   **\"camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle\"**: This is correct. The perspective matches that of a person standing and looking straight ahead. The horizon is not tilted, confirming the level angle.\n*   **\"employs deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: This is accurate. Objects in the foreground (road), midground (cars), and background (buildings) are all in sharp focus.\n*   **\"camera pans from left to right with slight unsteadiness, exhibiting some shaking\"**: This correctly identifies the primary camera movement (a pan right) and its quality (the slight jitter of a handheld shot).\n\n#### 2. Completeness: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes lens distortion, camera height, camera angle, focus/depth of field, and camera movement (type, direction, and steadiness).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** There is no tilted horizon, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there was no need to describe transitions.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions' nuances.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and to the point. It avoids jargon where possible or explains it (as with barrel distortion).\n*   **Informative Description:** It provides a clear picture of the shot's technical setup. The description of the movement is particularly good, capturing both the intentional pan and the unintentional unsteadiness.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms as specified in the instructions (barrel distortion, eye level, level angle, deep focus, pan).\n\n### Suggestion for Minor Improvement\n\nWhile the caption is already excellent, one could make it even more concise by combining the description of the camera's unsteadiness.\n\n*   **Original:** \"...with slight unsteadiness, exhibiting some shaking.\"\n*   **Slightly More Concise Version:** \"...pans unsteadily from left to right.\" or \"...pans from left to right with slight shaking.\"\n\nThis is a very minor point, and the original phrasing is perfectly clear and acceptable. The redundancy can even be seen as emphatic, which is not necessarily a negative.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and well-written, effectively communicating the camera and video configuration without any unnecessary fluff.",
