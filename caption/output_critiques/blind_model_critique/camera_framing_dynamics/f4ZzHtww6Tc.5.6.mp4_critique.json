    "pre_caption": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera is positioned at ground level with a level angle, utilizing a deep focus that keeps a large depth of field sharp. The camera moves forward at a slight angle, tracking the skateboarder from a rear-side perspective, causing the skateboarder to appear larger in the frame over time. Around the middle of the video, the camera pans slightly to the left as the skateboarder moves slightly left, positioning himself more directly in front of the camera. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward at a slight angle, tracking the skateboarder from a rear-side perspective. Around the middle of the video, it pans slightly to the left as the skateboarder moves slightly left, positioning himself in front of the camera.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking. Please generate only one paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the fisheye distortion, ground-level position, and general tracking motion, it could be more precise and evocative. The term \"level angle\" might be inaccurate; given the ground-level height, it's more likely a slight *low angle* looking up at the skateboarder, which serves to make them appear more prominent and heroic. The description of \"deep focus\" is a good start, but it overlooks the significant motion blur that would likely be visible on the ground rushing past in the foreground and on static background elements, creating a dynamic contrast with the relatively sharp subject. The movement description, \"moves forward at a slight angle,\" could be more concisely termed a \"dolly track from a rear-quarter perspective.\" Instead of just noting the skater \"appears larger,\" the caption could specify that the camera is actively \"closing the distance\" or \"dollying in\" on the subject. Furthermore, the \"pan to the left\" is likely not a distinct action but rather a minor course correction within the continuous tracking shot to maintain framing, and describing it as such would be more accurate. Finally, the caption misses key potential details: it could specify the nature of the unsteadiness (e.g., \"high-frequency vibrations from the rough pavement\") and, more importantly, it fails to mention a crucial (imagined) stylistic choice, such as a brief segment of *slow-motion* as the skateboarder executes a trick, which dramatically shifts the video's pacing and focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases noticeable fisheye distortion, with the camera positioned at ground level, capturing the skateboarder from a slight low angle that enhances their prominence and heroic stature. Utilizing deep focus, the video contrasts the sharpness of the skateboarder with motion blur on the rushing ground and static background elements. The camera executes a dolly track from a rear-quarter perspective, closing the distance on the skateboarder. As the skateboarder shifts slightly left, the camera makes a minor course correction to maintain framing. The movement is characterized by high-frequency vibrations from the rough pavement, adding to the dynamic feel. A brief slow-motion segment highlights a trick, dramatically shifting the video's pacing and focus.",
