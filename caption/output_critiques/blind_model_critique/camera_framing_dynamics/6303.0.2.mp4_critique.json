    "pre_caption": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down from above, with a fixed Dutch angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera remains completely static throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but has significant flaws in **accuracy** and **conciseness**. While it correctly identifies several key technical aspects, it contains a major contradiction and includes redundant phrasing that violates the instruction to be concise.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption's primary weakness is its internal contradiction.\n\n*   **Contradiction:** The caption states the camera is at **\"eye level\"** and uses a **\"high angle.\"** These two descriptions are almost always mutually exclusive.\n    *   **Eye-level** means the camera is placed at the height of a subject's eyes (typically 5-6 feet off the ground), creating a neutral perspective.\n    *   **High angle** means the camera is positioned *above* the subject's eye line and tilted downward, which tends to make the subject seem smaller or less powerful.\n    *   A camera at eye-level height cannot simultaneously have a high angle unless the subject is on the floor. In that specific case, a more precise description would be needed (e.g., \"From an eye-level height, the camera tilts down in a high angle to view the subject on the ground\"). As written, the caption is confusing and likely inaccurate.\n\n*   **Redundancy:** The caption includes phrases that are redundant, which can be considered a form of inaccuracy by being imprecise.\n    *   \"...high angle, **looking down from above**...\" — The phrase \"looking down from above\" is the definition of a high angle, making it unnecessary.\n    *   \"...deep focus **with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp**.\" — \"Deep focus\" inherently means a large depth of field where all elements are sharp. The extra description is redundant.\n    *   \"...mild barrel distortion, **causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward**.\" — While this explanation is helpful for a general audience, it's not strictly necessary under the \"concise\" instruction, as \"barrel distortion\" is the technical term.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete according to the instructions, assuming certain conditions about the video.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly omits any mention of video speed. According to the instructions, this implies the video plays at a normal, regular speed. This is a good application of the rules.\n*   **Elements Covered:** It successfully covers:\n    *   Lens Distortion (barrel distortion)\n    *   Camera Angle (high angle)\n    *   Camera Height (eye level - though contradictory)\n    *   Dutch Angle (fixed)\n    *   Focus (deep focus)\n    *   Movement (static)\n\nThe caption covers all the necessary positive attributes (distortion, Dutch angle) and correctly omits the negative ones (normal speed).\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some instructions well but fails on the core principle of being **concise**.\n\n*   **Conciseness (Failed):** As noted in the accuracy section, the caption is not concise. The redundant phrases (\"looking down from above,\" \"with a large depth of field,\" etc.) add unnecessary length. The goal is a dense, technical description, not an explanatory one.\n*   **Static Shot (Followed):** The instruction states, \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static.\" The caption does this perfectly with \"The camera remains completely static throughout the video.\"\n*   **Clarity (Failed):** The contradiction between \"eye level\" and \"high angle\" makes the description unclear and difficult to visualize.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion and Improved Caption\n\nThe caption is **not good** because its central contradiction makes it inaccurate and confusing. It also fails the conciseness test by including redundant explanatory text.\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that corrects the errors and adheres strictly to the instructions. This version assumes the \"high angle\" was the intended description, as it's a more distinct stylistic choice than \"eye level.\"\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n\n> A static, high-angle shot with a fixed Dutch angle and mild barrel distortion. The camera maintains deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
