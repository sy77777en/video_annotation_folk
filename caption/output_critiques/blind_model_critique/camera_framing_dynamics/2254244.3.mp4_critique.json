    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera that starts at a level angle and transitions to a high angle, looking down. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, mounted on a drone, moves smoothly forward, tilts down, and pans left midway to adjust its orientation, capturing a city scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone showcases a city scene, continuously moving forward and tilting down, while gradually panning left midway to adjust its orientation.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is factually correct in every aspect of its description:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** It correctly identifies the camera as being at an **aerial-level**. The description of the angle transition from a **level angle** (looking forward) to a **high angle** (looking down) is precise.\n*   **Focus:** The statement that it maintains **deep focus** with a **large depth of field** is accurate. All elements, from the buildings in the midground to those in the distant background, remain sharp and clear throughout the shot.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is spot-on. The camera does move **smoothly forward**, **tilts down**, and performs a slight **pan to the left** midway through the shot. The inference that it's \"mounted on a drone\" is a logical and correct explanation for the smooth, high-altitude movement.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not needed:\n*   **Covered Elements:** It successfully describes the camera's **height**, **angle**, **focus/depth of field**, and the complex **movements** (translation, rotation, and steadiness).\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this is correctly not mentioned.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is stable and not tilted, so this is correctly left out.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and content guidelines exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into two clear and easy-to-read sentences.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested, such as \"aerial-level,\" \"level angle,\" \"high angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"tilts down,\" and \"pans left.\"\n*   **Movement Description:** It accurately describes the compound camera movement, noting the smoothness, direction (forward), and rotational changes (tilt and pan) in a logical sequence. It also correctly identifies the purpose of the pan (\"to adjust its orientation\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is technically precise, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and concise in its delivery.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a drone-mounted camera that begins at an aerial level with a level angle, transitioning smoothly to a high angle looking down. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing a clear city scene. The camera moves forward, tilts down, and pans left midway to adjust its orientation, all in a single, continuous shot.",
