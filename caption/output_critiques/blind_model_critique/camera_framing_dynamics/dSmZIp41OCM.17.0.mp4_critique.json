    "pre_caption": "From a high, overhead angle, the camera smoothly tracks a cartoon character walking through a yard.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the character from an high angle aerial view, moving backward throughout the video, with a brief leftward movement midway.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good overview, it could be more precise and detailed. The term \"high, overhead angle\" is somewhat ambiguous; specifying it as a \"high angle shot from approximately ten feet\" would be clearer, distinguishing it from a direct \"bird's-eye view.\" The description of movement as \"backward\" and \"leftward\" could be refined using more technical terms like \"dollying backward\" and \"trucking left.\" For instance, the camera might be dollying out to maintain a medium shot as the character walks towards the viewer, while the truck left is a corrective move to keep them centered as they navigate around a flowerbed. The caption also misses a subtle vertical movement; perhaps the camera cranes down slightly as it pulls back, creating a more dynamic reveal of the yard. Furthermore, describing the scene as being in \"deep focus\" might be misleading for a cartoon. Since animations often lack a physical camera's depth of field, it would be more accurate to state that \"the entire scene is rendered with a uniform focus, keeping all elements sharp,\" which better reflects the artificial nature of the visuals. Finally, the caption omits any mention of potential lens characteristics, such as a slight barrel distortion that could be used to give the cartoon world a more playful, rounded aesthetic.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera captures a cartoon character walking through a yard from a high angle shot approximately ten feet above, distinguishing it from a direct bird's-eye view. The camera dollies out to maintain a medium shot as the character approaches the viewer, with a truck left to keep them centered while navigating around a flowerbed. A subtle crane down occurs as the camera pulls back, dynamically revealing more of the yard. The entire scene is rendered with a uniform focus, ensuring all elements remain sharp, reflecting the artificial nature of the animation. Additionally, a slight barrel distortion adds a playful, rounded aesthetic to the cartoon world.",
