    "pre_caption": "The video is a stop-motion animation featuring a claymation scene. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, focusing on a girl in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. Initially, the camera smoothly zooms in on the girl, then remains static for the duration. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video where objects are moved frame by frame to create motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a scene in a claymation, briefly zooming in to focus on the girl initially, then remaining static until the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a high-quality and accurate description that perfectly follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a **\"stop-motion animation\"** and specifies the medium as **\"claymation,\"** both of which are accurate.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It correctly states the camera is at **\"eye level\"** (relative to the subject) with a **\"level angle.\"**\n*   **Focus:** The description of **\"focusing on a girl in the foreground with a shallow depth of field\"** is precise. The subject is sharp while the background is clearly blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The caption accurately describes the movement in chronological order: an initial **\"smoothly zooms in\"** followed by the camera becoming **\"static for the duration.\"**\n*   **Steadiness:** The observation that the movement is **\"very smooth, with no shaking\"** is correct. The camera is perfectly stable, as is typical for stop-motion setups.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe caption is comprehensive without being verbose. It covers all the relevant points from the instructions that are present in the video:\n\n*   **Video Speed:** Covered (`stop-motion`).\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** Covered (`level angle`, `eye level`).\n*   **Movements:** Covered (`zooms in`, `static`, `smooth`, `no shaking`).\n*   **Focus:** Covered (`shallow depth of field`, `focusing on... foreground`).\n\nCrucially, it correctly omits details that are not present, as per the instructions. There is no mention of lens distortion, Dutch angles, or shot transitions because there are none, which demonstrates a good understanding of the \"conciseness\" rule.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and to the point, using just two sentences to convey all the necessary information.\n*   **Informative Description:** It provides a full picture of the technical setup, allowing a reader to visualize the shot without seeing the video.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specific terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"stop-motion,\" \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"zooms in,\" and \"static.\"\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description is structured logically, starting with the static elements of the setup (position, focus) and then describing the camera's movement over time.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an exemplary response to the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and concise, using the correct terminology to describe the video's technical aspects perfectly. There are no necessary improvements.",
