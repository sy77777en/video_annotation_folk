    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** The video is shot at eye level with a low angle, looking up from below. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it contains significant inaccuracies regarding camera height and focus, which are fundamental aspects of the shot's composition.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy: Poor**\n\n*   **\"shot at eye level\"**: **Incorrect.** The camera is positioned significantly lower than the subject's eyes, likely around his hip or waist. This is a **hip-level** or **low-level** shot, not an eye-level one.\n*   **\"with a low angle, looking up from below\"**: **Correct.** The camera is indeed angled upwards toward the subject.\n*   **\"It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp\"**: **Incorrect.** This is a major error. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**. The subject in the midground is in focus, but the background (cabinets, wall, items on the counter) is distinctly blurry. Deep focus would render both the subject and the background sharp.\n*   **\"The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\"**: **Correct.** This accurately describes the camera's state. It is a static shot, but the minor jitter indicates it was likely handheld by an operator trying to remain still.\n\n**2. Completeness: Fair**\n\n*   The caption correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none of these are present, adhering to the conciseness instruction.\n*   It successfully covers the required categories of camera height, angle, focus, and movement. However, the information provided for two of these categories is wrong.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction: Poor**\n\n*   While the caption attempts to use the specified terminology (e.g., \"eye level,\" \"low angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"depth of field\"), its failure to apply them correctly means it does not provide an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n*   The primary goal of the instruction is to create an accurate description, and this caption fails in that regard by misrepresenting key visual characteristics of the video.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a more accurate caption that follows your instructions:\n\n\"Shot from a **hip-level** height at a **low angle**, this video uses a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the subject in the midground sharp while blurring the background. The camera is **static** but has a slight, continuous unsteadiness.\"",
