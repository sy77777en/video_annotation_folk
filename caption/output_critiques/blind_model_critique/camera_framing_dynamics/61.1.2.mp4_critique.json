    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to apply the provided instructions. It is accurate, concise, and complete, correctly identifying all the key visual characteristics of the shot while adhering to the rule of omitting unnecessary information.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy:\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail.\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle...\"**: **Correct.** The camera is not looking up or down at the subject (level angle) and is positioned at the height of his head (eye level).\n*   **\"...focusing on the man in the midground.\"**: **Correct.** The man is the plane of focus, and he is positioned in the middle ground of the frame, not immediately in front of the lens or far in the background.\n*   **\"It employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the man sharp while blurring the background.\"**: **Correct.** The subject is in sharp focus, while the background elements (pillars, other people) are distinctly out of focus, which is the definition of a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\"**: **Correct.** This is a nuanced and precise description. The camera's position is static (fixed), but there is a minor, persistent wobble characteristic of a handheld shot. The caption correctly identifies this as unsteadiness rather than a deliberate camera movement like a pan or tilt.\n\n#### 2. Completeness:\nThe caption is perfectly complete according to the instructions, including the instructions on what to omit.\n\n*   **Included Elements:** It successfully covers all the relevant aspects present in the video: camera height, camera angle, focus plane, depth of field, and camera steadiness/movement.\n*   **Omitted Elements:** Crucially, it follows the rule: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"*\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable barrel or fisheye distortion, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The frame is horizontally level, so this was correctly omitted.\n\nBy leaving out these \"normal\" attributes, the caption remains concise and focuses only on the defining characteristics of the shot.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful adherence to all provided guidelines.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs all the necessary information into two clear, well-structured sentences.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It correctly uses the specified terminology, such as `eye level`, `level angle`, `midground`, and `shallow depth of field`.\n*   **Describing Movement:** It perfectly follows the instruction to describe steadiness, correctly identifying the shot as fundamentally static (\"fixed\") while also noting the \"slightly unsteady\" quality.\n*   **Describing Focus:** It clearly defines both the depth of field (`shallow`) and the focus plane (`midground`), as requested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an ideal response to the prompt. It is technically precise, easy to read, and demonstrates a complete understanding of the instructions, including the more subtle rules about conciseness and omission. There are no improvements to suggest.",
