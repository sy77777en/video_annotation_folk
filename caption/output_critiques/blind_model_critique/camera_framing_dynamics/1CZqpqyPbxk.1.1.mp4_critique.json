    "pre_caption": "The video is at regular speed with no lens distortion. The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking. The camera height, angle, and focus are not significant enough to mention.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. It is inaccurate, incomplete, and fails to adhere to the core requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption is correct that the video is at regular speed, has no lens distortion, and the camera is static.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The final sentence, \"The camera height, angle, and focus are not significant enough to mention,\" is factually incorrect. These are all clearly discernible and significant cinematographic choices in the video that define how the scene is presented.\n    *   **Focus:** The video clearly exhibits a **deep depth of field**, where both the midground (couch, table) and the background (view outside the window) are in sharp focus. This is a significant and deliberate choice.\n    *   **Angle & Height:** The camera is positioned at a **level angle** and what appears to be **eye-level** or chest-level. These are standard but defining characteristics of the shot's perspective.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is highly incomplete because it omits several key details that are both present in the video and explicitly requested by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Camera Angle:** It fails to mention the **level angle**.\n*   **Missing Camera Height:** It fails to describe the **eye-level** height.\n*   **Missing Focus Details:** This is the most significant omission. The caption should have described the **deep depth of field** and specified that the **focus plane is on the midground**, keeping most of the scene sharp.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to follow the instructions in several ways:\n\n*   **Violation of Conciseness:** The instruction states, \"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion... there is no need to mention these.\" The caption explicitly mentions these unnecessary details, making it less concise.\n*   **Failure to Describe Key Elements:** The instruction requires a description of camera angle, height, and focus. The caption dismisses these as \"not significant,\" directly contradicting the prompt's requirement to provide an informative description of these very elements. The goal is to describe what is there, not to make a subjective judgment on its significance.\n*   **Incorrect Phrasing for Static Shot:** The instruction suggests, \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static.\" The caption is slightly wordy (\"completely static, with no movement or shaking\").\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a good caption that accurately follows all the given instructions for this video:\n\n**\"The static shot is filmed from a level, eye-level angle. It uses a deep depth of field, keeping both the midground living room and the background outside the window in sharp focus.\"**",
