    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, moving forward smoothly through a forest. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead, and then transitions to a high angle, looking down from above. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the forest scenery clearly. The movement is steady, with the camera tilting down as it progresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at ground level. As it moves forward, the ground appears lower, showing an eye-level view even though the camera hasn’t risen.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and tilting down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the steady forward movement, downward tilt, and deep focus, it contains several confusing and imprecise descriptions. The statement that the camera begins at \"ground level\" while also \"moving forward and tilting down\" is contradictory; it's more likely the camera starts at a *low height* just above the ground. The description of the angle change is particularly muddled. Stating that the camera \"transitions to a high angle\" but creates an \"illusion of an eye-level view\" is confusing. In the video, the camera likely maintains a relatively consistent altitude while the ground slopes away steeply, causing the camera's perspective *relative to the ground* to shift from a level angle to a high angle. The \"illusion\" part is subjective and inaccurate; it is simply a high-angle shot of the lower ground. The caption could be improved by using more specific terminology for movement, such as \"slowly dollying forward,\" and by clarifying the cause of the perspective shift (e.g., \"The camera dollies forward from a low height over a steep drop-off, tilting down to follow the receding forest floor, which transitions the shot from a level to a high angle\"). Furthermore, while \"deep focus\" is noted, the caption could specify that focus is held across the foreground foliage, midground tree trunks, and background canopy, fully illustrating the large depth of field. Finally, the purpose of the movement is absent; the shot is likely intended to reveal the dramatic topography of the forest, a detail that would add significant context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with the camera at a low height just above the ground, slowly dollying forward through a forest. Initially, the camera maintains a level angle, but as it progresses over a steep drop-off, it tilts down to follow the receding forest floor. This movement transitions the shot from a level to a high angle, providing a clear view of the dramatic topography. The camera maintains deep focus, capturing the foreground foliage, midground tree trunks, and background canopy with a large depth of field. The steady movement and focus reveal the forest's intricate scenery and elevation changes.",
