    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially good but contains a significant error that fundamentally misrepresents the video's perspective. While it correctly identifies the focus and the nature of the movement, its description of the camera's position is inaccurate.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **`at a level angle`**: **Correct.** The camera is predominantly pointed straight ahead, parallel to the ground.\n    *   **`utilizing deep focus with a large depth of field`**: **Correct.** Everything from the immediate foreground to the distant background is in sharp focus.\n    *   **`The camera moves forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion`**: **Correct.** The camera is clearly moving forward, and the movement has the characteristic shakiness of being handheld by someone walking.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **`overhead-level camera`**: **Incorrect.** This is the most critical error. An \"overhead\" shot implies the camera is positioned directly above the scene, looking down (like a ceiling camera or a top-down map view). This video is shot from a **first-person perspective (POV)**, likely at **eye-level or chest-level**. This mistake completely changes the viewer's understanding of how the scene was filmed.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers focus and movement quality, which are key aspects of the video.\n*   It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard/absent, adhering to the instruction for conciseness.\n*   However, it misses the most important contextual descriptor: **first-person perspective (or POV)**. Identifying the shot as a POV would immediately explain the camera height, the forward movement, and the unsteady motion as being motivated by a person walking through the space. This is a significant omission that would have made the description much more informative.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise, which is good.\n*   **Informativeness:** It fails on this point due to the major inaccuracy regarding camera height. An informative description must first be accurate. By describing it as \"overhead-level,\" it becomes *misinformative*.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It correctly uses \"deep focus\" and \"unsteady motion.\" However, the term \"overhead-level\" is used incorrectly. A more precise term for the forward movement would be **\"dollying forward\"** or **\"tracking forward.\"**\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely describes the video according to your instructions:\n\n**\"This first-person perspective shot is filmed from an eye-level height at a level angle. The camera dollies forward at a walking pace with a natural, unsteady motion. A deep depth of field keeps the entire environment in sharp focus.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Accurate Perspective:** It immediately establishes the shot as a **\"first-person perspective\"** from an **\"eye-level height,\"** which is correct.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses the term **\"dollies forward\"** to accurately describe the camera's translational movement.\n*   **Comprehensive and Concise:** It covers all the key, non-standard elements (height, movement, focus) without unnecessary words, fully adhering to the instructions.",
