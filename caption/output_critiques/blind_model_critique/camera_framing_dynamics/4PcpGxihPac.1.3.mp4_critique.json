    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video is blurry, and the light is dim, making it hard to determine the focus type.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent, high-level summary but fails to meet the specific requirements of the instructions. It is inaccurate in its description of the camera movement and incomplete in its description of the focus and camera configuration. It lacks the technical terminology and detail mandated by the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The most significant error is identifying the camera movement as a **\"zoom in.\"**\n    *   **What's actually happening:** The camera is physically moving forward through the space, which is a **dolly in**. We can tell it's a dolly because objects at the side of the frame (the streetlights) exhibit parallax and move past the camera. A zoom would simply magnify the center of the frame, and the peripheral objects would remain in the same relative position, just larger.\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The description of the focus as **\"difficult to determine\"** is weak and slightly misleading.\n    *   **What's actually happening:** The focus state is very clear: the entire image is intentionally and completely **out-of-focus**. The instruction asks for a description of the focus plane, and in this case, the correct description is that there is **no focus plane**. The effect is not a mystery to be solved; it's a deliberate stylistic choice.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption omits the camera's height. The shot appears to be taken from **eye-level** or perhaps slightly lower, like from a car's dashboard.\n*   **Movement Details:** While it correctly notes the movement is \"smooth,\" it misses:\n    *   **Type:** It incorrectly identifies the movement (dolly, not zoom).\n    *   **Speed:** The dolly is at a **steady, moderate speed**.\n    *   **Purpose:** The movement serves to guide the viewer through the blurry, atmospheric cityscape.\n*   **Focus Details:** The description \"blurry\" is too generic. The instructions ask for more specific terms:\n    *   **Depth of Field:** This is a perfect example of an **ultra-shallow depth of field** where nothing is in focus.\n    *   **Focus Plane:** It fails to mention that there is **no discernible focus plane**.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** It doesn't explicitly state that the focus remains static (i.e., consistently out-of-focus throughout).\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Terminology:** The caption fails to use the specific technical vocabulary requested (e.g., `dolly in`, `depth of field`, `out-of-focus`, `eye-level`). The instructions are designed to elicit this precise language.\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which is good. However, it achieves this by sacrificing accuracy and required information. The goal is to be \"concise *yet informative*,\" and this caption leans too far into brevity at the expense of information.\n*   **Omissions:** It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard and not present, which does follow the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption (Example of a Good Caption)\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"From a smooth, eye-level, and level-angle perspective, the camera dollies forward at a steady pace. The entire shot is intentionally out-of-focus, with an ultra-shallow depth of field and no discernible focus plane, creating large, blurry bokeh from the city lights.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Accurate Movement:** Correctly identifies the movement as a **\"dolly forward.\"**\n*   **Complete Configuration:** Includes **\"eye-level\"** and **\"level-angle.\"**\n*   **Detailed Movement:** Describes the movement as **\"smooth\"** and at a **\"steady pace.\"**\n*   **Precise Focus Description:** Uses the correct terminology like **\"out-of-focus,\" \"ultra-shallow depth of field,\"** and specifies there is **\"no discernible focus plane.\"**\n*   **Informative:** It provides a much richer, more technical description of what is happening in the shot, fully adhering to the prompt.",
