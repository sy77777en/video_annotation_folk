    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It is accurate, complete, and adheres well to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **\"The camera is underwater at a low angle, looking up from below.\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned below the fish and coral, looking up toward the water's surface, which defines it as an **underwater**, **low-angle** shot.\n*   **\"It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the coral and fish clearly.\"**: This is also correct. Everything from the coral in the foreground to the fish in the midground and the water's surface in the background is in sharp focus. This demonstrates a **deep focus** / **large depth of field**.\n*   **\"The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking.\"**: This is accurate. The camera does not pan, tilt, dolly, or move in any way. It is a fixed, **static** shot.\n\n### Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows the instructions by including all the relevant information while omitting what isn't necessary:\n\n*   **Included Correctly**: It correctly identifies and describes the camera's **height** (underwater), **angle** (low angle), **focus** (deep focus), and **movement** (static).\n*   **Omitted Correctly**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video plays at a normal speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable barrel or fisheye distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon (the water surface) is level.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot.\n\nBy focusing only on the notable characteristics of the shot, the caption remains concise yet informative, exactly as the instructions requested. The phrasing is clear and uses the appropriate technical terms.",
