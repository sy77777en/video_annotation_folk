    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a model caption that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nYes, the caption is excellent. It is accurate, complete according to the rules, and perfectly adheres to the tone and level of detail requested in the instructions. It successfully balances being concise with being highly informative.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy:\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **\"static, slightly unsteady shot\"**: This is a precise and nuanced description. While the camera's position is fixed (static), there is a minimal, natural wobble characteristic of a handheld shot. Calling it \"slightly unsteady\" is more accurate than just \"static.\"\n*   **\"eye-level, level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level and is not tilted up or down, resulting in a straight, level perspective.\n*   **\"deep focus\"**: This is the most important and accurate observation. Both the man in the foreground and the house and trees in the background are sharp and in focus, which is the definition of deep focus (or a large depth of field).\n*   **\"...keeping the entire scene, from the man in the foreground to the house behind him, sharp and clear\"**: This clause correctly explains *what* \"deep focus\" means in the context of this specific video, identifying the sharp elements in the foreground and background.\n\n#### 2. Completeness:\nThe caption is complete because it includes all the relevant information while correctly omitting the non-applicable points, as per the instructions.\n\n*   **Included**: It correctly identifies and describes camera movement/steadiness, height, angle, and focus.\n*   **Correctly Omitted**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no visible barrel or fisheye distortion, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so there was no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus is fixed, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions needed to be described.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption follows every rule laid out in the prompt.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: The caption is a single, well-structured sentence that conveys a significant amount of technical information without being verbose.\n*   **Uses Specific Terminology**: It correctly uses the specified terms like \"static,\" \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Describes Key Configurations**: It successfully covers all the applicable points from the list: movement, steadiness, height, angle, and focus.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules**: It demonstrates a clear understanding of when *not* to include information (e.g., for regular speed or lack of distortion), which is a key part of creating a concise description.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a perfect example of what was requested. It is a professional, technical description that is both precise and easy to understand.",
