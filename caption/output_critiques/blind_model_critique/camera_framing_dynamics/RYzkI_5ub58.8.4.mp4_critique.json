    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the high-angle perspective and the general forward movement, it lacks the specificity and detail required by the instructions. For instance, it omits the significant *barrel distortion* that is likely present from a wide-angle underwater lens, which would cause the coral structures at the edges of the frame to curve outwards. The description of movement is also too basic; a more accurate caption would describe it as a slow, cautious *dolly-in*, perhaps combined with a slight *tilt down* to keep the lobster centered as the camera gets closer. The \"minor unsteadiness\" could be more precisely characterized as a gentle, floating wobble with slight, unintentional *rolling* as the operator swims. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention that the video is likely filmed in subtle *slow-motion* (e.g., 60fps played at 30fps) to enhance the serene underwater atmosphere and smooth out the camera's motion. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is noted, a better description would specify that the focus plane is sharpest across the midground, capturing both the lobster and the adjacent reef, while the distant blue water in the deep background is naturally hazy and less defined.",
