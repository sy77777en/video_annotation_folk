    "pre_caption": "From a level angle, the camera smoothly dollies backward and pedestals down. The shot begins with the East German emblem on the wall in focus.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** At the beginning, the shot only shows the badge on the wall in deep focus. As the camera moves back, the glass appears, and the focus gradually shifts to the glass, ultimately focusing on the glass in the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward and moving down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main camera movement and the rack focus, it lacks the specificity and nuance needed to fully capture the shot's composition and narrative impact. The description of the camera angle as simply \"level\" is incomplete; the shot likely begins at an eye-level, level angle focused on the emblem, but as it pedestals down, it concludes at a much lower height, perhaps table-level, resulting in a slight low angle on the glass. The movement itself, described as a dolly and pedestal, could be more precise; the camera appears to move diagonally backward and down simultaneously at a slow, deliberate pace, a crucial detail that defines the shot's rhythm. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the reveal more vividly. Instead of a \"glass appears,\" the video shows a half-full tumbler of amber liquid on a dark wood table rising into the frame from the bottom, a direct result of the pedestal-down motion. Furthermore, the initial framing is a tight medium shot on the circular East German emblem, and it ends in a close-up on the glass, a change in framing that emphasizes the shift in subject. Finally, explicitly mentioning the use of a shallow depth of field would better explain *why* the background emblem becomes so effectively blurred, highlighting the intentional visual separation between the public, political symbol and the private, personal object.",

The camera pedestals down to a lower, table-level height, creating a slight low angle on a half-full tumbler of amber liquid that rises into the frame on a dark wood table.
