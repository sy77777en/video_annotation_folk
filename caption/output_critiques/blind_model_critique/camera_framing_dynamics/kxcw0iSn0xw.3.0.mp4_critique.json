    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A video with a speed ramp effect where playback speed smoothly transitions between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the captioning process.\n\nOverall, the provided caption is **very good** but contains one minor inaccuracy that can be easily corrected. It successfully follows most of the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **Correct:** `\"The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow playback.\"` - This is perfectly accurate. The video clearly speeds up, slows down for the main action, and then speeds up again.\n*   **Correct:** `\"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle...\"` - This is an accurate assessment. The camera is not looking up or down at the subject and appears to be at the height of a standing person.\n*   **Correct:** `\"...using a shallow depth of field.\"` - Yes, the man is in sharp focus while the background buildings are clearly and softly blurred.\n*   **Correct:** `\"The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking.\"` - This is accurate. The frame is locked off, with no panning, tilting, dollying, or shaking.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** `\"...focusing on the man in the foreground...\"` - The man is more accurately described as being in the **midground**. The foreground is the space between the camera and the subject. In this video, the ground immediately in front of the camera is the foreground, and the man is positioned a short distance away, making him the midground subject.\n\n**2. Completeness: Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most prominent and important features required by the instructions: **video speed, camera height, camera angle, focus/depth of field, and movement (or lack thereof).**\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present (lens distortion, Dutch angle, shot transitions), which is a key part of the instruction.\n*   To be perfectly complete according to the instructions, it could have more precisely identified the focus plane as the \"midground,\" as noted above.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction: Excellent**\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is brief and to the point while still conveying the essential technical details of the shot.\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly avoids stating \"no lens distortion\" or \"regular playback speed,\" adhering to the rule to only mention features when they are present or altered.\n*   **Clarity:** The language used is clear and uses the correct terminology (speed ramp, shallow depth of field, static).\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the information, starting with the most noticeable effect (the speed ramp) and then describing the stable camera configuration.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very effective and follows the instructions well. Its only flaw is the minor misidentification of the subject's position as \"foreground\" instead of \"midground.\"\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption:\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the minor inaccuracy and slightly improves conciseness:\n\n**\"The video features a speed ramp effect, transitioning between fast and slow motion. The static, eye-level camera uses a shallow depth of field to keep focus on the man in the midground.\"**",
