    "pre_caption": "This unsteady shot cranes up in an arc around two people. It begins at a slightly high, eye-level angle and moves upward to a bird's-eye view directly above them. The camera continues its arc, finishing at a level but upside-down angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at eye level, then cranes around the two subjects; at 90 degrees it is directly above their heads, and at 180 degrees it returns to their height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera begins at a level-to-high angle, then arcs vertically around the two human subjects, rising to a bird’s-eye view above their heads before circling back to a level angle, now upside down.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is craning up in an arc.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption captures the general trajectory and focus, it could be more precise and detailed. The description of the starting position as both a \"slightly high angle\" and \"eye-level\" is contradictory; it likely begins from a high angle, positioned just above the subjects' heads. The phrase \"cranes up in an arc\" is a good summary, but it conflates three distinct movements: a pedestal up, an arc/track around the subjects, and, most critically, a 180-degree roll. The caption only implies this roll by stating the shot finishes \"upside-down,\" but it should explicitly name the movement for clarity. Furthermore, the description of the final position as a \"level...angle\" is ambiguous; it would be better to specify the final camera height relative to the subjects. The caption also misses the subtle but noticeable barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens, which is especially apparent at the start and end of the shot when the ground and horizon lines appear to curve away from the frame's center. Lastly, describing the shot as merely \"unsteady\" is too general; it would be more informative to specify that it has a slight, consistent wobble, characteristic of a drone adjusting its position in a light breeze, rather than the erratic shake of a handheld camera.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins from a high angle, positioned just above the subjects' heads, and cranes up in a complex movement that includes a pedestal up, an arc around the subjects, and a 180-degree roll. The camera transitions from a slightly high angle to a bird's-eye view directly above the subjects, maintaining deep focus throughout. The shot concludes with the camera upside-down at a height level with the subjects, capturing a unique perspective. Notably, the wide-angle lens introduces subtle barrel distortion, causing the ground and horizon lines to curve away from the frame's center at the start and end of the shot. The camera exhibits a slight, consistent wobble, indicative of a drone adjusting its position in a light breeze.",
