    "pre_caption": "The video features a handheld camera at eye level, capturing a man in the foreground. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's face. The camera angle is level but includes a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. The camera zooms in and out, matching the rhythm of the dance, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera, pointed at the subject's face, zooms in and out while rolling back and forth to match the rhythm of the dance.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good and effectively follows the instructions. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres well to the specified format and terminology.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical elements.\n*   **\"handheld camera at eye level\"**: Correct. The movement has the characteristic unsteadiness of being handheld, and the perspective is consistent with a person of average height holding the camera.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's face\"**: Correct. The background is clearly out of focus, isolating the subject. The focus remains locked on the man.\n*   **\"camera angle is level but includes a varying Dutch angle due to rolling\"**: Perfectly accurate. The camera is not looking up or down at the subject (level angle), but it frequently rolls on its axis, creating a dynamic and disorienting Dutch angle. Using the term \"rolling\" is precise and correct.\n*   **\"zooms in and out, matching the rhythm of the dance\"**: Correct. The camera performs several quick zooms that are synchronized with the man's energetic movements, fulfilling the instruction to describe the movement's purpose.\n*   **\"slight unsteadiness and some shaking\"**: Correct. The handheld nature results in constant small movements and occasional larger shakes. \"Slight\" is a reasonable descriptor, though one could also argue for \"moderate.\"\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is very complete, covering almost all the required points while correctly omitting those that are not present, as per the instructions.\n*   **Covered:** Camera height, angle, Dutch angle (rolling), movements (zooming, steadiness), focus (depth of field, focus plane), and purpose of movement.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption doesn't explicitly mention the subtle **panning** that occurs as the camera operator adjusts to keep the dancing man centered in the frame. However, this is a very minor detail, and its omission keeps the caption concise.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption excels at following the specific guidelines provided.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into four clear sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms like \"shallow depth of field,\" \"level angle,\" \"Dutch angle,\" and \"rolling.\"\n*   **Describes Purpose:** It successfully explains *why* the camera zooms (\"matching the rhythm of the dance\"), which adds valuable context.\n*   **Handles Omissions:** It correctly follows the rule to not mention standard features like regular video speed or the absence of lens distortion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe caption is excellent. It is a professional and accurate description that demonstrates a strong understanding of both the video content and the detailed instructions. The only potential improvement would be to mention the minor panning, but its absence does not detract from the overall high quality of the description.",
