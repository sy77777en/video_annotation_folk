    "pre_caption": "The video features an overhead camera at a high angle, looking down from about second-floor height. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The camera smoothly zooms in and pans left to track the racing cars, which become larger in the frame as they move. The movement is steady with minimal shaking, maintaining a clear view of the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming in and panning left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning leftward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good foundation, it oversimplifies the camera work and omits a key sequence. The initial description of an \"overhead camera at a high angle\" is slightly contradictory; \"high angle\" is more accurate, as the camera isn't positioned directly top-down. More importantly, the movement isn't just a simple pan and zoom. As the cars navigate a wide turn, the camera performs a smooth, counter-clockwise **arc** to keep the lead car centered, not just a linear pan. The speed of this movement is also dynamic; it starts slower as the cars exit the corner and visibly **accelerates** to match their speed on the straight, maintaining consistent lead room in the frame. The claim that \"all elements remain sharp\" is not entirely true; while the initial shot has a large depth of field, as the camera zooms in tightly on the lead car, the background grandstands and trees become noticeably softer, shifting to a more **moderate depth of field**. The caption also completely misses a **hard cut** to a **slow-motion** replay of an overtake maneuver. This second shot is from a **low-angle** perspective, just above track level, and uses a **shallow depth of field** to isolate the two dueling cars, with the background blurred into streaks of color, before cutting back to the main high-angle shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a high-angle camera view, positioned above the action but not directly overhead. It uses deep focus initially, ensuring clarity across the scene. As the racing cars navigate a wide turn, the camera executes a smooth, counter-clockwise arc to keep the lead car centered, dynamically accelerating to match the cars' speed on the straight and maintaining consistent lead room. As the camera zooms in on the lead car, the depth of field becomes more moderate, with the background grandstands and trees softening. The action is interrupted by a hard cut to a slow-motion replay of an overtake maneuver. This second shot is captured from a low-angle perspective, just above track level, employing a shallow depth of field to focus on the two dueling cars, with the background blurred into streaks of color, before returning to the main high-angle shot.",
