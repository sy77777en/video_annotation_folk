    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** \"This is a static shot from a hip-level camera with a level angle. A deep focus is used, keeping the speaker and the background elements sharp and clear.\"\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **mostly accurate and well-structured but contains one significant error** regarding camera height. It follows the instructions for conciseness and content but misidentifies a key aspect of the camera's configuration.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"static shot\"**: **Correct.** The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way throughout the video.\n    *   **\"hip-level camera\"**: **Incorrect.** The camera is positioned at or near the subject's eye level, not their hip. A hip-level shot would be positioned much lower, looking up at the subject's torso and face. This shot is framed from the chest up with a direct, neutral perspective, which is characteristic of an **eye-level** or **chest-level** height.\n    *   **\"level angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is aimed straight ahead, not tilted up (low angle) or down (high angle).\n    *   **\"A deep focus is used...\"**: **Correct.** Both the speaker in the midground and the whiteboard in the background are in sharp focus, indicating a large depth of field (deep focus).\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Good:** The caption correctly identifies the static nature of the shot, the camera angle, and the focus.\n    *   **Good:** It adheres to the instruction for conciseness by correctly omitting any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none of these are present or altered.\n    *   **Flawed:** While it attempts to describe camera height as instructed, the term used (\"hip-level\") is factually wrong for this video.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is good in its attempt to follow the instructions by covering the required elements concisely. However, the factual error in describing the camera height as \"hip-level\" instead of \"eye-level\" makes the description inaccurate.\n\n**A more accurate caption would be:**\n\n\"This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. A deep focus keeps both the speaker and the background elements sharp and clear.\"",
