    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is rolling clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This caption is a high-quality example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres very well to the specified format and terminology.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is highly accurate in its technical descriptions.\n\n*   **Camera Height:** `\"ground-level shot\"` is a perfect description. The camera is positioned very low, nearly on the same plane as the surface.\n*   **Camera Movement:** `\"smooth, continuous clockwise roll\"` is the most precise and correct way to describe the motion. It correctly identifies the movement as a **roll** (rotation around the lens axis), its direction (**clockwise**), and its quality (**smooth, continuous**).\n*   **Camera Angle:** The observation that the roll `\"creates a varying Dutch angle\"` is spot-on. The description of the perspective shifting `\"from a level to a high angle\"` is a very good interpretation of the *effect* of the roll on the viewer. While the camera itself isn't physically craning up, the rotation places the viewer's perspective \"above\" the action as the frame turns, effectively creating a high-angle view within the rotated composition.\n*   **Focus:** `\"shallow depth of field\"` is correct, as the background and immediate foreground are out of focus. `\"keeping the focus on the midground\"` is also accurate, as the hands and the object they are manipulating are the sharpest elements.\n\n### Completeness: Excellent\nThe caption successfully covers all the necessary points from the instructions without including superfluous information.\n\n*   **Covered:** It details camera height, angle (including the Dutch angle), movement (type, direction, steadiness), and focus (depth and plane).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured sentence that packs in a large amount of technical detail without feeling cluttered. It even manages to describe the on-screen action (\"a pair of hands unfolds a grey object\") as part of the focus description, which adds context efficiently.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specified technical terms correctly and effectively (e.g., `roll`, `Dutch angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `midground`).\n*   **Describing Movement:** It perfectly follows the instructions for describing movement by specifying the type, direction, and steadiness.\n*   **Describing Focus:** It correctly identifies the depth of field and the specific focus plane.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThis is an exemplary caption. It is technically precise, well-written, and follows the complex set of instructions almost perfectly. It successfully balances the need for technical detail with conciseness and clarity, making it a model example for the task. There are no significant errors or omissions.",
