    "pre_caption": "The video starts with the camera at eye level, initially using a high angle. It smoothly pans left and tilts upward to focus on a billboard. After two seconds, it slightly zooms in, pauses, and then gently tilts upward. The camera transitions to a low angle, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. The movements are smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera begins with a leftward pan and an upward tilt to focus on the billboard. After two seconds, there is a slight zoom in, followed by a brief pause in all motion. Then, the camera performs a gentle tilt upward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is well-structured and captures most of the key technical aspects of the video. However, there is one significant inaccuracy and room for minor improvements in precision.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption:\n\n---\n\n### **Feedback on Your Caption**\n\n**Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Correct:** Your description of the camera movements (pan left, tilt up, zoom in, pause, tilt up again) is perfectly accurate and follows the temporal sequence correctly. Your identification of the angle transition from high to low is also a great observation. The description of the focus (`deep focus with a large depth of field`) and steadiness (`smooth with minimal shaking`) is spot on.\n*   **What's Incorrect:** The most significant error is stating the camera is at **`eye level`**. The shot is clearly taken from a high vantage point, such as the window or balcony of a tall building, looking down at the street and across to another building. \"Eye-level\" implies the camera is positioned at the height of a person standing on the ground. A more accurate term would be **elevated** or **high-level**.\n\n**Completeness: Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most important elements required by the instructions: camera angle, movement, and focus.\n*   It correctly follows the rule of omission by not mentioning the normal video speed or the absence of lens distortion, which contributes to its conciseness.\n\n**Adherence to Instruction: Good**\n\n*   You followed the instructions to describe the sequence of movements, the change in camera angle, and the focus characteristics.\n*   The main point of non-adherence is the incorrect use of the `camera height` terminology provided in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised and Improved Caption**\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracy and refines the language for better precision, fully aligning with the instructions.\n\n**\"From an elevated position, the camera begins with a high angle, smoothly panning left and tilting up to frame a billboard. It then performs a slow zoom-in, pauses, and tilts up further, shifting the perspective to a low angle. The shot is very steady and maintains deep focus throughout.\"**\n\n### **Why This Version is Better**\n\n1.  **Corrects Height:** It replaces the inaccurate \"eye level\" with the correct term **\"elevated position.\"**\n2.  **Improves Precision:** It specifies the zoom is **\"slow\"** and clarifies that the final tilt shifts the **\"perspective\"** to a low angle.\n3.  **Conciseness and Flow:** It combines the initial movements into a single fluid phrase (\"panning left and tilting up\") which better reflects the continuous nature of the action.",
