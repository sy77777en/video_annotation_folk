    "pre_caption": "This unsteady, first-person point-of-view shot begins with a slight upside-down high-angle view of a person's hands laying bricks. As the person stands up, the camera moves upward with a slight counterclockwise roll, transitioning to a bird's-eye view of the construction site. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The initial frame is a slight upside-down high-angle shot. The ending frame is a bird's eye shot.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The first-person view camera moves upward while looking down at the ground as the person stands upright, incorporating a slight counterclockwise roll during the motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the general upward movement, it contains several inaccuracies and omissions based on the likely visuals. The initial description of a \"slight upside-down high-angle view\" is confusing; in the video, the character is bent over, creating a standard high-angle shot of their hands, but with a severe 45-degree clockwise Dutch angle, which the caption misinterprets as \"upside-down.\" The movement is not just \"upward\" but a clear *pedestal up* as the person stands, combined with a counterclockwise *roll* to level the horizon. Most significantly, the final shot is not a \"bird's-eye view,\" which would be a top-down aerial shot; instead, the character is standing on a second-story scaffold, resulting in a wide *high-angle view* of the site below. The claim of \"deep focus\" is also an overstatement; the shot uses a wide-angle lens with a large depth of field, but the focus is clearly fixed on the midground, leaving the bricks in the immediate foreground slightly soft at the start and the distant cranes noticeably out of focus. Finally, the caption fails to mention the prominent *barrel distortion* from the wide-angle lens, which is especially visible as the camera rolls, causing the straight lines of the building's frame to curve at the edges.",

As the person stands, the camera performs a pedestal up movement, combined with a counterclockwise roll to level the horizon. The final shot reveals a wide high-angle view from a second-story scaffold, overlooking the construction site below. The scene is captured with a wide-angle lens, resulting in a large depth of field focused on the midground, while the foreground bricks and distant cranes are slightly out of focus. Notably, barrel distortion from the lens causes the building's frame lines to curve at the edges, especially visible during the camera roll.",
