    "pre_caption": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera begins at hip level with a high angle, using deep focus to keep the ocean and distant shoreline sharp. It starts with a subtle forward movement toward the water, then smoothly pedestals down to ground level, maintaining a high angle and steady motion throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures the ocean, starting with a subtle forward movement before pedestaling down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres closely to the provided instructions. It successfully identifies and describes the key technical aspects of the video—lens distortion, camera position, focus, and movement—using the correct terminology in a concise manner.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Barrel Distortion:** **Correct.** The video does exhibit mild barrel distortion, noticeable in the slight curvature of the horizon. The description of its effect (\"causing straight lines near theedges to bow outward\") is precise.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** **Correct.** The shot begins at a plausible `hip level` with a `high angle` looking down towards the water. It accurately notes the final position as `ground level`.\n*   **Focus:** **Correct.** The video uses `deep focus`, keeping the foreground sand, midground waves, and distant horizon all sharp.\n*   **Camera Movement:** **Correct.** The caption accurately deconstructs the compound movement. It is a `subtle forward movement` combined with a `smooth pedestal down`. The description of the motion as `steady` is also accurate.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions that are present in the video:\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** Identified and described.\n    *   **Camera Height:** Start and end heights are noted (`hip level` to `ground level`).\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The `high angle` is correctly identified.\n    *   **Movement:** The type (`forward movement`, `pedestal down`), steadiness (`steady`), and sequence are all described.\n    *   **Focus:** `Deep focus` is correctly identified.\n*   It correctly omits aspects that are not present, adhering to the conciseness instruction. There is no mention of video speed, Dutch angle, or focus changes because they do not occur.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise yet packed with information, avoiding unnecessary words.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., `barrel distortion`, `high angle`, `deep focus`, `pedestals down`).\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the information, starting with static properties (distortion, focus) and then describing the dynamic movement from start to finish.\n\n### Minor Point for Perfection:\nThe phrase \"maintaining a high angle\" is a slight oversimplification, though acceptable for conciseness. As the camera pedestals down, its angle relative to the horizon becomes more level, even though it is still looking down at the sand directly in front of it. A more pedantically accurate description might be \"transitioning to a worm's-eye perspective of the sand while the angle relative to the horizon becomes more level.\" However, the current phrasing is perfectly understandable and effective.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\n**Yes, the caption is good.** It is an exemplary response that is accurate, detailed, and perfectly aligned with the complex instructions provided. It effectively translates the visual and technical elements of the video into a clear and concise description.",
