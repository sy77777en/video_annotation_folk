    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **accurate** in what it describes but is **highly incomplete** and does not adhere to the detailed requirements of the caption instruction. It identifies the most obvious camera movement but omits several other key technical and stylistic elements requested.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n*   **\"very smooth pull-back shot\"**: This is **correct**. The camera movement is exceptionally steady, with no discernible shake or wobble. \"Pull-back\" is an accurate term for the camera moving backward (dollying out).\n*   **\"moving backward away from the central silhouetted figure\"**: This is also **correct**. It accurately describes the direction of movement and the primary subject of the shot.\n\nThe caption is factually correct in every statement it makes.\n\n#### 2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to include most of the specific details required by the instructions. Here is a breakdown of the missing information:\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption omits that the shot begins from a **low angle** and a **low height** (approximately hip-level or lower). This is a significant choice, as it initially makes the silhouetted figure appear more prominent and heroic against the sky.\n*   **Camera Movement (Complexity & Secondary Motion):**\n    *   While it correctly identifies the \"pull-back\" (translation backward), it misses the subtle but important **upward movement** (a pedestal up or slight crane up). The camera doesn't just move back; it also rises, which enhances the feeling of revealing the vastness of the landscape.\n    *   It doesn't specify the **slow and steady speed** of the movement.\n    *   It doesn't mention the **purpose** of the movement, which is to start with a focus on the individual and pull back to reveal their context within a majestic, expansive environment.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The video uses a **deep depth of field** (deep focus). The silhouetted figure in the foreground, the water in the midground, and the clouds and sun in the background are all in sharp focus simultaneously. This is a critical stylistic choice that ensures the entire beautiful scene is visible and appreciated. The caption makes no mention of focus at all.\n*   **Conciseness vs. Information:** The instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative\" description. The provided caption prioritizes conciseness to the point where it is no longer sufficiently informative according to the detailed list of requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more fully adheres to your instructions while remaining reasonably concise:\n\n**\"Starting from a low angle, the camera performs a slow and smooth pull-back, moving backward and craning slightly upward to reveal the vast landscape behind a central silhouetted figure. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the figure, water, and sunset sharp throughout.\"**\n\n#### Why this version is better:\n\n*   **Covers Angle & Height:** Mentions the \"low angle.\"\n*   **Details Movement:** Describes the primary \"pull-back\" and the secondary \"craning slightly upward\" motion, as well as the \"slow and smooth\" speed and steadiness.\n*   **Describes Focus:** Explicitly states that the shot uses \"deep focus,\" explaining its effect.\n*   **Balances Conciseness and Detail:** It incorporates all the key missing information without being overly long or technical.",
