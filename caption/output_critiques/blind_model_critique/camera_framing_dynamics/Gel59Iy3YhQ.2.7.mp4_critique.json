    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, concise, and effectively captures the most important visual and technical elements of the video. It successfully follows the instruction to omit unnecessary information (like normal video speed and lack of distortion) while providing a clear and informative description. The feedback below focuses on minor areas where it could be even more precise according to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n\n*   **\"slightly unsteady\"**: Correct. There is a gentle, organic sway to the camera, suggesting a handheld or simulated handheld movement.\n*   **\"eye-level shot\"**: Correct. The camera's height is consistent with a person's natural viewpoint.\n*   **\"deep focus that keeps the entire landscape sharp\"**: Correct. All planes of the image—the foreground cave walls, the midground trees, and the background hills—are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"camera moves forward from a dark, cave-like opening\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the camera's direction and starting environment.\n*   **\"revealing a stylized, misty river scene...\"**: Correct. This perfectly describes the purpose of the camera movement and the content of the scene.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very good but could be slightly more complete by including a few specific terms mentioned in the instructions.\n\n*   **Camera Angle**: The caption mentions camera **height** (\"eye-level\") but omits the camera **angle**. In this case, it is a **level angle**, as the camera is parallel to the ground.\n*   **Movement Terminology**: The caption uses the general term \"moves forward.\" The instructions provide the more technical term **\"dollying forward,\"** which would be a more precise description.\n*   **Movement Speed**: The caption doesn't explicitly state the speed of the movement (e.g., \"slowly\" or \"at a steady pace\"), which is a detail requested in the instructions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates excellent adherence to the core principles of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption is commendably concise. It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all standard/absent, just as the instructions advise.\n*   **Key Elements Covered**: It successfully covers steadiness, height, focus, movement direction, and the purpose of the movement.\n*   **Areas for Stricter Adherence**: To adhere even more strictly to the technical vocabulary requested, the terms \"level angle,\" \"dollying forward,\" and the movement's speed could be incorporated.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback to be more technically complete according to the instructions, while maintaining clarity.\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n> This is a slightly unsteady, eye-level, level-angle shot with a deep focus. The camera slowly dollies forward out of a dark, cave-like opening, revealing a stylized, misty river scene where the entire landscape remains sharp.",
