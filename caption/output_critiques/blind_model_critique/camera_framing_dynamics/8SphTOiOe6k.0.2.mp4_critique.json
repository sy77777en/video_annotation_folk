    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans from left to right for most of the video. Near the end, it moves slightly forward as the cameraman walks.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **mostly good but contains a significant inaccuracy** regarding the camera movement. While it correctly identifies several key aspects like camera height, angle, and focus, its description of the movement's timing is incorrect, which misrepresents how the shot unfolds.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **\"shot at eye level with a level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is held at a height and angle consistent with a person looking straight ahead while walking.\n    *   **\"maintaining deep focus throughout\"**: This is correct. Both the midground (street, pedestrians) and the background (buildings) remain in focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n    *   **\"The camera smoothly pans from left to right\"**: This is correct. The primary rotational movement is a smooth pan to the right.\n    *   **\"maintaining steadiness\"**: This is also accurate. For a handheld shot, the movement is very stable with only minimal, natural wobble from walking.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"Near the end, it moves slightly forward as the cameraman walks\"**: This is the main error. The forward movement is not isolated to the end of the shot. The camera is **moving forward (dollying) continuously throughout the entire pan**. The pan and the forward dolly are simultaneous actions from the beginning to the end of the clip. The caption incorrectly separates them into a sequence.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What it covers well:** The caption successfully includes the required information on camera height, angle, focus, and the primary rotational movement (pan).\n*   **What's missing or incomplete:** The description of the movement is incomplete because it fails to capture the **simultaneous nature** of the pan and the forward dolly. The instructions ask for a description of how multiple movements combine, and the caption simplifies this to the point of being incorrect. It also uses the general term \"moves forward\" instead of the more precise term \"dolly,\" though \"moves forward\" is acceptable.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Excellent Adherence:**\n    *   The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise and **omits unnecessary information**. It does not mention the regular video speed, the lack of lens distortion, or the absence of a Dutch angle, which is perfect.\n*   **Poor Adherence:**\n    *   The caption fails to adhere to the instruction to describe multiple movements in their correct **temporal order or combination**. By stating the forward movement happens \"near the end,\" it creates a false sequence of events (pan first, then move forward) instead of describing the actual simultaneous action.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a steady, eye-level perspective with a level angle and deep focus, the camera simultaneously pans smoothly from left to right while dollying forward at a walking pace to reveal the street scene.\"**",
