    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving left to right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of your caption based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"This is a side-scrolling shot where the camera smoothly tracks the small, white character, moving from left to right to follow its actions.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\nThe caption is perfectly accurate.\n*   **\"Side-scrolling shot\"**: Correctly identifies the genre and primary camera motion.\n*   **\"smoothly tracks the small, white character\"**: Accurately describes the camera's steady movement, its type (tracking), and its subject.\n*   **\"moving from left to right\"**: Correctly states the direction of movement.\n*   **\"to follow its actions\"**: Correctly identifies the purpose of the camera movement.\n\nEvery statement in the caption correctly describes what is happening in the video.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Lacking\n\nThe caption is too concise and omits several key details required by the instructions.\n\n**Missing Information:**\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption does not specify the camera angle (**level angle**) or its height relative to the subject (**character-level** or **eye-level**). This is a key descriptor for a 2D side-view.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** The caption completely omits any description of the focus. A critical feature of this 2D animation style is that all planes (foreground character, midground trees, background mountains) are perfectly in focus. This should have been described as **deep focus** or noted as having an artificial sharpness with no depth of field, as per the instructions.\n*   **Movement Specifics:** While \"tracks\" is correct, the instructions also list \"trucking\" for side-to-side movement. Combining these terms can provide more technical detail (e.g., \"trucks right to track the character\").\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Needs Improvement\n\nThe caption follows the instruction for conciseness but fails to meet the requirement of being \"informative\" enough by leaving out mandatory descriptive categories.\n\n*   **What it did well:** It correctly omitted details that were not present (video speed alteration, lens distortion, Dutch angle, shot transitions), which aligns with the goal of being concise. It also correctly identified the primary movement and its purpose.\n*   **Where it fell short:** It failed to adhere to the explicit instructions to describe **camera angle**, **camera height**, and **focus/depth of field**. The instructions state to describe these elements, and they are clearly discernible in the video. The caption prioritized brevity over the required level of detail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a good, accurate, but incomplete summary of the video's camera work. It serves as a solid foundation but does not fulfill all the requirements of the detailed instructions. To be considered a \"good\" caption *according to the specific rules provided*, it needs to include the missing information about the camera's angle, height, and the video's focus characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n\"From a **level, character-height angle**, the camera **smoothly trucks right to track** a small white character across the screen. The shot maintains a **deep focus**, keeping the character in the foreground and all background layers perfectly sharp in this 2D side-scrolling view.\"",
