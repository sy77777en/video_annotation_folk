    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is at an aerial level, maintaining a mostly level angle despite intense movements. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone gradually moves forward with subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to focus on the apartment building. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera maintains a mostly level angle, but due to intense camera movements, the exact angle relative to the ground plane is difficult to determine.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone gradually moves forward with subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to focus on the apartment building.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but contains several significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's angle and the nature of its movement. While it correctly identifies some key aspects like the aerial perspective and deep focus, its description of the motion is misleading.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nHere is a point-by-point breakdown of the caption's accuracy:\n\n*   **\"The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward.\"**\n    *   **Partially Accurate.** There is noticeable lens distortion, characteristic of a wide-angle lens often used on drones. However, \"fisheye\" implies a much more extreme, hemispherical effect. A more precise term would be **barrel distortion**, where straight lines bow outwards from the center. The description of the effect (\"causing straight lines to curve outward\") is correct.\n\n*   **\"The camera is at an aerial level, maintaining a mostly level angle despite intense movements.\"**\n    *   **Inaccurate.**\n        *   \"Aerial level\" is **correct**.\n        *   \"Maintaining a mostly level angle\" is **incorrect**. A level angle is parallel to the ground. This camera is pointed downwards at a **high angle** throughout the shot.\n        *   \"despite intense movements\" is **highly inaccurate**. The camera movement is slow, smooth, and deliberate, not \"intense\" in any way.\n\n*   **\"It uses deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**\n    *   **Accurate.** The entire scene, from the nearby snowy ground to the distant buildings, is in sharp focus. This is a perfect description.\n\n*   **\"The drone gradually moves forward with subtle upward and downward motions while panning left to focus on the apartment building.\"**\n    *   **Partially Accurate.**\n        *   \"Gradually moves forward\" (dollying) is **correct**.\n        *   \"Panning left\" is **correct**.\n        *   \"to focus on the apartment building\" correctly identifies the **purpose** of the movement.\n        *   \"subtle upward and downward motions\" is **inaccurate**. The camera performs a slow, continuous **descent** (pedestaling down); it does not bob up and down.\n\n*   **\"The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\"**\n    *   **Accurate.** The shot is very stable, likely due to a gimbal. \"Minimal shaking\" is a fair description, though \"no noticeable shaking\" would be even more accurate.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers lens distortion, camera height, focus, and the primary types of movement (translation and rotation).\n*   It correctly omits mentions of video speed and Dutch angle, as they are standard/absent, adhering to the conciseness instruction.\n*   It fails to correctly identify the **camera angle (high angle)** and mischaracterizes the vertical movement, describing it as \"upward and downward\" instead of a continuous **pedestal down**.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is reasonably concise.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses some correct terms (panning, deep focus) but fails to use the correct term for the camera angle (high angle) and the vertical movement (pedestal down). It also uses a highly subjective and incorrect descriptor (\"intense\").\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the movement is confusing and inaccurate (\"intense,\" \"upward and downward\"), which detracts from the caption's overall clarity and utility.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely describes the video according to your instructions:\n\n**The video displays noticeable barrel distortion from a wide-angle lens. Shot from an aerial level with a consistent high angle, the camera uses deep focus to keep the entire snowy landscape sharp. The camera executes a slow and smooth compound movement, simultaneously dollying forward, panning left, and pedestaling down to reframe from a wide view onto a specific apartment building.**",
