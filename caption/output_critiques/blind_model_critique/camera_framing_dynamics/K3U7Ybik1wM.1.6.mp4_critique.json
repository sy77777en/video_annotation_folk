    "pre_caption": "From a slightly unsteady, first-person perspective at eye level, the camera begins with a bird's-eye view, looking down at a person's bare feet walking on a stone patio. As the person continues walking forward, the camera tilts up to a level angle, revealing a grassy field, and then pans slightly to the left. The shot maintains a deep focus throughout, keeping both the patio and the distant field sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The first-person camera starts with a bird's-eye view, looking directly at the ground as the person walks forward. As the walk continues, it tilts up to a level angle and ends with a pan to the left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good** but contains **one significant inaccuracy** and a few areas for minor improvement in technical precision. It successfully captures the feel and sequence of the shot while adhering to most of the structural and conciseness rules.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the perspective (\"first-person\"), steadiness (\"slightly unsteady\"), height (\"eye level\"), the sequence of movements (walking, tilting up, panning left), and the focus (\"deep focus\") are all accurate and well-described.\n*   **Key Inaccuracy:** The most significant error is a misuse of terminology. The caption states the camera begins with a **\"bird's-eye view.\"**\n    *   **Why it's inaccurate:** A bird's-eye view is a shot taken from directly overhead (a 90-degree angle to the subject), as if a bird were looking straight down. A person looking down at their own feet is a **high-angle shot**, not a bird's-eye view. This is a critical distinction in cinematography.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is quite complete, but could be slightly more precise according to the most technical aspects of the instructions.\n\n*   **What it covers well:**\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"slightly unsteady\" is perfect.\n    *   **Height & Angle:** It correctly identifies the height and the change in angle (from high to level).\n    *   **Movements:** It correctly identifies the `tilt` and `pan`. The forward motion is described as \"walking forward,\" which is an excellent, intuitive description for a first-person shot.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly identifies the \"deep focus\" and explains what is in focus (patio and field).\n    *   **Purpose:** It notes the purpose of the tilt is to \"reveal a grassy field.\"\n\n*   **What could be added for technical completeness:**\n    *   **Movement Type:** The instruction lists \"dollying\" for forward/backward movement. While \"walking forward\" is more descriptive for a POV shot, a technically complete caption might say the camera **dollies forward** (as the character walks).\n    *   **Movement Purpose:** The purpose of the initial forward movement (to cross the patio) and the final pan (to adjust the final framing) are implied but not explicitly stated. This is a minor omission and the current level of detail is acceptable for conciseness.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions very well, particularly regarding conciseness and structure.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** **Excellent.** The caption correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, correctly assuming they are normal/absent. This shows a strong understanding of the instruction to \"not mention\" standard attributes.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses `tilts up`, `pans`, `level angle`, and `deep focus`. The only failure in terminology is the misuse of \"bird's-eye view.\"\n*   **Structure:** The description of camera movement is presented in perfect temporal order: \"begins with... As the person continues... the camera tilts up... and then pans.\" This is exactly what the instructions requested.\n*   **Perspective:** Using the phrase \"first-person perspective\" is a smart and concise way to summarize the camera's motivation, its height, and its unsteady nature all at once. While not explicitly listed in the instructions, it's a highly effective descriptor that aligns with the goal of being \"concise yet informative.\"\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion and Revised Caption\n\nThe caption is strong, clear, and follows the rules of the prompt. Its only major flaw is the inaccurate use of \"bird's-eye view.\" By correcting that single term, the caption becomes almost perfect.\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracy and slightly refines the technical language:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\n> From a slightly unsteady, first-person perspective at eye level, the camera dollies forward, starting at a **high angle** looking down at bare feet on a stone patio. It then **tilts up** to a **level angle** to reveal a grassy field before **panning slightly left**. The shot maintains a **deep focus** throughout, keeping both the foreground patio and the distant field sharp.",
