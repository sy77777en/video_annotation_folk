    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at an overhead level, maintaining a level angle with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera smoothly follows the perspective of a forward-moving train, initially moving straight ahead. As the train changes direction, the camera pans to the right, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the perspective of a forward-moving train. It continuously moves forward and then pans to the right as the train switches the direction of its locomotive to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a very good and accurate description of the video, adhering closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** \"Overhead level\" is an appropriate description for a camera on an elevated train, high above the ground. \"Level angle\" is also correct, as the camera looks straight ahead, parallel to the ground, not tilted up or down.\n*   **Focus:** \"Deep focus and a large depth of field\" is perfectly accurate. All elements, from the nearby tracks to the distant buildings, are in sharp focus.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is precise. The camera does move forward with the train (\"follows the perspective of a forward-moving train\") and then \"pans to the right\" as the track curves. The movement is indeed very smooth, so \"maintaining steadiness\" is also correct.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary information. As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles because they are standard or absent.\n*   **Required Elements:** The caption successfully includes all the relevant configurations present in the video:\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"overhead level\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level angle\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus and a large depth of field\"\n    *   **Movement:** It clearly describes the initial forward motion and the subsequent pan, including its direction (\"right\") and steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"maintaining steadiness\").\n*   **Terminology:** The caption uses the correct technical term \"pans\" to describe the camera's horizontal rotation, demonstrating a good understanding of the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the detailed instructions, resulting in a description that is technically accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of the relevant details, and efficiently concise. It successfully translates the visual information into a structured and informative text.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an elevated, level-angle view from a camera that maintains deep focus and a large depth of field. It smoothly tracks the perspective of a forward-moving train, initially proceeding straight. As the train curves, the camera pans right, maintaining a steady and fluid motion throughout.",
