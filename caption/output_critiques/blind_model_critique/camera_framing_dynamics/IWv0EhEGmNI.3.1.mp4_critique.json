    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera in a first-person shooting game shows the player following a teammate from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It is accurate in what it states and successfully captures the general feel of the video. However, it misses several key details specifically requested by the comprehensive instructions, particularly concerning the technical description of camera movement.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in all the points it makes:\n*   **\"smooth, first-person perspective in a video game\"**: Correct. The movement is fluid, lacks any real-world camera shake, and is clearly from a first-person POV within a game engine.\n*   **\"camera follows a teammate from behind\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the primary action.\n*   **\"positioned at eye level with a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera's height and angle are consistent with a character looking straight ahead.\n*   **\"maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field\"**: Perfectly correct. This is a key visual characteristic of many video games where everything from the immediate foreground to the far background is in sharp focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Fair\n\nThis is the main area for improvement. The caption is concise, but in doing so, it omits several details the instructions explicitly ask for.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n\n*   **Specific Movement Terminology:** The instruction asks for specific movement types like *tracking, dollying, panning, etc.* The caption uses the general verb \"follows.\" While true, it's not the technical description required. The camera is simultaneously **dollying forward** (moving through space) and **tracking** the teammate.\n*   **Steadiness:** The caption mentions \"smooth,\" which implies steadiness, but it doesn't explicitly state that the camera is **perfectly steady** with no shake or wobble, a key feature of in-game cameras.\n*   **Speed of Movement:** The instructions ask for the speed of movement. The caption doesn't mention that the camera moves at a **consistent walking/jogging pace**.\n*   **Confirmation of Omissions:** While the instructions state you don't need to mention things that aren't there (like lens distortion or speed changes), a more thorough description might briefly confirm the shot is at **regular speed** to be fully comprehensive.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Good\n\nThe caption adheres well to some parts of the instructions but falls short on others.\n\n**Strengths in Adherence:**\n*   It correctly identifies and describes **camera height**, **camera angle**, and **focus/depth of field**.\n*   It correctly follows the rule of not mentioning non-existent features like **lens distortion**, **Dutch angles**, or **video speed alterations**.\n\n**Weaknesses in Adherence:**\n*   The primary lack of adherence is in the **\"movements\"** section. The instructions provide a detailed list of terms (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, tracking, speed, complexity, purpose). The caption simplifies this to \"follows,\" failing to use the specific vocabulary requested.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption (Example of Higher Adherence)\n\nHere is a revised caption that more fully incorporates the instructions, providing a model for what a complete description would look like:\n\n**\"From a smooth, first-person perspective in a video game, the camera dollies forward at a steady walking pace, tracking a teammate from behind. The shot is framed at eye-level with a level angle and is perfectly steady. A deep focus and large depth of field keep the entire environment, from the foreground character to the distant background, consistently sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Uses Technical Terms:** Replaces \"follows\" with the more precise **\"dollies forward\"** and **\"tracking.\"**\n*   **Specifies Steadiness:** Explicitly states the camera is **\"perfectly steady.\"**\n*   **Describes Speed:** Adds that the movement is at a **\"steady walking pace.\"**\n*   **Maintains Accuracy:** Retains all the correct observations from the original caption (eye-level, level angle, deep focus).",
