    "pre_caption": "This first-person game camera shot smoothly follows the player moving forward down a set of stairs and into a pool. The camera, which features mild barrel distortion, makes slight, mouse-like tilts and pans. It begins at eye-level and transitions to just above the water, maintaining a level angle and a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The first-person game camera shows the player walking forward down the stairs into a pool. It slightly tilts and pans, giving the impression of being controlled with a mouse.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and concise.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement as a \"first-person game camera shot\" that \"smoothly follows the player moving forward\" is perfectly accurate. The use of \"slight, mouse-like tilts and pans\" is an exceptionally precise and insightful way to describe the subtle, player-controlled adjustments typical of this perspective.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** The caption correctly identifies the \"mild barrel distortion\" visible at the edges of the frame. It accurately notes the camera's starting height (\"eye-level\"), its transition (\"to just above the water\"), and the consistent \"level angle.\"\n*   **Focus:** The observation of a \"deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp\" is correct. In many video games, the entire scene is rendered in focus, and the caption captures this technical detail perfectly.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions without including unnecessary information.\n*   **Included:** It correctly details the camera's movement (translation, rotation, steadiness), height and angle transitions, lens distortion, and focus.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:** As per the instructions, it does not mention:\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** There is no tilt in the horizon.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static and deep throughout.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that packs a significant amount of information without being wordy. It avoids redundancy and gets straight to the point.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It effectively uses the specified terminology like \"barrel distortion,\" \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" \"tilts and pans,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Descriptive Quality:** The caption doesn't just list technical terms; it uses them to build a clear and vivid picture of the shot. Phrases like \"smoothly follows\" and \"mouse-like tilts\" are both technical and descriptive.\n*   **Logical Flow:** The description follows a logical order, starting with the overall action and perspective, then moving to specific technical details like distortion, movement nuances, height, and focus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a perfect execution of the instructions. It demonstrates a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of cinematographic and technical language, applying it effectively to a video game context. It is a benchmark example of a high-quality description.",
