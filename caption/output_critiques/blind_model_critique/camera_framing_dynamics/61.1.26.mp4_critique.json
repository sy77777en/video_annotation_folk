    "pre_caption": "The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the foreground. The camera arcs around her in a counter-clockwise direction, then slightly arcs back. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** \nThe camera arcs around the female character in a counter-clockwise direction, then slightly arcs back in the opposite direction at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the initial eye-level framing, the shallow depth of field on the woman, and the primary counter-clockwise arcing movement. However, it misses a crucial detail: as the camera lowers from eye-level to achieve the low angle, it is also tilting upward to keep the woman's face and upper body centered in the frame. This combined pedestal down and tilt up movement is a significant part of the shot's dynamic feel. The description \"slightly arcs back\" is also a bit vague; a more precise phrase like \"briefly reverses the arc\" or \"performs a short clockwise counter-arc\" would better describe the camera's subtle change in direction as it reframes her against the blurred city lights in the background. Furthermore, while the focus is correctly identified as shallow, the caption omits that the focus is actively tracking the woman. As she sways slightly while performing, the focus plane subtly shifts to maintain her sharpness, which is a crucial element of the shot's professional quality. Finally, the \"slight unsteadiness\" is characteristic of a handheld gimbal shot, which could be specified to provide a more technical and complete picture of the camera's configuration.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera starts at eye level with a level angle and transitions to a low angle while tilting upward to keep the woman's face and upper body centered in the frame. It employs a shallow depth of field, actively tracking the woman in the foreground to maintain her sharpness as she sways slightly. The camera arcs around her in a counter-clockwise direction and briefly reverses the arc with a short clockwise counter-arc, reframing her against the blurred city lights in the background. The movement is slightly unsteady, characteristic of a handheld gimbal shot, adding to the dynamic feel of the scene.",
