    "pre_caption": "The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the foreground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** \nThe camera arcs around the female character in a counter-clockwise direction, then slightly arcs back in the opposite direction at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The caption is highly accurate and adheres well to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, concise, and uses the correct terminology as specified in the instructions. It successfully captures the key technical and stylistic elements of the shot in a clear and understandable way.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle.\" — This is perfectly accurate. The shot begins looking straight at the woman and transitions to a slightly lower angle as the camera moves, making her appear more prominent against the background.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the woman in the foreground.\" — This is correct. The background is softly blurred (bokeh), clearly indicating a shallow depth of field that isolates the subject.\n*   **Camera Movement:** \"The camera arcs around her in a counter-clockwise direction, then slightly arcs back.\" — This is a precise description of the camera's path. It follows a semi-circular trajectory around the subject.\n*   **Steadiness:** \"The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\" — This is also accurate. The shot has the distinct micro-jitters of a handheld camera, not the perfect smoothness of a gimbal or dolly.\n\n**2. Completeness: Very Good**\nThe caption covers the most important aspects requested in the instructions. It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., lens distortion, speed changes, Dutch angle), which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n\n*   **What it covers well:** Height, angle, depth of field, movement type, direction, and steadiness.\n*   **Minor point for even greater precision:** The instructions mention describing `focus tracking`. While \"focusing on the woman\" is correct, a more technical description would be that the camera uses **focus tracking** to keep the woman sharp as both she and the camera move, maintaining the focus plane on her. However, for conciseness, the current phrasing is perfectly acceptable.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is a model of conciseness. It avoids redundant phrases and gets straight to the point without sacrificing critical information.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms from the instructions like `eye level`, `low angle`, `shallow depth of field`, and `arcs`.\n*   **Structure:** The information is presented in a logical order, starting with the static properties (height, focus) and then describing the dynamic ones (movement).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of how to apply the given instructions. It is accurate, informative, and concise. There are no significant errors or omissions. The minor point about \"focus tracking\" is a nuance for hyper-technical accuracy but does not detract from the overall high quality of the provided caption.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera is at eye level and initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle, making the woman appear more prominent against the background. It uses a shallow depth of field with focus tracking to keep the woman sharp as both she and the camera move, isolating her from the softly blurred background. The camera arcs around her in a counter-clockwise direction, then slightly arcs back, following a semi-circular trajectory. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, characteristic of a handheld camera.",
