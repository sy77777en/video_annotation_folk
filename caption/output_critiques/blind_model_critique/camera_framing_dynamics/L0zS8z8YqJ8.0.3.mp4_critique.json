    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera starts off in deep focus. The words on the map are unclear due to distance. After the camera zooms in on the German Stadium figure, the focus shifts to shallow focus with only the foreground in focus. The sign for the German Stadium becomes noticeably clearer than those for the two other landmarks.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward and down to approach the map on the table, with a slight pan to the left at both the beginning and end of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption provides a detailed and accurate description that adheres well to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The description of starting from a \"high angle\" and \"transitioning from eye level to hip level\" is precise and accurately captures the camera's vertical position and perspective relative to the scene.\n*   **Movement:** The primary movement is correctly identified as \"forward and down.\"\n*   **Focus:** The description of the focus change is the strongest part of the caption. It correctly identifies the initial \"deep focus,\" the transition to a \"shallow depth of field,\" and the final focus plane (\"the German Stadium model and its label\").\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The phrase \"The shot begins and ends with a slight pan to the left\" is slightly misleading. The camera doesn't pan, stop, and then move forward. Instead, it performs a continuous, compound movement, simultaneously moving forward, down, and panning slightly left throughout the shot. The pan is part of the main motion, not a separate action at the beginning and end.\n\n**2. Completeness: Very Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most critical and dynamic elements requested: **angle, height, movement (translation and rotation), and focus (depth, plane, and change).**\n*   It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as these are not present, which aligns with the instruction for conciseness.\n*   A minor omission is the **steadiness** of the camera. The movement is very smooth and stable, which could have been mentioned (e.g., \"the camera moves smoothly...\").\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is a great example of this principle. It packs a significant amount of technical information into two clear sentences without being overly verbose or jargony.\n*   **Covers Key Configurations:** It effectively details the camera's setup and dynamic changes as required.\n*   **Describes Dynamic Changes:** It excels at describing the transitions in height (\"transitioning from eye level to hip level\") and focus (\"the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **very good** and almost perfectly fulfills the prompt's requirements. Its description of the focus pull is exemplary. The only point of weakness is a slight inaccuracy in how it describes the panning motion, separating it from the main camera movement when it is, in fact, integrated.\n\n### Revised Caption for Improved Accuracy\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the minor inaccuracy and incorporates the camera's steadiness:\n\n\"From a high angle, the camera smoothly moves forward, down, and slightly to the left, transitioning from eye level to hip level as it approaches a map on a table. The shot begins in deep focus, but as the camera moves, the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field, sharpening the German Stadium model and its label while blurring the background.\"",
