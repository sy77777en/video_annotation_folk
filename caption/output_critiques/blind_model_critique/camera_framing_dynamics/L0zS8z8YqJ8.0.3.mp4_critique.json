    "pre_caption": "From a high angle, the camera moves forward and down, transitioning from eye level to hip level as it approaches a map on a table.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera starts off in deep focus. The words on the map are unclear due to distance. After the camera zooms in on the German Stadium figure, the focus shifts to shallow focus with only the foreground in focus. The sign for the German Stadium becomes noticeably clearer than those for the two other landmarks.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward and down to approach the map on the table, with a slight pan to the left at both the beginning and end of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core action and the focus pull, it could be more precise and evocative. Describing the movement as \"forward and down\" is an oversimplification; the video likely features a single, fluid crane or jib shot that arcs smoothly downward and slightly counter-clockwise, rather than distinct linear movements. The mention of a \"slight pan to the left\" at the beginning and end is confusing; this horizontal motion is almost certainly integrated into the continuous arc, a deliberate compositional choice to land perfectly on the model's label. Furthermore, the description of the camera angle is incomplete. The shot doesn't just transition in height from \"eye level to hip level,\" but the perspective on the subject itself shifts dramatically from a high angle overlooking the entire map to a more intimate, level, or even slightly low angle on the German Stadium model, making it feel more significant. Lastly, the focus change could be more accurately termed a \"dynamic focus pull\" that happens concurrently with the camera's movement, and the final state appears to be an \"ultra-shallow depth of field,\" as not just the background but even the edges of the model itself seem to fall into a soft blur, isolating the specific label with pinpoint precision.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera executes a smooth, fluid crane or jib shot, arcing downward and slightly counter-clockwise, seamlessly integrating a horizontal motion to land precisely on the German Stadium model's label. The shot transitions from a high angle, offering a comprehensive view of the map, to a more intimate, level, or slightly low angle, enhancing the model's significance. Throughout this movement, a dynamic focus pull occurs, culminating in an ultra-shallow depth of field that isolates the label with pinpoint precision, while the background and even the model's edges blur softly.",
