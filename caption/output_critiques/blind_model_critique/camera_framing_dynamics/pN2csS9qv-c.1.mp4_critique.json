    "pre_caption": "The video captures cheerleaders celebrating. The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The handheld camera begins with a slight but very unsteady pan to the right, capturing the celebration, and concludes with a subtle dolly zoom out. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera captures the cheerleaders celebrating, beginning with a slight but very unsteady pan to the right and concluding with a subtle dolly zoom out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is mostly accurate and follows the instructions well, but there is one significant technical error and a minor point on conciseness that could be improved.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** You correctly identified the shot is at **eye level** with a **level angle**.\n    *   **Focus:** The description of **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"** is accurate. All the cheerleaders in the group are reasonably sharp, with no significant background or foreground blur.\n    *   **Movement Type (Pan):** Identifying the initial movement as an **\"unsteady pan to the right\"** is perfect.\n    *   **Steadiness:** Noting that the camera is **handheld** and the movement is **unsteady with shaking** is also correct.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   The term **\"dolly zoom out\"** is inaccurate. A dolly zoom (also known as a \"Vertigo effect\") is a very specific and complex technique where the camera dollies in one direction (e.g., forward) while simultaneously zooming in the opposite direction (e.g., out). This keeps the subject the same size in the frame while the background appears to compress or expand dramatically.\n    *   In this video, the camera operator simply moves backward to get a wider view of the group. This movement is a **\"dolly out.\"** There is no evidence of a simultaneous zoom.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the key required elements: camera height, angle, focus, and movement (type and steadiness).\n*   It correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting mentions of normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n*   The description of the movement's purpose (\"capturing the celebration\") is implicitly understood and well-integrated.\n\n### Conciseness and Clarity\n\n*   The caption is mostly concise. However, the description of the camera's instability is mentioned twice: first as a \"very unsteady pan\" and then again in the final sentence, \"The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\" These could be combined for a more streamlined description.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good and demonstrates a strong understanding of most camera terminology. The misidentification of the \"dolly out\" as a \"dolly zoom\" is the only major flaw.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that corrects the error and improves conciseness:\n\n**\"Shot from an eye-level, level angle, the video uses deep focus to keep the celebrating cheerleaders sharp. The handheld camera movement is unsteady throughout, beginning with a pan to the right and concluding with a dolly out to widen the frame.\"**",
