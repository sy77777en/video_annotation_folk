    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video features artificially created moving light dots, making it unclear whether the camera itself is moving.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nIt is far too simplistic and fails to address most of the specific parameters required by the instructions. It correctly identifies the artificial nature of the video and the smoothness of the motion, but it misinterprets or avoids describing the key visual elements.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"The video features artificially created moving light dots...\"**: This is **accurate**. The scene is clearly computer-generated.\n*   **\"...making it unclear whether the camera itself is moving.\"**: This is **inaccurate and a poor description**. While it's an animation, the visual language is that of a camera moving. The instruction asks you to describe the camera's perceived movement. The effect is an unambiguous forward motion through space. Stating it's \"unclear\" is an evasion of describing the primary action in the video. The effect is created by the dots moving past the frame, which simulates a **dolly forward** movement of the camera.\n*   **\"The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\"**: This is **accurate**. It correctly describes the steadiness of the shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (Where the caption fails significantly)\n\nThe caption omits almost all of the required descriptive elements:\n\n*   **Camera Movement (Type, Speed, Purpose):** It fails to identify the specific type of movement, which is a **dolly forward** (or a simulated one). It doesn't mention the **constant speed** or the **purpose** (to simulate travel through space).\n*   **Camera Angle:** It misses describing the **level angle** of the camera, which is looking straight ahead.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The video has a distinct visual characteristic: a complete lack of realistic depth of field. All dots, whether appearing near or far, are in perfect, sharp focus. The instructions specifically state: *\"If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial.\"* The caption should have noted the **artificial deep focus**, which reinforces that the scene is computer-generated.\n*   **Lens Distortion & Video Speed:** The caption correctly omits these as they are standard/not present, which aligns with the conciseness rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the core instruction: \"Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**.\"\n\n*   It is concise but **not informative**.\n*   It does not describe the camera's configuration regarding **angle** or **focus**.\n*   It actively avoids describing the most prominent **camera movement** by calling it \"unclear.\"\n\n---\n\n### Revised, Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that correctly follows the instructions:\n\n**\"The camera performs a steady, continuous dolly forward at a constant speed, simulating travel through a field of multi-colored light dots. The shot maintains a level angle and has an artificial deep focus, where all elements remain perfectly sharp regardless of their apparent distance, indicating a computer-generated scene.\"**",
