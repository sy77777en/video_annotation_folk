    "pre_caption": "From an unsteady, eye-level, first-person perspective, the camera starts at a high angle. It pans left and tilts down to track a fire extinguisher as it falls to the floor.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video starts at a high angle, and pans left to track the fire extinguisher on the wall falling to the ground. Then the camera tilts up to show the cabin wall panel falling and tracks it going up and down. Finally, the wall panel falls to the ground, and the camera tilts down.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the player's perspective. It first pans left, then tilts down with a slight pan to the right. Next, it tilts up as light blinks, and finally, it follows the movement of the panel.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption for the video.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good and captures most of the key elements correctly, but it contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the camera angle and could be more precise in describing the angle changes.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy: **Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Perspective & Steadiness:** The description of an \"unsteady, eye-level, first-person perspective\" is perfectly accurate. The camera movement clearly mimics a person looking around in a chaotic environment.\n    *   **Movement:** The sequence of movements—\"pans left and tilts down to track a fire extinguisher,\" \"tilts up to follow a wall panel,\" and \"tilts down, following the panel as it crashes\"—is described correctly and in the right order.\n    *   **Focus:** Identifying the \"deep focus\" is correct. All elements from the foreground to the background remain sharp throughout the shot.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The statement that the camera **\"starts at a high angle\" is incorrect.** The camera begins at a **level angle**, looking straight ahead at the fire extinguisher on the wall. It only adopts a high angle *after* it tilts down to look at the extinguisher on the floor.\n\n#### Completeness: **Good but Incomplete**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers perspective, height, steadiness, a sequence of movements, and focus.\n    *   It correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as they are not present, adhering to the conciseness instruction.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Dynamic Angle Changes:** The instructions ask to note shifts in the camera angle. The caption misses the full range of these shifts. The camera moves from a **level angle** -> **high angle** (looking down at the floor) -> **low angle** (looking up at the falling panel) -> **high angle** (looking down at the crashed panel). Mentioning these transitions would make the description more complete and accurate.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions: **Very Good**\n\n*   The caption does an excellent job of following the instructions to be concise yet informative.\n*   It uses the correct terminology (pan, tilt, track, deep focus, eye-level).\n*   It correctly describes the purpose of the camera movements (\"to track,\" \"to follow\").\n*   It correctly identifies that the video is a single, continuous shot by not mentioning any transitions.\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that addresses the inaccuracies and adds the missing details:\n\n**\"From an unsteady, eye-level, first-person perspective, the camera starts at a level angle. It pans left and tilts down, shifting to a high angle to track a fire extinguisher as it falls. The camera then tilts sharply up into a low angle to follow a detaching wall panel as it moves erratically. Finally, it tilts back down to a high angle, tracking the panel as it crashes to the ground. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire chaotic scene sharp.\"**",
