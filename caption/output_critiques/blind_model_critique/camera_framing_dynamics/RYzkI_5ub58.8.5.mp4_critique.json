    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a highly accurate and well-constructed description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is 100% accurate.\n    *   The shot is indeed **static** in its intent, but the minor hand-held shake makes **\"slightly unsteady\"** a precise and correct qualifier.\n    *   The camera is positioned directly in front of the subject, not looking up or down, making **\"level angle\"** the correct term.\n    *   The background is clearly out of focus while the monkey is sharp, which is a perfect example of a **\"shallow depth of field\"**.\n    *   The focus is correctly identified as being on the **\"monkey in the foreground\"**.\n\n*   **Completeness & Conciseness:** The caption strikes an excellent balance between being informative and concise, as requested by the instructions.\n    *   **What it includes:** It correctly identifies and describes the most prominent and defining features of the shot: its steadiness, angle, and focus.\n    *   **What it omits (correctly):** It follows the instructions by not mentioning aspects that are standard or absent. There is no need to state \"regular video speed,\" \"no lens distortion,\" or \"no Dutch angle,\" and the caption wisely leaves these out to maintain conciseness.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption demonstrates a thorough understanding of the prompt.\n    *   **Movement:** It correctly identifies the shot as \"static\" and adds the crucial detail about its \"unsteady\" nature.\n    *   **Angle:** It specifies the \"level angle.\"\n    *   **Focus:** It describes both the depth of field (\"shallow\") and the focus plane (\"foreground\").\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions.\n\n### Potential Minor Improvement\n\nWhile the caption is already excellent, if you wanted to be even more descriptive, you could add the camera height relative to the subject:\n\n*   **Example:** \"This is a slightly unsteady static shot from an **eye-level**, level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the monkey in the foreground in focus.\"\n\nHowever, this is a very minor addition. The existing caption is already top-tier and successfully fulfills all requirements of the prompt.",
