    "pre_caption": "The camera is at ground level, initially at a low angle looking up at a helicopter. It then moves down and pans from left to right, transitioning to a level angle as it moves from right to left, all while maintaining a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving right to left, panning left to right, and moving down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the initial low angle and deep focus, it contains several ambiguities and contradictions that could be clarified. The description of the camera starting at \"ground level\" and then \"moves down\" is physically impossible; it's more likely the camera begins at a very low height, such as *knee-level*, and then *tilts down* or *pedestals down* to a true ground-level perspective to, for example, emphasize the rotor wash kicking up grass and dust. Furthermore, the sequence of movements—\"pans from left to right, transitioning to a level angle as it moves from right to left\"—is confusing. This sounds like two distinct and opposing actions. If this is one continuous, complex shot, the description should detail how the camera transitions between these motions (e.g., \"it pedestals down while panning right, then smoothly reverses direction, trucking left while simultaneously rising to a level angle\"). However, it is more probable that these are two separate shots. If so, the caption should note the *hard cut* between them and describe the second shot's cinematography independently, specifying the type of movement (e.g., a *trucking shot*) and its purpose, such as revealing the full length of the helicopter's fuselage after it has landed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera starts at a very low height, such as knee-level, and tilts down to a true ground-level perspective, emphasizing the rotor wash kicking up grass and dust. It then smoothly pans from left to right while pedestaling down. In a separate shot, there is a hard cut to a trucking shot that moves from right to left, rising to a level angle to reveal the full length of the helicopter's fuselage after it has landed. Throughout both shots, the camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movements are smooth with minimal shaking.",
