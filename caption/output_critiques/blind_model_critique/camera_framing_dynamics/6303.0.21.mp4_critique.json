    "pre_caption": "The video features a high-angle camera at eye level, focusing on a man in the midground with a shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly moves forward, following the man from behind.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good starting point—it's concise and captures the general feel of the shot. However, it contains a significant factual error and misses some key details required by the instructions, particularly regarding specific camera terminology.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"high-angle camera\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned above the subject and looking down on him.\n    *   **\"focusing on a man in the midground\"**: Correct. The man is the subject, and he occupies the midground of the frame.\n    *   **\"with a shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The background is clearly out of focus, isolating the subject.\n    *   **\"The camera smoothly moves forward, following the man from behind\"**: Correct. The movement is smooth, forward, and follows the subject.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"at eye level\"**: This is a direct contradiction to \"high-angle.\" An eye-level shot is filmed from the subject's eye height with a level angle. This camera is positioned **above eye-level**, which is what creates the high-angle perspective.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (Adherence to Instructions)\n\nThe caption is concise, but it omits several specific details requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Movement Terminology:** The instruction asks for specific terms like *tracking, dollying, panning, etc.* While \"moves forward, following the man\" is descriptive, it could be more precise. This is a classic **tracking shot** (as it follows a subject) and also a **dolly forward** (as the entire camera apparatus moves forward).\n*   **Missing - Focus Dynamics:** The instruction asks to describe focus changes like *rack focus* or *focus tracking*. In this video, the focus remains locked on the man as he moves forward. This is an example of **focus tracking**, which is a key technical detail that was omitted.\n*   **Missing - Camera Height Description:** The caption incorrectly identifies the height. A more accurate description would be **above eye-level** or simply stating that the high angle is achieved by placing the camera at a high elevation.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Negative Constraints (What it did well)\n\nThe caption correctly followed the instruction to be concise and omit unnecessary information. It did not mention:\n*   **Video Speed:** Because it's at a regular speed.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** Because there is none.\n*   **Dutch Angle:** Because the horizon is level.\n\nThis shows a good understanding of when *not* to include information.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the errors and incorporates the missing details, fully adhering to your instructions:\n\n**\"From a high angle and an above eye-level height, the camera smoothly tracks a man from behind as he walks. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field with continuous focus tracking, keeping the man in the midground sharp while the camera dollies forward.\"**",
