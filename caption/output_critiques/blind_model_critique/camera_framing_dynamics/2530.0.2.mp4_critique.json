    "pre_caption": "The video captures a close-up of ballet shoes at ground level, with the camera positioned at a level angle. It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the ballet shoes in the foreground. The camera exhibits minor, unsteady movements with noticeable shaking, lacking clear or intentional motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a high-quality and accurate description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by including all relevant details while correctly omitting standard or absent features.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback Breakdown\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it presents:\n\n*   **\"close-up of ballet shoes at ground level, with the camera positioned at a level angle\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera is very low to the floor (**ground level**) and looking straight at the subject (**level angle**), not from above or below. The framing is a **close-up**.\n*   **\"employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the ballet shoes in the foreground\"**: This is spot-on. The front shoe is in sharp focus, while the background is heavily blurred, which is characteristic of an **extremely shallow depth of field**. The **focus plane** is correctly identified as the **foreground**.\n*   **\"The camera exhibits minor, unsteady movements with noticeable shaking, lacking clear or intentional motion\"**: This is an excellent and nuanced description of the camera movement. The camera is not static, but its movement isn't a deliberate pan, tilt, or dolly. It has the subtle, high-frequency vibration and slight drift of a handheld shot, which is perfectly captured by the words **\"unsteady,\" \"shaking,\"** and **\"lacking clear or intentional motion.\"**\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption correctly includes all the necessary elements present in the video while omitting those that are not, as per the instructions.\n\n*   **Included Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** `ground level`\n    *   **Camera Angle:** `level angle`\n    *   **Focus:** `extremely shallow depth of field`, `focusing on the ballet shoes in the foreground`\n    *   **Movement:** `minor, unsteady movements with noticeable shaking`\n\n*   **Correctly Omitted Elements:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static on the foreground; there is no rack focus or tracking, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions precisely.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into just three clear sentences without any fluff.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses the exact terminology suggested in the instructions (e.g., \"ground level,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"shaking\").\n*   **Logical Structure:** It logically groups related information: first framing/position, then focus, and finally movement.\n*   **Omission of Standard Features:** It correctly follows the rule to not mention regular speed, lack of distortion, or lack of a Dutch angle, which contributes to its conciseness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the given instructions. It is a professional, accurate, and efficient technical description of the video. No improvements are needed.",
