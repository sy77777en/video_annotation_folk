    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Let's break down the caption based on the detailed instructions.\n\nOverall, the caption is **very good**. It is accurate, concise, and uses the correct terminology as requested by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, employing deep focus for a large depth of field. The camera smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the subject.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Excellent.** The caption accurately describes a very specific and common type of shot.\n    *   **\"eye level with a level angle\"**: Correctly identifies the camera's height and angle.\n    *   **\"deep focus for a large depth of field\"**: Correctly describes the focus. The phrase is slightly redundant since \"deep focus\" implies a large depth of field, but it is not incorrect and adds clarity.\n    *   **\"smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the subject\"**: This is a perfect description of the movement. It uses the correct term (\"arcs\"), specifies the direction (\"counterclockwise\"), describes the quality of motion (\"smoothly\"), and states the purpose (\"around the subject\").\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Good, but could be slightly more detailed.** The caption does a great job of being concise, but it omits a few details that are mentioned in the instructions.\n    *   **What it does well:** It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, adhering to the rule: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"*\n    *   **Minor Omissions:**\n        *   **Steadiness:** While \"smoothly\" implies a steady shot, the instructions list \"steadiness\" as a separate point. Explicitly stating the shot is \"steady\" or \"stable\" would make it more complete.\n        *   **Speed of Movement:** The caption says \"smoothly\" but doesn't specify the speed (e.g., slow, moderate, fast). Adding a word like \"slowly\" would add more information.\n        *   **Focus Changes:** It correctly identifies \"deep focus\" but doesn't explicitly state that the focus is *static* or that there are no focus changes (like a rack focus), which is an important detail for a complete description.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Excellent.** The caption follows the instructions very closely.\n    *   **Conciseness:** It is concise and informative, avoiding unnecessary jargon or filler words.\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as **\"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\"** and **\"arcs.\"**\n    *   **Structure:** It logically groups the camera's static properties (height, angle, focus) before describing its movement, which makes it easy to understand.\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendation\n\n**The caption is good and effectively fulfills the core requirements of the instructions.** It is a strong example of a concise and accurate description.\n\nTo make it perfect and fully comprehensive according to the detailed instructions, you could make minor additions:\n\n**Slightly Improved Version:**\n\"The steady, eye-level camera maintains a level angle and static deep focus. It moves in a smooth, slow counterclockwise arc around the subject.\"\n\n**Why this version is slightly better:**\n*   **\"Steady\"**: Explicitly addresses the camera's steadiness.\n*   **\"Static deep focus\"**: Clarifies that the focus does not change during the shot.\n*   **\"Slow\"**: Adds a specific detail about the speed of the movement.\n\nEven without these additions, the original caption is a high-quality response to the prompt.",
