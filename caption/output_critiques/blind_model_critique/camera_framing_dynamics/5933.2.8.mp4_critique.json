    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at ground level and angled high, looking down. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground, specifically on the legs of a person walking through tall grass. The camera moves slowly forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at ground level and angled high, looking down. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground, specifically on the legs of a person walking through tall grass. The camera moves slowly forward with noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady motion.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation:**\n\nThe caption is **good but contains one significant error** regarding the camera angle. It successfully captures most of the key visual elements as required by the instructions, but the inaccuracy in terminology detracts from its overall quality.\n\n### **Detailed Feedback:**\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Correct:** The caption is accurate in identifying the **slow motion** video speed, the **ground-level** camera height, the **shallow depth of field**, and the focus on the **midground** (the person's legs).\n*   **Correct:** It accurately describes the camera movement as moving **slowly forward** and correctly notes the **noticeable shaking** and **unsteady motion**.\n*   **Incorrect:** The description of the camera angle as **\"angled high, looking down\"** is a major error. According to the instructions, a \"high angle\" is when the camera is positioned above the subject and looks down. In this video, the camera is at ground level looking *up* at the person's legs, which is a classic **low angle**. The phrase \"angled high, looking down\" is contradictory and misinterprets the standard definitions of camera angles.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is very complete. It covers all the relevant aspects present in the video:\n    *   **Video Speed:** Mentioned (\"slow motion\").\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** Mentioned (though the angle is wrong).\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** Clearly described.\n    *   **Camera Movement & Steadiness:** Well-detailed.\n*   It correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details about lens distortion and Dutch angle, as neither is present.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the structure and content requirements, using specific terms like \"slow motion,\" \"ground level,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"midground.\"\n*   The primary failure in adherence is the incorrect application of the \"high angle\" term, which goes against the definitions provided in the instructions.\n\n### **Conclusion and Suggested Improvement:**\n\nThe caption is effective but flawed. To make it fully accurate and compliant with the instructions, the description of the camera angle must be corrected.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n\nThe video is in slow motion. The camera is at **ground-level with a low angle**, tracking a person's legs as they walk through tall grass. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the legs in the midground in sharp focus. The camera moves forward unsteadily with noticeable shaking.",
