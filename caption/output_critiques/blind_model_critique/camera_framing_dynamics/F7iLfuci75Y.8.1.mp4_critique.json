    "pre_caption": "From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves forward at a level angle. As it approaches a large vault-like door, it performs a quick right pan to reorient itself. Following the pan, the camera continues its forward motion while gradually descending. The video begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the door, before transitioning to a deep focus that brings the figures working at computers in the background into sharp view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video begins with a shallow focus with the middle ground in focus. As the camera moves, it transitions into a deep focus with all elements visible.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward continuously, quickly panning right to adjust its orientation as it nears the door. After the pan, it gradually descends while maintaining its forward motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a highly accurate, complete, and well-written description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions. It successfully balances technical detail with clear, concise language.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in its description of the video's technical elements.\n\n*   **\"From a smooth, hip-level perspective, the camera moves forward at a level angle.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The movement is very steady (\"smooth\"), suggesting a gimbal or Steadicam. The height is appropriately identified as \"hip-level,\" and the camera maintains a \"level angle\" without tilting up or down initially.\n*   **\"As it approaches a large vault-like door, it performs a quick right pan to reorient itself.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The camera's rotation to the right is a \"pan,\" and its speed is accurately described as \"quick.\" The purpose (\"to reorient itself\") is also correctly identified.\n*   **\"Following the pan, the camera continues its forward motion while gradually descending.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The camera resumes its dolly forward and simultaneously begins a pedestal down movement, which is perfectly summarized as \"continues its forward motion while gradually descending.\"\n*   **\"The video begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the door, before transitioning to a deep focus that brings the figures working at computers in the background into sharp view.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The focus and depth of field analysis is spot on. It correctly identifies the initial \"shallow depth of field\" with the focus plane on the midground (the door) and the subsequent transition to \"deep focus\" where the background becomes clear.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete, covering all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **Included Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"hip-level,\" \"descending.\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level angle.\"\n    *   **Movements:** \"moves forward\" (dolly), \"right pan,\" \"descending\" (pedestal down).\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"smooth.\"\n    *   **Speed:** \"quick\" pan, \"gradually\" descending.\n    *   **Purpose:** \"to reorient itself.\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"shallow depth of field,\" \"deep focus,\" \"focusing on the door,\" \"brings the figures... into sharp view.\"\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so this was correctly omitted as per the instructions.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there was no need to mention transitions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions precisely.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The description is efficient and avoids unnecessary words while capturing all the critical technical details.\n*   **Clarity:** It uses clear, descriptive language (e.g., \"vault-like door,\" \"figures working at computers\") that is easy to understand.\n*   **Temporal Order:** The events are described in the correct sequence: initial forward movement, the pan, the final forward/downward movement, and the overarching focus change.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly uses terms like \"pan,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate in every detail, complete in its coverage of relevant points, and written in a clear, concise, and well-structured manner. No improvements are necessary.",
