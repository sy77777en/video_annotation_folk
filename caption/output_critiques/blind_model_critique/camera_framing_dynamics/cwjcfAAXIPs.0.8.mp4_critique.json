    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from a slightly unsteady, first-person perspective at eye-level, with mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera moves forward until it stops at the shoreline. It then follows the photographer's actions, tilting up and panning smoothly from left to right to frame the foggy harbor. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp from the foreground to the distant background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera follows the photographer's first-person perspective, steadily moving forward. Upon reaching the shoreline, the movement halts. The photographer then aims to capture the sea, causing the camera to tilt up and pan smoothly from left to right, matching their motions as it reveals the expansive view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the first-person perspective, barrel distortion, and deep focus, it could be more precise and evocative. The phrase \"follows the photographer's actions\" is slightly confusing for a first-person view; it would be clearer to state that the camera operator *is* the photographer, perhaps by noting that their hands briefly enter the frame to adjust a lens on a separate camera before the main pan begins. The description of the initial movement as \"slightly unsteady\" is good, but could be enhanced by specifying it as a \"natural, rhythmic bobbing motion from walking on the sandy shore.\" The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the shot's structure, failing to mention that the entire sequence is captured in a single, continuous take, which is a key stylistic choice. Furthermore, the description of the final movement could be more detailed; instead of just \"tilting up and panning smoothly,\" it could specify the sequence and purpose more clearly, such as: \"After a brief, deliberate pause at the water's edge, the camera tilts up to clear the foreground rocks, then begins a slow, sweeping pan from left to right, gradually revealing the full expanse of the foggy harbor and the distant silhouettes of sailboats.\" This adds a sense of narrative progression—the walk builds anticipation, the pause creates a moment of reflection, and the slow pan serves as the final reveal.",
