    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at ground level and maintaining a level angle. It features a fixed Dutch angle throughout.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** This video is too blurry to discern the camera focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions. Here is a breakdown of the provided caption's quality.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **mostly good but contains one significant inaccuracy** regarding the focus. It successfully identifies several key camera and video attributes concisely, but its description of the focus misinterprets a deliberate stylistic choice (shallow depth of field) as a technical flaw (general blurriness).\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Highly Accurate:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** \"The video is in slow motion\" is correct. The water droplets and splashes are moving much slower than in real life.\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"positioned at ground level\" is perfectly accurate. The camera is extremely low, capturing the puddle from its edge.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"maintaining a level angle\" is correct. The camera is not tilted up or down; it looks straight across the surface of the water.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** \"It features a fixed Dutch angle throughout\" is an excellent and accurate observation. The horizon line (the curb in the background) is clearly tilted and remains so for the duration of the shot.\n    *   **Camera Movement & Steadiness:** \"The camera moves to the right with slight unsteadiness and some shaking\" is a precise description. The movement is a horizontal translation to the right, and it is not perfectly stabilized.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Focus:** \"The video is too blurry to discern specific focus details\" is incorrect. The video is not uniformly blurry; it exhibits a clear and intentional **shallow depth of field**. The blur is a creative tool, not a flaw. We can discern the following focus details:\n        *   **Focus Plane:** The focus is set on the **midground**, where the main droplet hits the water and creates the splash.\n        *   **Depth of Field:** The background (the curb and grass) and the immediate foreground are intentionally and heavily blurred, which isolates the subject (the splash).\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is quite complete, covering most of the required elements: video speed, camera height, camera angle, Dutch angle, and camera movement (direction and steadiness).\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as lens distortion, zooming, or complex movements, which adheres to the instruction for conciseness.\n*   The main area of incompleteness is the **lack of a proper description of the focus**. Instead of describing the shallow depth of field and the focus plane as instructed, it dismisses the topic entirely.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully follows the instructions to be concise and to describe video speed, camera configuration (height, angle), and movement.\n*   It correctly identifies and includes the **Dutch angle**, as specifically requested by the instructions.\n*   It fails to adhere to the detailed instruction regarding **focus**. The instruction asks to describe \"depth, focus plane, focus changes,\" but the caption does not provide this information, instead making an inaccurate claim about blurriness.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"The slow-motion video is shot from a ground-level, level angle with a fixed Dutch angle. The camera trucks slowly to the right with slight unsteadiness. It utilizes a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground splash in sharp focus while the foreground and background remain heavily blurred.\"**",
