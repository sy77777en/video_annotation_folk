    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions. Here is a thorough breakdown of your caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, concise, and captures the most important visual and technical elements of the shot. However, it could be slightly more complete and technically precise by incorporating a few more specific terms from the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions:\n*   **\"unsteady\"**: Correct. The camera is clearly handheld and has a natural, shaky motion.\n*   **\"eye-level\"**: Correct. The camera height is consistent with being held by a person standing and walking.\n*   **\"tracking shot that moves forward, following a man from behind\"**: Perfect. This accurately describes the camera's movement (translation forward), its purpose (tracking), and its relationship to the subject.\n*   **\"maintains a shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The background is clearly out of focus, isolating the subject.\n*   **\"keeping the man... in focus as he moves away\"**: Correct. The focus plane remains on the man even as his distance from the camera changes.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is good but misses a few details that could be included for full compliance with the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Angle:** The instructions ask for the camera angle (e.g., *level angle, low angle*). In this video, the camera is pointed straight ahead, making it a **level angle**.\n*   **Partially Complete - Focus:** The caption accurately describes the *effect* of the focus change (\"keeping the man... in focus as he moves away\"). However, the instructions provide the specific technical term for this: **focus tracking**. Using this term would make the description more technically complete.\n*   **Partially Complete - Focus Plane:** The caption mentions the man is in the \"foreground.\" This is true at the start, but as he moves away, he transitions toward the **midground**. Mentioning this transition would add precision.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the spirit and most of the rules of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption does an excellent job of being concise. It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none of these are present or altered, following the rule: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"*\n*   **Terminology:** It successfully uses key terms like \"unsteady,\" \"eye-level,\" \"tracking shot,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\" As noted above, it could be improved by also using \"level angle\" and \"focus tracking.\"\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback to be more complete and technically precise, while remaining concise.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\nThis is an unsteady, eye-level tracking shot at a level angle, moving forward to follow a man from behind. The shot uses a shallow depth of field with focus tracking to keep the man sharp as he walks from the foreground toward the midground.\n\n**Why it's an improvement:**\n*   It adds **\"at a level angle\"** to fully describe the camera's orientation.\n*   It replaces the descriptive phrase \"keeping the man in focus as he moves away\" with the more technical and precise term **\"focus tracking.\"**\n*   It more accurately describes the subject's position in space by noting his movement **\"from the foreground toward the midground.\"**",
