    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is very good and adheres well to the instructions. It is accurate, concise, and uses the correct terminology.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video is shot at eye level with a high angle, looking down. It features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone in the midground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\n*   **\"shot at eye level with a high angle, looking down\"**: This is an accurate and effective description. \"Eye-level\" correctly identifies the likely height of the person holding the camera, while \"high angle\" accurately describes the camera's downward tilt relative to the subject (the phone on the table).\n*   **\"shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone in the midground\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The phone is in sharp focus, while the background (laptop, wall) is clearly blurred. The phone is correctly identified as being in the midground of the scene.\n*   **\"The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\"**: This is an excellent description of the camera's state. It correctly notes the absence of deliberate movements (panning, tilting, etc.) while also capturing the subtle, natural shake of a handheld shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Good\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most prominent and important features required by the instructions: **camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and movement/steadiness.**\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, as per the instructions. There is no altered **video speed**, no significant **lens distortion**, and no **Dutch angle**, so mentioning their absence is unnecessary and would violate the conciseness rule.\n*   The only minor point for improvement would be to explicitly state that the focus is static (i.e., no rack focus or focus tracking occurs), but this is strongly implied by the description and its omission keeps the caption concise.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is a model of conciseness. It packs all the essential information into three clear, well-structured sentences without any filler words.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., `high angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `midground`, `unsteady`).\n*   **Follows Negative Constraints:** It correctly avoids mentioning standard video speed or the absence of distortion, which demonstrates a good understanding of the instruction to only describe what is present or altered.\n*   **Movement Description:** It accurately describes the camera as \"fixed but slightly unsteady,\" which is a perfect summary for a shot with no intentional movement but minor hand-held shake.\n\n### Suggested Improvement for Perfection\n\nWhile the caption is already excellent, a slight rephrasing could make the height/angle relationship even clearer and more precise.\n\n**Slightly Improved Version:**\n\n> From an eye-level position, the camera aims down in a high-angle shot with a shallow depth of field. The focus is fixed on the phone in the midground, and the camera remains stationary but for a slight unsteadiness.\n\nThis version combines a few elements for greater conciseness and explicitly mentions the \"fixed\" focus, but your original caption is arguably more direct and just as effective.\n\n**Conclusion:** The original caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the instructions. It is accurate, gets straight to the point, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical aspects of the shot.",
