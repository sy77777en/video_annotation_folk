    "pre_caption": "This shot features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. Positioned just above the water, the camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves smoothly toward the exit of the pool, intermittently panning left with brief pauses to adjust its direction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves toward the exit of the pool, intermittently panning left with brief pauses to adjust its direction.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a highly accurate and well-structured description of the video, perfectly adhering to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in describing the visual and technical elements of the video:\n*   **\"mild barrel distortion\"**: This is correct. The straight lines of the pool edge and the building in the background show a slight outward curve near the frame's edges, which is characteristic of barrel distortion.\n*   **\"Positioned just above the water\"**: This accurately describes the camera's very low height relative to the water's surface.\n*   **\"maintains a level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is pointed straight ahead, parallel to the ground, and the horizon is not tilted.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: This is a perfect description. Everything from the water ripples in the foreground to the distant building is in clear, sharp focus.\n*   **\"moves smoothly\"**: The camera movement is very stable and fluid, without any noticeable shaking or wobbling.\n*   **\"toward the exit of the pool\"**: This correctly identifies the primary direction of the camera's forward movement (a dolly).\n*   **\"intermittently panning left with brief pauses\"**: This is a precise and nuanced observation. The camera doesn't move in one continuous motion but rather performs a series of short forward movements combined with distinct left pans, separated by brief stops.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested in the instructions while correctly omitting unnecessary details:\n*   **Included**: It covers lens distortion, camera height, camera angle, focus/depth of field, and the complex nature of the camera movement (steadiness, direction, and pattern).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly)**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video plays at a regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so there is no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus is static and deep, so there are no rack focuses or focus tracking to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and content guidelines perfectly:\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical detail into just three clear sentences without being overly verbose.\n*   **Descriptive Language**: It uses precise terminology like \"barrel distortion,\" \"level angle,\" and \"deep focus\" as instructed, and provides clear, descriptive phrases like \"bow outward\" and \"intermittently panning.\"\n*   **Movement Description**: It accurately breaks down the complex camera movement into its constituent parts (moving forward and panning) and describes its rhythm (\"intermittently... with brief pauses\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary response to the prompt. It demonstrates a keen eye for detail and a thorough understanding of the required cinematographic terminology, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and concise.",
