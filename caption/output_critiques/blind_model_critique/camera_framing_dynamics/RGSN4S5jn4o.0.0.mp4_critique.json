    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a street view, moving forward initially, then panning left to make a turn. Afterward, it continues moving forward to cross the street.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is very good. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres well to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a camera at eye level, starting with a high angle and transitioning to a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward, pans left to turn, and continues forward to cross the street. The movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical elements.\n\n*   **\"camera at eye level\"**: Correct. The perspective is consistent with that of a person of average height walking.\n*   **\"starting with a high angle and transitioning to a level angle\"**: Perfectly accurate. The video begins with the camera pointed down at the crosswalk (a high angle relative to the ground) and then tilts up to a forward-facing, level angle as the person crosses the street.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. There is no shallow depth of field; elements in the foreground, midground, and background are all reasonably sharp and in focus.\n*   **\"moves forward, pans left to turn, and continues forward\"**: This is an accurate and clear description of the camera's path. It correctly identifies the forward motion and the rotational pan to navigate the turn.\n*   **\"unsteady with noticeable shaking\"**: Correct. The movement is characteristic of a handheld or body-mounted camera without stabilization, resulting in significant shaking.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Good\n\nThe caption successfully covers the most important and noticeable aspects required by the instructions while correctly omitting standard or absent features.\n\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes camera height, angle (and its change), focus/depth of field, movement types (translation and rotation), and steadiness.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so its omission is correct per the instructions.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible lens distortion, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is not intentionally tilted, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\nThe only minor detail that could be added for even greater completeness would be to explicitly name the **tilt up** movement that causes the angle to change from high to level. However, describing the *result* (\"transitioning to a level angle\") is an effective and concise alternative.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\n\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of accurate technical information into just four sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** It correctly avoids mentioning normal video speed, the absence of distortion, or the lack of a Dutch angle, just as the instructions specified.\n*   **Describes Movement Sequentially:** It clearly outlines the camera's movements in the order they occur: \"moves forward, pans left..., and continues forward.\"\n*   **Specifies Key Attributes:** It covers all the relevant points from the instructions: height, angle, movement, steadiness, and focus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of how to apply the given instructions. It is precise, concise, and captures the essential technical and stylistic nature of the shot. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the required terminology and the rule-based system for inclusion and omission.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a camera at eye level, initially positioned at a high angle before tilting up to a level angle. It features deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing sharp details across the scene. The camera moves forward, pans left to navigate a turn, and continues forward to cross the street, with noticeable shaking indicative of handheld or body-mounted operation.",
