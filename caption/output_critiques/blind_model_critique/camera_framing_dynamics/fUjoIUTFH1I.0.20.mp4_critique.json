    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **not good**. While it correctly identifies the camera's height and angle, it contains two major factual inaccuracies regarding the depth of field and camera steadiness, which fundamentally misrepresent the visual characteristics of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **\"shot at eye level with a level camera angle\"**: This is **accurate**. The camera is positioned at the same height as the subject's head and is not tilted up or down, resulting in a straight, level perspective.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **\"...maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field.\"**: This is **inaccurate**. The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**. The subject in the midground is sharp and in focus, but the background (the window, blinds, and wall) is noticeably soft and blurred. Deep focus would mean that both the subject and the background are in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"...the camera is fixed but slightly unsteady...\"**: This is **inaccurate**. The camera is perfectly **steady and static**. There is no visible shake, wobble, or jitter, which strongly suggests it was mounted on a tripod or another stable surface. The claim of it being \"unsteady\" is incorrect.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption attempts to cover the required elements: camera height, angle, movement (or lack thereof), and focus.\n*   It correctly follows the instruction to omit details about standard video speed and the absence of lens distortion, which is good.\n*   However, because its descriptions of focus and steadiness are wrong, it fails to provide a complete and truthful picture of the shot's configuration. It misses the key visual characteristic of a shallow depth of field, which is a deliberate creative choice.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is reasonably concise. However, the phrase \"fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\" is somewhat redundant. A more standard and concise way to describe a fixed, steady shot is simply \"The shot is static\" or \"The camera is static.\"\n*   **Informativeness:** The caption fails to be informative because its key details are incorrect. The purpose of the description is to accurately convey the technical and stylistic aspects of the shot, and this caption misleads the viewer.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that accurately and concisely follows the provided instructions:\n\n**\"This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. It features a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground subject in focus while the background remains blurred.\"**",
