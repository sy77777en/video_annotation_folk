    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving right to left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good foundation, it lacks the specificity needed to fully capture the nuances of the shot. The description of the perspective as \"high, aerial\" is vague; a more precise term like \"high angle\" would clarify that the camera is angled downwards towards the horizon, capturing a vast coastal landscape, rather than pointing straight down in a \"bird's-eye view.\" The movement, described simply as \"right to left,\" is likely a more complex combination of a \"trucking left\" motion (the drone flying parallel to the shore) and a subtle \"pan left\" rotation, which allows the frame to smoothly transition its focus from a lighthouse on a cliff to the bay and town that are revealed. The purpose of this combined movement is a scenic reveal, a key detail that is currently missing. Furthermore, the caption omits any mention of the subtle barrel distortion from the wide-angle drone lens, which causes a slight, graceful curve in the horizon line. Finally, confirming that the video is playing at normal speed would be beneficial, as the smooth motion and crashing waves could easily be mistaken for slight slow-motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high angle, the camera captures a vast coastal landscape, angled downwards towards the horizon. The shot features a complex movement, combining a trucking left motion as the drone flies parallel to the shore with a subtle pan left rotation. This allows the frame to smoothly transition its focus from a lighthouse on a cliff to the bay and town that are revealed, creating a scenic reveal. The deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, while the wide-angle drone lens introduces a subtle barrel distortion, adding a graceful curve to the horizon line. The video plays at normal speed, enhancing the natural flow of the smooth motion and crashing waves.",
