    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire coastal scene, from the waves in the foreground to the distant sea stacks, sharp and clear.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"Static\"**: Correct. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way.\n    *   **\"Eye-level shot with a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned at a height and angle that mimics a person standing on the shore and looking straight out at the horizon. The horizon is not tilted.\n    *   **\"Deep focus\"**: Correct. All elements, from the rocks and waves in the immediate foreground to the sea stacks in the midground and background, are in sharp focus. The caption's elaboration—\"keeping the entire coastal scene... sharp and clear\"—is a perfect, informative description of this effect.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is brief and to the point. It correctly follows the instruction to omit details for default settings. It does not mention video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (which is absent), or Dutch angle (which is absent).\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** It successfully covers all the relevant aspects for this specific video:\n        *   **Movement:** Correctly identified as \"static.\"\n        *   **Height & Angle:** Correctly identified as \"eye-level\" and \"level angle.\"\n        *   **Focus:** Correctly identified as \"deep focus\" and provides excellent context for what is in focus.\n    *   **Terminology:** The caption uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions (e.g., \"static,\" \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the instructions. It accurately identifies the key cinematographic features of the video and describes them using the correct vocabulary, all while maintaining the requested conciseness by omitting unnecessary information.",
