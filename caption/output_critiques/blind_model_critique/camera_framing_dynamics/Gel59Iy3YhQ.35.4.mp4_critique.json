    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The camera remains completely static throughout the video.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **inaccurate and incomplete** because it fails to adhere to the full scope of the instructions, even for a simple static shot.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The accuracy of the statement \"the camera remains completely static\" can only be confirmed by viewing the video. Assuming the video does indeed feature a completely stationary camera with no pans, tilts, shakes, or zooms, then this part of the caption is factually correct. However, it is presented as a complete description, which is not accurate according to the instructions.\n\n**2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to provide a comprehensive description as required. The instruction \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static\" is a directive for describing the *movement* aspect of the shot, not a replacement for the entire description.\n\nThe caption is missing the following required information:\n*   **Camera Angle:** It does not specify if the shot is from a low angle, high angle, level angle, etc.\n*   **Camera Height:** It omits the height, such as eye-level, ground-level, or overhead.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** There is no information on whether the focus is deep (everything is sharp) or shallow (background/foreground is blurred), where the focus plane is, or if there are any focus changes.\n*   **Video Speed:** While you don't need to mention it if it's regular speed, a complete description would implicitly confirm this by its absence. The current caption is too sparse to make that assumption.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** It does not mention if there is any visible distortion (e.g., barrel or fisheye).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption correctly identifies one aspect of the shot (its static nature) but mistakenly treats it as the only necessary detail. The instructions require a **concise yet informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration as a whole.** The provided caption is concise but not informative enough.\n\n### Example of a Good Caption (for a hypothetical static video)\n\nTo illustrate what a complete and compliant caption would look like for a static shot, consider this example:\n\n\"**This is a static, eye-level shot filmed from a level angle. The focus is deep, keeping both the foreground and background elements sharp throughout the video.**\"\n\nThis improved version:\n*   States the camera is **static**.\n*   Describes the **camera height** (eye-level).\n*   Describes the **camera angle** (level angle).\n*   Describes the **focus** (deep) and **depth of field** (all elements sharp).\n*   Remains concise while covering all the necessary static attributes of the camera's configuration.",
