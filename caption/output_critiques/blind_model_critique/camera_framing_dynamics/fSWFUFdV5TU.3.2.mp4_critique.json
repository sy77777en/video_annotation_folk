    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good and largely successful in its goal. It is accurate, concise, and uses the correct terminology as specified in the instructions. It effectively captures the most prominent visual characteristics of the shot. However, it could be slightly more complete by including one more specified detail.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. Every statement made correctly describes the video:\n*   **\"low-angle shot\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned below the subject, looking up, which makes the subject appear more imposing.\n*   **\"fixed Dutch angle\"**: Correct. The horizon is clearly tilted throughout the entire shot, and the degree of tilt does not change.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground\"**: Correct. The subject in the foreground is sharp and in focus, while the building in the background is distinctly blurred.\n*   **\"smoothly zooms in\"**: Correct. The framing tightens on the subject in a smooth, continuous motion consistent with a camera zoom.\n*   **\"minimal shaking\"**: Correct. The shot is extremely steady, with no noticeable camera shake or wobble.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Good\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses one key descriptor from the instructions.\n*   **What it covers well:** It successfully identifies and describes the camera angle, Dutch angle, depth of field, focus plane, and camera movement (type, speed, and steadiness).\n*   **What it correctly omits:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is regular), **lens distortion** (as there is none), and **focus changes** (as the focus is static).\n*   **What's missing:** The caption does not specify the **camera height**. The instructions list options like *ground-level, hip-level, eye-level*, etc. In this video, the camera is placed very low, making **\"ground-level\"** the most accurate description. Adding this would make the description more comprehensive.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\n\nThe caption adheres very well to the spirit and letter of the instructions.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into a single, easy-to-read sentence.\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology:** It correctly employs terms like \"low-angle,\" \"Dutch angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"zooms in.\"\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** It demonstrates an understanding of the instructions by not mentioning standard or absent features (like regular speed or no distortion), which keeps the description focused and efficient.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo make the caption perfect according to the provided instructions, you could integrate the missing detail about camera height.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\n> Shot from a **ground-level, low angle** with a fixed Dutch angle, the camera smoothly zooms in on the foreground subject. The shot uses a shallow depth of field and remains very steady.\n\nThis revised version is slightly longer but fully complete according to all the parameters requested in your detailed instructions.",
