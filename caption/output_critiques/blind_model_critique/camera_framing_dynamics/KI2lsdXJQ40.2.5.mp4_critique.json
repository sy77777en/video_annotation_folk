    "pre_caption": "This stop-motion video is captured from a smooth, eye-level, level-angle camera. The shot employs a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the man and woman in the foreground. The camera then performs a rack focus, shifting the focus plane to the people in the midground. Concurrently, the camera trucks to the right, gradually slowing to a stop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera starts focused on the foreground, and later becomes focused on the midground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera trucks to the right, gradually slowing down until it comes to a complete stop before the video ends.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written and accurate caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Flawless**\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the video as **stop-motion**, which is evident from the incremental, frame-by-frame movement of the people and objects.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** The description of a **\"smooth, eye-level, level-angle camera\"** is spot-on. The camera is positioned at the subjects' eye level, it isn't tilted up or down, and the movement itself is smooth rather than shaky.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The analysis of the focus is perfect.\n    *   It correctly identifies the **\"shallow depth of field\"** (blurry background).\n    *   It accurately states the initial focus is on the **\"man and woman in the foreground.\"**\n    *   It correctly uses the term **\"rack focus\"** to describe the shift and accurately notes that the new focus plane is the **\"people in the midground.\"**\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is precise.\n    *   It correctly identifies the movement as **\"trucks to the right.\"**\n    *   It accurately observes that the movement happens **\"concurrently\"** with the rack focus.\n    *   It correctly notes the change in speed: **\"gradually slowing to a stop.\"**\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant details required by the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **Included:** Video speed, camera angle, camera height, movement type (trucking), movement speed and complexity (slowing to a stop), steadiness (smooth), and focus dynamics (shallow DoF, rack focus, focus plane shift).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):** The caption correctly follows the instruction to omit details that are not present. There is no lens distortion or Dutch angle, so they are not mentioned, which contributes to the caption's conciseness.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption packs a significant amount of technical information into just four clear sentences without any wasted words.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It demonstrates a masterful use of the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions, such as `stop-motion`, `eye-level`, `level-angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `rack focus`, `focus plane`, and `trucks`.\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description follows a logical flow, establishing the initial setup first and then describing the dynamic changes (the concurrent focus pull and camera movement) as they happen.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate in every detail, complete in its coverage of the video's key technical aspects, and perfectly structured using the precise terminology required. There are no improvements to suggest; it is an ideal description for this video based on the criteria provided.",
