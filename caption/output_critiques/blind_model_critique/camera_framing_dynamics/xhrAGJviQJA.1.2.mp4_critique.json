    "pre_caption": "This bird's-eye view shot is captured from a camera mounted on a rocket. The camera starts at an overhead level, looking directly down at the launch site. As the rocket launches, the camera moves smoothly straight up, ascending to an aerial level. A deep depth of field keeps the ground below in sharp focus throughout the ascent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an overhead level (around second floor height) and then moves to an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera angle and movement, it lacks the specific, dynamic details one would expect from a rocket-mounted camera. The description of the movement as \"smoothly straight up\" is a significant oversight; the initial launch would undoubtedly involve severe, high-frequency vibrations and shaking that would likely lessen as the rocket clears the densest part of the atmosphere. A more accurate caption would note this initial instability. The description also omits any rotational movement; it's highly probable the rocket would perform a slow, continuous *roll* for stabilization, causing the entire frame to rotate steadily as it ascends. Furthermore, a camera used for this purpose would almost certainly have a wide-angle lens, creating prominent *barrel* or *fisheye distortion* that would make the ground appear to curve away, a crucial visual characteristic that is not mentioned. Lastly, while the depth of field is deep, the caption could be improved by noting how atmospheric haze progressively softens the details on the ground and how the curvature of the Earth becomes increasingly apparent as the rocket reaches its peak altitude within the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This dynamic bird's-eye view shot is captured from a camera mounted on a rocket, equipped with a wide-angle lens that creates a distinctive fisheye distortion, making the ground appear to curve away. The camera begins at an overhead level, looking directly down at the launch site. As the rocket launches, the camera experiences intense vibrations and shaking, characteristic of the initial ascent through the densest part of the atmosphere. As the rocket climbs higher, these vibrations lessen, and a slow, continuous roll for stabilization causes the frame to rotate steadily. The deep depth of field keeps the ground in focus, but atmospheric haze gradually softens the details, and the curvature of the Earth becomes increasingly visible as the rocket reaches its peak altitude.",
