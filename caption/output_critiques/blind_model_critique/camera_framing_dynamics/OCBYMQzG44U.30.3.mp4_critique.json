    "pre_caption": "This video is filmed from a camera positioned at a level angle just above the water, housed inside a transparent, ball-shaped cover. Water droplets on the cover obscure the view, making the focus indistinct, and the lens exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera performs a smooth and quick pan to the right, pausing briefly before resuming its motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows a camera inside a ball-shaped transparent cover, floating on the water. Water droplets trickle down the outside of the cover, blurring the view and making it difficult to determine the type of camera focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera quickly pans right, briefly pauses, and then resumes panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the camera's low, level angle, the water droplets, and the mild barrel distortion, it misses several critical details that define the shot's character and mood. The term \"indistinct focus\" is too vague; the video actually utilizes an ultra-shallow depth of field, with the focus plane deliberately set on the water droplets on the transparent cover, rendering the background (a rocky shoreline) into a soft, abstract blur. The caption also completely omits the most persistent camera movement: a gentle, continuous pedestaling motion as the camera bobs up and down with the rhythm of the small waves, which is a defining characteristic of being at water level. Furthermore, the video is presented in subtle slow-motion, which accentuates the graceful bobbing and the dreamlike way the water laps against the lens. A more accurate description would specify that the focus is locked on the foreground droplets, mention the constant vertical bobbing in addition to the horizontal pan, and note the use of slow-motion, which together create a serene and immersive viewing experience.",
