    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect example of how to follow the instructions precisely. It is accurate, concise, and informative.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Level Camera Angle:** Correct. The camera is positioned on the same horizontal plane as the subject (the dog).\n*   **Extremely Shallow Depth of Field:** Correct. The background is completely blurred into an abstract wash of color (bokeh), indicating a very wide aperture and/or a long focal length, resulting in an extremely shallow depth of field.\n*   **Focusing on the Foreground:** Correct. The dog, which occupies the foreground, is the sole point of sharp focus.\n*   **Fixed but Slightly Unsteady:** Correct. This is a nuanced and accurate description. The camera does not pan, tilt, or dolly (\"fixed\"), but the subtle micro-jitters indicate it is likely handheld rather than on a tripod (\"slightly unsteady\").\n\n**2. Completeness (Adherence to Instructions):**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption masterfully adheres to the instruction to be concise by omitting default characteristics. It does not mention:\n    *   **Video Speed:** Because it's at a regular, real-time speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** Because there is none.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** Because the horizon is level.\n    *   **Camera Height:** Because \"level angle\" sufficiently describes the camera's vertical position relative to the subject.\n*   **Required Elements:** The caption successfully identifies and describes all the key non-standard configurations present in the video:\n    *   **Focus & Depth:** It correctly identifies the \"extremely shallow depth of field\" and the \"foreground\" focus plane.\n    *   **Movement & Steadiness:** It correctly describes the camera as \"fixed\" (static) while also noting its \"slightly unsteady\" nature.\n    *   **Angle:** It correctly specifies the \"level camera angle.\"\n\n**3. Overall Quality:**\nThe caption is excellent because it avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"fixed\" instead of \"static\") and combines related concepts into a smooth, readable sentence. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography principles and the ability to apply them descriptively and concisely, exactly as the instructions demanded.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a level camera angle with an extremely shallow depth of field, sharply focusing on the foreground subject, a dog. The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness, likely due to handheld operation, with no intentional movement.",
