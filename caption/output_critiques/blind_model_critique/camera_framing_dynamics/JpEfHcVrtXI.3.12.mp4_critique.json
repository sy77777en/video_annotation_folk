    "pre_caption": "This video features a smooth camera that tracks a small, glowing yellow character from the side as it moves to the right. The camera tilts up and down to follow the character's motion, shifting from a level to a high-angle perspective. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire dark, atmospheric room in sharp detail.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera follows the lightning avatar to the right, tilting up and down to follow its motion, and concludes with further movement to the right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera action of tracking a character and the use of deep focus, it lacks specificity and misses several key details. The description of the movement as \"tilts up and down\" is vague; in the video, the camera performs a single, continuous upward tilt combined with a pedestal up, smoothly following the character as it floats from the floor onto a high bookshelf, which is what causes the shift from a level to a high-angle perspective. The side-tracking could be more precisely termed \"trucking right.\" The caption also omits the initial camera height, which is at hip-level before it begins its ascent. Furthermore, while the focus is deep, the glowing character produces a noticeable bloom effect and soft lens flare that contrasts with the sharp detail of the room, an important visual element that is not mentioned. Finally, the caption should confirm that the video is presented in real-time and note the absence of any lens distortion to provide a more complete technical summary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a smooth camera movement that trucks right, tracking a small, glowing yellow character. Initially positioned at hip-level, the camera performs a continuous upward tilt combined with a pedestal up, seamlessly following the character as it floats from the floor onto a high bookshelf. This movement transitions the perspective from level to high-angle. The deep focus keeps the entire dark, atmospheric room in sharp detail, while the glowing character creates a noticeable bloom effect and soft lens flare, contrasting with the room's clarity. The video is presented in real-time, with no lens distortion, providing a complete and immersive visual experience.",
