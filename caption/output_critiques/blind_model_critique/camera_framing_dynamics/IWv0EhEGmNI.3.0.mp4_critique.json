    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** A first-person game camera intermittently pans right and zooms in to aim at some enemies.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent starting point but contains significant inaccuracies and omissions that fail to capture the key dynamic elements of the video, particularly regarding movement and focus. It oversimplifies the camera work and misrepresents the visual characteristics of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption has several inaccuracies:\n\n*   **\"smooth\"**: This is incorrect. The camera movement is from a first-person perspective simulating walking, which includes a naturalistic sway or \"head-bob.\" It is not smooth in the way a dolly or gimbal shot would be. The instruction asks to describe steadiness, and \"smooth\" is a misleading descriptor here.\n*   **\"maintains a level angle\"**: This is partially inaccurate. While the camera is often at a level angle, it frequently **tilts up and down** to aim at enemies at different elevations and to look around the environment. Ignoring the tilt misses a primary component of the camera's rotation.\n*   **\"a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: This is the most significant error. The video features a **dynamic depth of field**. While the focus is deep when the player is not aiming, the moment the camera zooms in to aim down the sights, the depth of field becomes **shallow**. The target is kept in sharp focus, while the weapon in the foreground and the distant background become noticeably blurred. The caption completely misses this crucial and intentional visual effect.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and omits several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Movement (Translation)**: The caption only mentions rotation (panning) and zooming. It completely fails to describe the camera's translational movements as the character walks through the environment:\n    *   **Dollying:** The camera constantly moves forward (dollying in) as the character advances.\n    *   **Trucking:** The camera moves left and right (trucking) as the character strafes.\n*   **Camera Movement (Rotation)**: As mentioned, the caption omits the **tilting** motion. It also understates the panning by describing it as \"intermittently to the right,\" when in fact the camera pans frequently in both directions.\n*   **Focus Changes**: The instructions explicitly ask to describe dynamic focus changes. The caption fails to mention the shift from deep focus to shallow depth of field that occurs during the zoom, which is a key stylistic element of the video.\n*   **Steadiness**: The caption uses the inaccurate term \"smooth\" but doesn't describe the actual steadiness, which could be better characterized as \"moderately steady with a naturalistic sway.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the core requirements of the instructions:\n\n*   It does not provide an informative description of the camera's **movements**, missing translation (dollying, trucking), rotation (tilting), and steadiness.\n*   It fails to describe the **focus changes** and the variable **depth of field**, which is a specific point in the instructions.\n*   While it aims for conciseness, it does so by sacrificing essential information, failing the \"concise **yet informative**\" directive.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**From a first-person perspective at eye-level, the camera moves with a naturalistic sway, combining forward dollying and side-to-side trucking to navigate the environment. It frequently pans and tilts to scan the area. When aiming at enemies, the camera executes a quick zoom-in, which simultaneously shifts the focus to a shallow depth of field, blurring the foreground and background while keeping the target sharp. When not aiming, the scene maintains a deep focus.**",
