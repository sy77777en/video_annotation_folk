    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is **not good** because it contains significant inaccuracies and imprecise language. While it correctly identifies some aspects of the shot, it fails on the most prominent visual characteristics, particularly the focus and camera steadiness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's accuracy and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"shot at eye level with a level camera angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is positioned at the seated subject's eye level and is not tilted up or down.\n*   **\"maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field\"**: **Incorrect.** This is the most significant error. The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**. The subject in the midground is in sharp focus, but the background (the room, window, and shelves) is distinctly blurred. Deep focus would mean both the subject and the background are sharp.\n*   **\"The camera remains fixed but slightly unsteady\"**: **Imprecise and Misleading.** The term \"fixed\" implies the camera is mounted on a tripod or a stable surface. The \"slight unsteadiness\" is a clear indicator of a **handheld** shot. A more accurate description would be \"The camera is handheld and mostly static, with slight unsteadiness.\"\n*   **\"focusing on the person in the foreground\"**: **Slightly Inaccurate.** The person is the main subject, but they occupy the **midground** of the frame's depth, not the absolute foreground.\n\n**2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details about video speed and lens distortion, as neither is present.\n*   However, its failure to accurately describe the depth of field and camera steadiness means it does not provide an informative description as required by the core instruction.\n\n### Corrected Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately describes the video according to the provided instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a static, handheld position at eye-level with a level angle, the video exhibits slight unsteadiness. A shallow depth of field is used to keep the person in the midground in sharp focus while blurring the background.\"**",
