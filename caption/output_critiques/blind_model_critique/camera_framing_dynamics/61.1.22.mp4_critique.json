    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is good and captures several key aspects of the video, but it misses one crucial detail and could be slightly more precise in its terminology.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on your instructions:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a low-angle shot at eye level, focusing on a man in the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera moves backward, leading the man from the front, and exhibits noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady movement.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\nThe information presented in the caption is entirely correct.\n*   **\"low-angle shot at eye level\"**: Accurate. The camera is held around a person's chest/shoulder height (eye-level) but is tilted slightly upward at the subject, creating a low angle.\n*   **\"focusing on a man in the foreground with a shallow depth of field\"**: Accurate. The man is the primary subject and is in sharp focus, while the background is clearly and intentionally blurred.\n*   **\"camera moves backward, leading the man from the front\"**: Accurate. This correctly describes the direction and purpose of the camera's movement relative to the subject.\n*   **\"exhibits noticeable shaking, indicating unsteady movement\"**: Accurate. The shot is clearly handheld and not stabilized, resulting in a natural, shaky motion.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Good but Incomplete\nThe caption successfully identifies the most obvious features but misses a key dynamic element mentioned in the instructions.\n*   **What's Missing:** The most significant omission is the description of the **focus change**. The instructions state: *\"If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a... focus tracking (following a subject’s depth movement).\"* In this video, as the camera and subject move, the focus plane is actively adjusted to keep the man sharp. This is a clear example of **focus tracking**, which is a critical part of the camera's configuration and is not mentioned.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Good\nThe caption adheres well to most of the rules but fails on one specific point.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is **concise**.\n    *   It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., regular video speed, no lens distortion, no Dutch angle).\n    *   It correctly identifies angle, height, depth of field, and movement.\n*   **Weakness:**\n    *   It fails to follow the specific instruction to describe dynamic focus changes, such as **focus tracking**. While it mentions *what* is in focus, it doesn't describe *how* the focus behaves throughout the shot.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong, accurate summary for a general audience. However, according to the detailed technical instructions provided, it is incomplete because it fails to describe the active **focus tracking**, which is a key technical choice in executing this shot.\n\n### Example of an Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that fully adheres to the instructions by incorporating the missing element:\n\n\"The video is captured from a **low angle** at **eye-level** with a **shallow depth of field**. The unsteady, handheld camera **tracks backward** to lead the man in the foreground. The focus **actively tracks the subject**, keeping him sharp against the blurred background as the distance between them changes.\"",
