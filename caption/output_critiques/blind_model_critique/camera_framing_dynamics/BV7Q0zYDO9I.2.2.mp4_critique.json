    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward, moving down, panning right, and moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, the provided caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, comprehensive yet concise, and perfectly adheres to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nEvery technical detail mentioned in the caption is a correct observation of the video:\n\n*   **\"From a high, overhead angle...\"**: The shot begins from a very high, near bird's-eye perspective and maintains a high angle throughout.\n*   **\"...the scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all the figures sharp.\"**: This is correct. Both the figures closer to the camera and those in the background remain in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"...smooth, complex movement...\"**: The camera move is perfectly steady (smooth) and involves multiple axes of motion simultaneously (complex).\n*   **\"...simultaneously moving forward, down, and left while panning to the right...\"**: This is a precise and technically accurate breakdown of the camera's motion.\n    *   It moves **forward** (dollying in) toward the center of the group.\n    *   It moves **down** (pedestaling/craning down) from its initial high position.\n    *   It moves **left** (trucking left) across the scene.\n    *   It rotates **right** (panning right) to keep the central group in frame as the camera trucks left.\n*   **\"...creating a slow, descending arc over the assembly.\"**: This is a brilliant and concise summary of the overall effect of the complex movement. The speed is indeed slow and deliberate, and the path feels like a descending arc.\n\n### 2. Completeness & Conciseness\n\nThe caption masterfully balances providing all necessary information without including superfluous details, exactly as the instructions requested.\n\n*   **What it includes:** It correctly identifies and describes the most prominent features of the shot: **camera angle/height**, **focus**, and the intricate **camera movement** (including its components, speed, steadiness, and overall path).\n*   **What it correctly omits:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The camera is not tilted, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there was no need to mention transitions.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines perfectly.\n\n*   It provides a **\"concise yet informative description\"** of the camera's configuration and movement.\n*   It uses precise terminology like **\"deep focus\"** and **\"panning\"** while also describing translational movements (\"moving forward, down, and left\").\n*   It accurately describes the **camera angle** (\"high, overhead\") and the nature of the **movement** (\"smooth, complex,\" \"slow, descending arc\").\n*   It successfully synthesizes multiple simultaneous movements into a clear and understandable description.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, well-written, and demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography principles. There are no corrections or improvements to suggest; it is an ideal description for this video based on the criteria provided.",
