    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **good but not great**. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, such as the initial angle, the shallow depth of field, and the unsteady movement. However, it lacks precision in its terminology and misses some details required by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly states that the video begins with a high-angle view, has a shallow depth of field on the foreground horse, and features unsteady camera movement.\n*   **Inaccuracy/Imprecision:**\n    *   `\"...looking down at the horses.\"` The initial focus is on a single horse in the foreground. The second horse is out of focus in the background. The plural \"horses\" is slightly misleading for the initial framing.\n    *   `\"The camera is at eye level and transitions to a level angle...\"` This phrasing is confusing because it mixes **camera height** (`eye level`) with **camera angle** (`level angle`). While the camera is likely held at the operator's eye level, the key action is the *angle* changing relative to the subject. A more precise description would separate these two elements.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key descriptive elements required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description `\"moving without a clear pattern\"` is a good summary, but it could be more specific. The instructions ask for types of movement like dollying, trucking, etc. The camera performs a slight **dolly out** (pulls back) and moves erratically side-to-side.\n*   **Focus:** While it correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and foreground focus plane, it doesn't mention that the **focus is fixed**. The instructions ask to note dynamic focus changes like *rack focus* or *focus tracking*; since there are none, stating the focus is fixed would make the description more complete.\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption mentions \"eye level\" but mixes it with the angle description. It should be stated clearly as the camera's height relative to the ground.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which is good.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses some correct terms (`high-angle`, `level angle`, `shallow depth of field`). However, as noted, it conflates height and angle terminology, which goes against the instruction to describe them as separate configurations.\n*   **Structure:** It follows a logical flow but doesn't cover all the required points in the specified detail (e.g., specific movement types, fixed focus).\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a constant eye-level height, the video begins with a high-angle view of a horse's head before shifting to a level angle. The camera maintains a fixed focus on the foreground horse, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The handheld camera is very unsteady, moving erratically with slight backward and side-to-side motions throughout the single, continuous shot.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n1.  **Separates Height and Angle:** It clearly states the height is a constant `eye-level` and the `angle` is what `shifts` from high to level.\n2.  **Specifies Focus:** It clarifies that the focus is `fixed` on the foreground subject.\n3.  **Details Movement:** It improves upon \"moving without a clear pattern\" by specifying the types of erratic movement (`slight backward and side-to-side motions`).\n4.  **Adds Shot Information:** It notes that it is a `single, continuous shot`, which is a useful detail when no transitions are present.",
