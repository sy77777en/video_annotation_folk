    "pre_caption": "This eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the boy in the midground in focus.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward while slightly tilting and ascending to draw closer to the boy's face.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the core camera movements and depth of field, it could be more specific and evocative. For instance, \"eye-level\" might be imprecise; if the subject is a child, the camera likely starts at a **chest-level medium shot** before moving. The term \"ascending\" is a bit vague; a more descriptive phrase like **\"a slow pedestal up\"** or a gentle **\"crane-like arc\"** would better define the vertical motion. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the *quality* and *speed* of the movement; \"slightly unsteady\" could be refined to **\"a gentle, handheld sway,\"** and specifying that the dolly is **\"slow and deliberate\"** would add crucial information about the shot's pacing and mood. Furthermore, the description of focus could be more dynamic. Instead of just stating the boy is kept in focus, the caption could note a subtle **focus pull** that shifts from the boy's hands to his eyes as he looks up, which would be a common technique to draw the viewer's attention in such a shot. Finally, the shallow depth of field likely becomes more pronounced as the camera moves closer, transitioning to an **ultra-shallow depth of field** in the final close-up, isolating the boy's facial expression with greater intensity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with a chest-level medium view of the boy, utilizing a shallow depth of field to keep him in focus. The camera executes a slow and deliberate forward dolly, accompanied by a gentle, handheld sway. As it moves, the camera performs a slow pedestal up, transitioning from a level to a low angle. The focus subtly shifts from the boy's hands to his eyes as he looks up, drawing the viewer's attention. As the camera closes in, the depth of field becomes ultra-shallow, isolating the boy's facial expression with greater intensity.",
