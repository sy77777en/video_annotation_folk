    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a handheld camera at eye level, initially static and capturing a display board from a high angle. It then pans left while tilting up to a level view, focusing on the street scene. The camera exhibits slight shakiness throughout, maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera initially remains static, facing a display board from a high angle. It then gradually pans left while tilting up to a level view, accompanied by subtle movements.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is very good and captures the key elements of the video accurately. However, it can be refined for greater precision and to more fully align with the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Very High**\n\n*   **\"handheld camera at eye level\"**: Correct. The slight shakiness indicates it's handheld, and the perspective is consistent with a person of average height holding a camera.\n*   **\"initially static\"**: This is slightly inaccurate. The camera is never perfectly static; there is a constant, subtle wobble characteristic of being handheld. A better term would be \"briefly held\" or \"largely static.\"\n*   **\"capturing a display board from a high angle\"**: Correct. The camera is pointed downward at the board.\n*   **\"pans left while tilting up to a level view\"**: Correct. The movement is a simultaneous pan and tilt. However, the instruction uses the term \"level angle,\" which is more precise than \"level view.\"\n*   **\"slight shakiness throughout\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the camera's stability.\n*   **\"maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. Everything from the foreground to the background is in focus. The phrasing is slightly redundant, as \"deep focus\" implies a \"large depth of field,\" but it's not incorrect.\n\n**2. Completeness: Good**\n\nThe caption successfully covers many of the required points: camera height, angle, movement, steadiness, and focus. However, it misses a few details requested in the instructions:\n\n*   **Movement Purpose:** The instruction asks for the purpose of the movement. Here, the purpose is clearly to shift the viewer's attention from the indoor display to the outdoor street scene.\n*   **Movement Speed:** The speed of the pan and tilt is not mentioned (e.g., slow, moderate, fast).\n*   **Focus Plane:** While \"deep focus\" is mentioned, the instruction also asks to specify the focus plane. The caption could be more explicit that focus is maintained from the foreground to the background.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Very Good**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and effective.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** You correctly omitted mentions of normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, as per the instructions.\n*   **Terminology:** The use of \"pan,\" \"tilt,\" \"high angle,\" and \"deep focus\" is excellent. The only minor deviation is using \"level view\" instead of the more technical \"level angle.\"\n*   **Temporal Order:** The description of the movement (\"first... then...\") follows the events in the video correctly.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback to be more accurate and complete according to the instructions:\n\n**\"A handheld, slightly shaky shot from eye level begins with a high angle on a display board. The camera then pans left and tilts up at a moderate speed to reveal the street scene, settling on a level angle. The shot maintains deep focus throughout, keeping elements from the foreground to the background sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this version is an improvement:**\n\n*   **More Accurate Start:** It avoids the term \"static\" and instead describes the continuous state of the camera (\"handheld, slightly shaky shot\").\n*   **Specifies Movement Details:** It adds the movement's speed (\"moderate speed\") and purpose (\"to reveal the street scene\").\n*   **Uses Precise Terminology:** It uses \"level angle\" for consistency with \"high angle.\"\n*   **Clarifies Focus:** It explicitly states that focus is sharp \"from the foreground to the background,\" which is a more complete description of the deep focus.",
