    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera sweeps counterclockwise in an arc around the basketball player, dynamically capturing his repeated dunks.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a solid foundation, it may oversimplify the dynamic nature of the shot and omits key details. The description of movement as a simple \"counterclockwise arc\" is likely incomplete; the camera probably also *tracks* the player's forward momentum toward the hoop and *tilts up* dramatically to follow his ascent, before tilting back down. The \"eye-level\" perspective might only apply to the start of the shot, as the operator likely drops to a *low angle* during the jump to enhance the player's height and the dunk's impact. A crucial missing element is video speed; it's highly probable that the video uses *slow-motion* during the peak of each dunk to emphasize the athleticism, potentially employing *speed ramps* to transition from the real-time run-up. Furthermore, the claim of \"deep focus\" is questionable for a handheld, moving shot. It is more likely that the video uses a *shallow depth of field* with continuous *focus tracking* to keep the player locked in sharp focus while the background mural is artistically blurred, better isolating the subject. Lastly, \"repeated dunks\" suggests editing, so the caption should specify if the video uses *hard cuts* between different dunk attempts rather than implying it's all one continuous take.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with an unsteady, handheld perspective that initially captures the basketball player at eye level. As the player moves toward the hoop, the camera dynamically tracks his forward momentum, sweeping in a counterclockwise arc while also tilting up dramatically to follow his ascent. During the jump, the operator shifts to a low angle to enhance the player's height and the impact of the dunk. The video employs slow-motion at the peak of each dunk to emphasize athleticism, using speed ramps to transition from the real-time run-up. Rather than maintaining deep focus, the shot uses a shallow depth of field with continuous focus tracking to keep the player sharply in focus while artistically blurring the background mural, isolating the subject. The video features repeated dunks, likely using hard cuts between different attempts, rather than presenting a single continuous take.",
