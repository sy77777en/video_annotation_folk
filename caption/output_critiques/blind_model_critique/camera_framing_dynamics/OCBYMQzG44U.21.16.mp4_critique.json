    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This is a first-person POV shot where the camera moves forward with multiple slight pans to the left while descending the arcing stairs.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written and detailed analysis. The caption is very good, but your feedback will help refine it to be even more precise and fully compliant with the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is concise, informative, and accurately captures most of the key visual and technical elements of the video. It successfully uses the specified terminology and follows the spirit of the instructions. The areas for improvement are minor and relate to precision and strict adherence to the distinction between certain terms.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, first-person POV shot\"**: **Highly Accurate.** The camera has a natural bobbing motion consistent with walking, and the perspective is clearly from the operator's point of view.\n*   **\"from a high, eye-level angle\"**: **Partially Inaccurate / Confusing.** This is the main point of weakness. The instruction asks to distinguish between **height** and **angle**.\n    *   The **height** is **eye-level** (relative to the person holding the camera).\n    *   The **angle** is a **high angle** (because the camera is tilted downward to look at the steps).\n    *   The caption conflates these two distinct concepts into one phrase. A more accurate description would separate them.\n*   **\"The camera moves forward, descending a set of arcing stairs\"**: **Highly Accurate.** This is an excellent, non-technical description of a complex movement that combines dollying forward, pedestaling down, and trucking left along a curve.\n*   **\"while making multiple slight pans to the left\"**: **Highly Accurate.** The camera does rotate horizontally to the left to follow the direction of the staircase.\n*   **\"mild barrel distortion\"**: **Highly Accurate.** The vertical railings and lines near the edges of the frame show a slight outward curve, which is characteristic of mild barrel distortion from a wide-angle lens.\n*   **\"maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: **Highly Accurate.** Both the foreground steps and the background elements on the lower floor are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete and adheres well to the instruction to omit unnecessary information.\n\n*   **Included (Correctly):** Steadiness, camera movement (translation and rotation), lens distortion, and focus are all described.\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly omitted as per the instructions.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** There is no significant tilt, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot, so there was no need to mention transitions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is compact and efficient, packing a lot of information into three sentences.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses specific terms like \"first-person POV,\" \"pans,\" \"barrel distortion,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the movement is clear and easy for a reader to visualize.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The only lack of adherence is the failure to strictly separate **camera height** from **camera angle** as defined in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Revision\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback and aligns perfectly with the instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nThis slightly unsteady, first-person POV shot is filmed from an **eye-level height with a high camera angle**. The camera moves forward and descends a set of arcing stairs, **panning slightly left** to follow the curve. The video features mild barrel distortion and maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\n\n**Why it's better:**\n*   It correctly separates \"eye-level height\" from \"high camera angle,\" making it more precise and fully compliant.\n*   It slightly simplifies \"making multiple slight pans to the left\" to \"panning slightly left,\" which is a bit more concise while retaining the same meaning.",
