    "pre_caption": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus. The camera exhibits minor, very smooth movement as it pans from right to left, following the man.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning right to left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the eye-level angle and shallow depth of field, it lacks precision and omits key details that would be apparent in the video. The movement is described as a \"pan,\" but to follow a walking man smoothly while maintaining a consistent distance and profile, the camera is more likely *trucking left* in a *tracking shot*; a pure pan from a static point would cause the man's perspective and size to change as he moves across the frame. The description of the focus plane is also likely inaccurate; the man is probably in the *midground*, not the \"foreground,\" with both the immediate foreground (e.g., the pavement he walks on) and the background (e.g., blurry city lights) being out of focus. Furthermore, the caption misses crucial context. For example, if the video is in *slow-motion* to emphasize the man's contemplative mood, this is a vital detail that defines the shot. The \"very smooth movement\" could be more technically described as \"stabilized\" or \"gimbal-like,\" and the beautiful *bokeh* effect created by the out-of-focus lights in the background is a significant visual element that goes unmentioned.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to keep the man in the midground in focus. The camera smoothly trucks left in a tracking shot, maintaining a consistent distance and profile as it follows the man. The immediate foreground, such as the pavement, and the background, featuring beautifully blurred city lights, are out of focus, creating a striking bokeh effect. The movement is stabilized, giving it a gimbal-like quality. If the video is in slow-motion, it enhances the contemplative mood of the scene, adding a crucial layer of context.",
