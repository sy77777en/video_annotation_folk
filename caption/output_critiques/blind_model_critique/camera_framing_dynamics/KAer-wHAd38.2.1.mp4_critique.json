    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the camera captures the scene with a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera appears to be mounted on a moving car, initially looking forward and slightly to the left. It then pans right to align its view with the road, continuing to move forward with the car.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a high-quality caption that accurately and comprehensively describes the video according to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n*   **Camera Position:** \"Eye-level, level-angle\" is a perfect description. The camera is positioned as if from a driver's or passenger's perspective and is not tilted up, down, or sideways.\n*   **Focus:** \"Deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp\" is correct. The foreground (road), midground (paddies), and background (trees and mountains) are all in sharp focus.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement is precise.\n    *   It correctly identifies the shot is \"mounted on a smoothly moving vehicle,\" which accounts for the steady forward motion.\n    *   It accurately notes the initial framing: \"looking forward and slightly left.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the rotational movement as a \"pans right.\"\n    *   It accurately describes the purpose and result of the pan: \"to align with the straight road ahead.\"\n    *   It correctly states the forward motion is at a \"steady pace.\"\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all relevant information while correctly omitting unnecessary details, as per the instructions.\n*   **Included:**\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** `eye-level, level-angle`\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus`\n    *   **Movements:** It describes the translation (`moving forward`), rotation (`pans right`), steadiness (`smoothly`), and speed (`steady pace`).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into three clear sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Logical Structure:** It begins with the static configuration (angle, focus) and then describes the camera's movement chronologically, which is easy to follow.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and descriptive (\"vibrant green rice paddies\"), making it easy for a reader to visualize the scene and the camera's action. It uses the correct terminology (\"pans right\") in a natural, accessible way.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to apply the detailed instructions to a video clip. It is accurate, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly structured for clarity and conciseness. No improvements are needed.",
