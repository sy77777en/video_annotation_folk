    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward, moving down, and tilting down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but could be more precise**. It correctly identifies the main characteristics of the shot (high angle, deep focus, forward/downward movement). However, it oversimplifies the camera height and could use more specific terminology to fully adhere to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"high angle, looking down from above\"**: This is accurate. The camera is clearly positioned to look down on the subject (the escalator steps and the floor below).\n    *   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: This is correct. All elements, from the foreground steps to the background floor, are sharp and in focus.\n    *   **\"smoothly moves forward and down while tilting down\"**: This accurately describes the primary camera movements. The motion is smooth (dictated by the escalator), and it involves both translation (forward/down) and rotation (tilting).\n\n*   **What's Imprecise or Partially Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"a camera at eye level\"**: This is an oversimplification. The camera *starts* at approximately eye-level on the upper floor but its height is **dynamic**, not static. The key aspect of its height is that it is **descending**. The caption presents the height as a fixed attribute rather than a changing one.\n    *   **\"looking down from above\"**: While true, this is redundant when you've already stated it's a \"high angle.\" For conciseness, one of these would suffice.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Included (Good):** The caption successfully covers the most prominent aspects: angle, focus, and the general direction of movement. It also correctly follows the instruction to omit non-existent features like lens distortion, speed changes, or Dutch angles.\n\n*   **What's Missing (Could be better):**\n    *   **Dynamic Height:** The caption fails to describe the *change* in camera height (pedestaling down from one floor to another).\n    *   **Specific Movement Terminology:** The instructions encourage using terms like *dollying*, *pedestaling*, and *tilting*. While \"moves forward and down\" is understandable, using more technical terms would show a deeper analysis. The movement is essentially a **dolly forward and pedestal down** simultaneously, guided by the escalator's track.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The instruction mentions describing steadiness. The caption implies it with the word \"smoothly,\" but it could explicitly state that the shot is very steady with minimal wobble, characteristic of being on a mechanical track.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the instruction for **conciseness** and for **omitting non-applicable details**.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes **angle, focus, and movement**, as requested.\n*   Its main failure in adherence is not fully describing the **dynamic nature of the camera's configuration**, specifically its changing height. The instructions state, \"If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions,\" which was missed.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more fully incorporates the instructions and addresses the feedback points:\n\n**\"From a high angle, the camera smoothly dollies forward and pedestals down, following the path of an escalator from an upper to a lower level. The shot begins at eye-level and tilts further downward during the descent. The entire scene is held in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **More Precise Height:** It clarifies that the camera's height is dynamic (\"from an upper to a lower level\") and specifies its starting point (\"begins at eye-level\").\n*   **Technical Terminology:** It uses more specific terms like \"dollies forward\" and \"pedestals down\" to describe the translation.\n*   **Clear Sequence:** It clearly separates the translation (\"dollies forward and pedestals down\") from the rotation (\"tilts further downward\").\n*   **Maintains Conciseness:** It remains concise while packing in more accurate detail.",
