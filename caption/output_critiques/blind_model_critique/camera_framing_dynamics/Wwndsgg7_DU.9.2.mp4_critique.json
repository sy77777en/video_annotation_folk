    "pre_caption": "The video exhibits noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level, employing a high angle view that looks down on the scene. A Dutch angle is present and varies due to camera rolling. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp. Initially static, the handheld camera then smoothly pans continuously to the left, tracking a girl as she runs across the lawn.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera stays static at first, then continuously pans left to track a girl runnning on the lawn\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning leftward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies key elements like the fisheye distortion and deep focus, it contains some contradictions and could be more precise. The description of the camera being at 'eye level' while using a 'high angle' is confusing; it would be clearer to state that the camera is held at the operator's eye level but positioned above the subject, creating a high-angle perspective on the girl below. The term 'smoothly pans' oversimplifies the movement; since the video shows a handheld camera following a running child, the motion is more likely a combination of panning and trucking left, with some minor, natural handheld shake that the word 'smoothly' overlooks. The description of the Dutch angle 'varying due to camera rolling' is vague; a more descriptive account would specify the direction and purpose of the roll, for instance, 'the camera rolls progressively counter-clockwise, increasing the tilt to enhance the sense of motion.' Finally, while 'deep focus' is accurate, it's a natural byproduct of the wide-angle lens causing the fisheye effect; mentioning that the focus keeps the foreground grass, the midground subject, and the background scenery equally sharp would provide a more complete picture of the depth of field.",
