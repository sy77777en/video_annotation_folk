    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward along the street, initially facing the front-right, and pans left to align with the direction of motion. The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, initially facing the front-right, continuously moves forward along the street while panning left to align its orientation with the direction of motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is factually correct in every aspect:\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The video is clearly shot from an **eye-level** perspective with a **level angle**, and the caption correctly identifies this.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The entire scene, from the immediate foreground to the distant background, is in sharp focus. The description of **deep focus** and a **large depth of field** is accurate.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is exceptionally precise. The camera does **move forward**, and it starts by looking slightly to the **front-right** before **panning left** to face the direction of travel.\n*   **Steadiness:** The movement has a subtle, natural shake, which is well-described as **slightly unsteady, with some shaking**.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information required by the instructions while omitting what is not present:\n*   It correctly identifies **camera height, angle, focus, depth of field, and movement**.\n*   The description of the movement is comprehensive, covering the type (translation and rotation), direction, and steadiness. It even correctly infers the purpose of the pan (\"to align with the direction of motion\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the rules of the prompt perfectly:\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise and avoids unnecessary words.\n*   **Omission of Normals:** As instructed, it does not mention that the video is at regular speed, has no lens distortion, or lacks a Dutch angle, because these are the default states.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and easy to understand, providing a technical yet readable description of the shot. The breakdown of the complex movement into its constituent parts (dolly forward + pan left) is particularly well-executed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of both the video's technical attributes and the specific requirements of the captioning instructions.",
