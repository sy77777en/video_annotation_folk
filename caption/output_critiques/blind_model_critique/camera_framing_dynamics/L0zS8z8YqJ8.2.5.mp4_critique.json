    "pre_caption": "The camera is at an aerial level, maintaining a high angle as it moves rightward and forward, tracking a train from a bird's-eye view. It steadily zooms in to focus on a carriage. The camera uses deep focus, keeping everything sharp, and the movement is very smooth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves rightward and forward, tracking a train from a bird's-eye view while steadily zooming in to focus on a carriage.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side with an aerial perspective. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the aerial perspective and the general tracking movement, it contains a few inaccuracies and misses key details. The terms \"high angle\" and \"bird's-eye view\" are used interchangeably, but the shot is more likely a high angle, as a true bird's-eye view would be directly overhead, which seems inconsistent with a forward-moving track. The most significant issue is the claim of \"deep focus.\" As the camera zooms in on a single carriage, the depth of field would almost certainly become shallower, not remain deep. A more accurate description would be that the shot begins with a relatively deep focus, capturing the train and the surrounding landscape, and then transitions to a shallow depth of field as the camera dollies forward and zooms in, isolating the target carriage by softly blurring the distant mountains and the ground closer to the camera. Furthermore, describing the movement simply as \"rightward and forward\" is vague; \"diagonally tracking\" or \"dollying forward while trucking right\" would be more precise, and it's important to distinguish between a physical dolly and an optical zoom, as the visual effect is different.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera is positioned at a high angle, maintaining an aerial perspective as it diagonally tracks the train, dollying forward while trucking right. Initially, the shot captures the train and surrounding landscape with a relatively deep focus. As the camera zooms in on a single carriage, the depth of field becomes shallower, isolating the target carriage by softly blurring the distant mountains and the ground closer to the camera. The movement remains very smooth throughout the sequence.",
