    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The camera is positioned at eye level and uses a high angle, looking down at a phone held in the hands. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone in the midground. The camera remains completely static.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, complete according to the prompt's requirements, and perfectly adheres to the instructions for conciseness and terminology.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"Positioned at eye level and uses a high angle\" is a precise description. The shot mimics a person's point of view looking down at their phone, making \"eye level\" the correct relative height and \"high angle\" the correct downward perspective.\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"Employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the phone in the midground\" is perfectly accurate. The phone is sharp while the background is clearly blurred, and the phone occupies the midground of the frame.\n    *   **Movement:** \"The camera remains completely static\" is correct. There is no panning, tilting, zooming, or any other movement.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers all the relevant, non-default aspects of the shot: **camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and movement.**\n    *   It correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present, such as altered **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or a **Dutch angle**.\n    *   It uses the specific terminology requested in the instructions (e.g., \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground,\" \"static\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of what was requested. It provides a concise yet comprehensive technical description of the shot's configuration, demonstrating a clear understanding of both the video content and the detailed instructions. No improvements are needed.",
