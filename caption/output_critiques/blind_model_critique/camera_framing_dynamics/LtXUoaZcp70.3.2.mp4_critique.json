    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and is mostly accurate, but it contains one significant technical error regarding the camera movement. It successfully captures the general feel of the shot but fails on a key piece of terminology outlined in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **\"very smooth, slow shot\"**: Correct. The camera movement is exceptionally steady and proceeds at a slow, constant pace.\n    *   **\"level, eye-level camera\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned straight-on (level angle) and at a height that corresponds to the upper body of the central figure (eye-level).\n    *   **\"deep focus\"**: Correct. All elements, from the floor grid in the foreground to the figure in the midground and the walls in the background, are sharp and in focus.\n    *   **\"blue, holographic-like figure standing in the center\"**: Correct. This is an accurate description of the subject and its placement.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **\"...slowly zooms out\"**: **This is incorrect.** The camera is performing a **dolly out**, not a zoom out.\n        *   A **zoom** involves changing the lens's focal length, which magnifies the image but doesn't change the camera's physical position. This would cause the perspective to flatten or compress.\n        *   A **dolly** involves physically moving the entire camera backward. You can tell this is a dolly because the perspective of the circular room and the grid on the floor changes naturally as the camera moves through space. The spatial relationship between the foreground, midground, and background elements shifts, which only happens with physical movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most important aspects: camera steadiness, speed, angle, height, focus, and the primary movement.\n*   Following the instructions, it correctly omits mentions of **video speed** (which is regular), **lens distortion** (none is visible), and **Dutch angle** (the horizon is level). This shows good adherence to the conciseness rule.\n*   However, by misidentifying the movement as a \"zoom,\" it is incomplete in its technical description. The instructions specifically list \"dollying\" as a key movement type to identify.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and informative, as requested.\n*   **Terminology:** This is the main area of failure. The instructions provide a specific list of movements (panning, tilting, dollying, zooming, etc.) and expect them to be used correctly. Using \"zoom\" instead of \"dolly\" is a direct failure to apply the correct technical term.\n*   **Structure:** The caption is well-structured, describing the camera's static properties first (angle, height, focus) before describing its movement.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n**From a level, eye-level perspective with a deep focus, the camera performs a slow and steady dolly out, moving backward from a central, holographic figure to reveal the surrounding futuristic room.**",
