    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the foreground, and later becomes focused on the midground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is entirely accurate in its description of the video's technical and artistic elements:\n*   **\"High-angle shot\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down.\n*   **\"Extremely shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The plane of focus is very narrow, causing the background and parts of the foreground to be heavily blurred, which isolates the subject.\n*   **\"Moves backward smoothly\"**: Correct. The camera performs a smooth dolly-out movement, increasing the distance from the subject.\n*   **\"Initially focuses on the instruction manual in the foreground\"**: Correct. The shot begins with the manual in sharp focus.\n*   **\"Performing a rack focus to the person's hand in the midground\"**: Correct. The focus plane is deliberately shifted from the manual (foreground) to the hand reaching into the box (midground), which is a perfect example of a rack focus.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully captures all the significant and non-standard aspects of the shot without including unnecessary information:\n*   It correctly identifies the most prominent features: the camera angle, the distinct depth of field, the camera movement, and the dynamic focus change.\n*   It follows the instruction to be concise by correctly omitting details that are standard or absent, such as:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n    *   **Camera Steadiness:** This is covered by the word \"smoothly,\" which is sufficient.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a complete understanding of the instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a large amount of precise information into a single, easy-to-read sentence.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology accurately (e.g., \"high-angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"foreground,\" \"midground,\" \"rack focus\").\n*   **Describes Key Elements:** It covers all the relevant points from the instructions: camera angle, movement (translation), steadiness, and focus (depth, focus plane, and focus changes).\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description follows the action chronologically, describing the initial state (focus on the manual) and the subsequent actions (moving backward while performing a rack focus).",
