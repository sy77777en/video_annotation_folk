    "pre_caption": "The video features a static camera positioned at eye level with a level angle. It employs deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It is almost entirely inaccurate and fails to describe the key visual characteristics of the shot.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is incorrect:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The caption claims the camera is **\"static,\"** which is false. The camera is clearly moving, performing a slow, smooth **trucking shot** from left to right, following the action of the hands typing across the keyboard.\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The caption states the camera is at **\"eye level with a level angle.\"** This is also incorrect. The camera is positioned at a **low height** (approximately desk-level) and uses a **low angle**, looking slightly up at the hands and keyboard.\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** The most significant error is the description of the focus. The caption claims it uses **\"deep focus\"** with a **\"large depth of field.\"** The video does the exact opposite. It employs a very **shallow depth of field**, where only the specific keys being pressed are in sharp focus. The foreground, background, and even other parts of the keyboard are intentionally blurred to guide the viewer's attention.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption completely omits the camera's movement (trucking left to right), which is a primary element the instructions require you to describe.\n    *   By misidentifying the height, angle, and focus, it fails to provide an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n\n### Corrected Caption:\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately follows the instructions for this video:\n\n**The camera, positioned at a low height with a low angle, performs a slow and steady trucking shot from left to right. The shot utilizes a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground plane of the keyboard in sharp focus while the foreground and background remain blurred.**",
