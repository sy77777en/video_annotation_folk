    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot, indicating a first-person, head-mounted perspective.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot, suggesting a first-person, head-mounted perspective.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a first-person POV with a bird's-eye view, rolling counterclockwise as the person turns left to place a brick on the wall. The movement is noticeably unsteady.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant error in describing the camera angle and is incomplete in its description of camera movement and lens characteristics. While it correctly identifies the perspective, height, and focus, it misinterprets a key movement and omits required details.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"starts with a bird's-eye view\"**: Correct. The camera is initially pointed straight down at the ground.\n    *   **\"indicating a first-person, head-mounted perspective\"**: Correct. The movement and position strongly suggest a camera mounted on the subject's head.\n    *   **\"The camera is at eye level\"**: Correct. Relative to the person, the camera is at their eye level.\n    *   **\"uses deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. Both the foreground (hands, brick) and the midground (wall) are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field. (Note: \"deep focus\" and \"large depth of field\" are redundant, but the observation is correct).\n    *   **\"rolling counterclockwise\"**: Correct. As the person turns their head, the horizon of the wall rotates counterclockwise in the frame.\n    *   **\"The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking\"**: Correct. The movement is characteristic of a head-mounted camera during physical activity.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot\"**: This is the main error. The camera is never \"upside-down,\" nor does it end in a \"high-angle shot.\" It starts with a bird's-eye view and transitions to a **level angle** as the person looks forward at the wall they are building. The disorienting feeling comes from the combination of a **tilt up**, a **pan left**, and a **roll counterclockwise**, not from being upside-down.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing key information required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Lens Distortion**: The video has very obvious **barrel distortion**, typical of a wide-angle action camera (like a GoPro). The straight lines of the bricks and the horizon curve outwards, especially near the edges of the frame. This was not mentioned.\n*   **Camera Movement**: The description of the movement is incomplete. It correctly identifies the **roll**, but it completely omits the primary movements:\n    *   **Tilt Up**: The camera tilts from looking at the ground to looking forward at the wall.\n    *   **Pan Left**: The camera rotates horizontally to the left as the person turns their head.\n    The caption should describe the full, complex movement in order.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully followed instructions to describe **camera height**, **initial angle**, **focus/depth of field**, and **steadiness**.\n*   It failed to follow the instruction to describe **lens distortion** when present.\n*   It failed to provide a complete and accurate description of the **camera movements**, missing the key terms *tilt* and *pan*.\n*   The instruction to be concise was partially ignored due to redundant phrasing like \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" and stating the first-person perspective twice (\"first-person, head-mounted perspective\" and \"captures a first-person POV\").\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**From an eye-level, first-person perspective, the video exhibits noticeable barrel distortion. The shot begins with a bird's-eye view before the unsteady, head-mounted camera simultaneously tilts up, pans left, and rolls counterclockwise to follow the action of placing a brick. A deep depth of field keeps the entire scene in sharp focus.**",
