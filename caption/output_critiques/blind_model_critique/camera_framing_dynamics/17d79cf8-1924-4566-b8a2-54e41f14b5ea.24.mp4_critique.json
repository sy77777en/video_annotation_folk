    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot, indicating a first-person, head-mounted perspective. The camera is at eye level and uses deep focus with a large depth of field. It captures a first-person POV, rolling counterclockwise as the person turns left to place a brick on the wall. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with a bird's-eye view and transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot, suggesting a first-person, head-mounted perspective.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a first-person POV with a bird's-eye view, rolling counterclockwise as the person turns left to place a brick on the wall. The movement is noticeably unsteady.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a decent overview, but it contains several contradictions and lacks precision, making it difficult to visualize the scene accurately. The description of the camera angle and height is confusing; a shot cannot simultaneously be a \"bird's-eye view,\" \"high-angle,\" and at \"eye level.\" A head-mounted camera is by definition at the subject's eye level, but the *angle* changes based on where they look. It would be more accurate to state that the video begins with a high-angle shot from the subject's perspective as they look down, perhaps at the bricks on the ground. The phrase \"transitions to an upside-down high-angle shot\" is also unclear. Based on the subsequent description of a \"rolling counterclockwise\" motion, it's more likely the camera introduces a severe Dutch angle as the person tilts their head, rather than becoming fully inverted. A better description would be: \"The camera rolls approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise as the subject cocks their head to place the brick.\" Furthermore, the caption should specify the type of downward movement—is it a \"tilt down\" as the person looks lower, or a \"pedestal down\" as they crouch? Lastly, given this is likely a head-mounted action camera, you should mention the presence of a wide-angle lens and any resulting *barrel distortion*, which would cause straight lines near the frame's edge to appear slightly curved.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a high-angle shot from the subject's perspective as they look down at the bricks on the ground. The camera, mounted at eye level, uses a wide-angle lens, resulting in some barrel distortion that causes straight lines near the frame's edge to appear slightly curved. As the person tilts their head to the left to place a brick on the wall, the camera rolls approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise, introducing a severe Dutch angle. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and the camera tilts down as the person looks lower.",
