    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera positioned at eye level, capturing the scene from a low angle, looking up at the airplane.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but unsteady with noticeble shaking, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. It contains a critical inaccuracy and is incomplete.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** `eye level` is a reasonable assumption, and `low angle` is correct as the camera is looking up at the airplane.\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus` is accurate. Both the airplane (midground/background) and the clouds (far background) are in sharp focus.\n    *   **Steadiness:** `noticeable shaking` is correct. The camera is very unsteady, which is a key characteristic of the shot.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The statement that the **\"camera is fixed\" is fundamentally incorrect.** A fixed camera would remain stationary, and the airplane would fly across and out of the frame. In the video, the camera operator is actively moving the camera to follow the airplane's path. This is the most significant error in the caption.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to describe the primary camera movements, which is a core requirement of the instructions.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Type of Movement:** The caption completely misses the intentional camera movements. It should have identified that the camera is **tracking** the subject.\n    *   **Direction of Movement:** It fails to mention that the camera **pans right** and **tilts up** to keep the airplane centered in the frame.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement if relevant. Here, the clear purpose is to follow the airplane, which is not mentioned.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the most important instructions regarding camera movement.\n\n*   The instructions state: \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static. **If it moves, describe the type, direction, steadiness, and speed of movement.**\" The caption incorrectly identifies the camera as static (\"fixed\") and therefore fails to provide the required description of its movement (tracking, panning, tilting).\n*   While it correctly describes the *steadiness* (\"shaking\"), it presents this as an attribute of a fixed camera, which is contradictory. The shaking is a result of the camera being handheld *while moving*.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a low, eye-level angle, the unsteady, handheld camera pans right and tilts up to track a low-flying airplane. The focus is deep, keeping both the airplane and the clouds in the background sharp throughout the continuous shot.\"**",
