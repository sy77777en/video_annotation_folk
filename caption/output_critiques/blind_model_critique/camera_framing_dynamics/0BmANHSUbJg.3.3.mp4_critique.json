    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera positioned at eye level, capturing the scene from a low angle, looking up at the airplane. The camera maintains a deep focus, ensuring all elements remain sharp. Although the camera is fixed, it exhibits noticeable shaking, adding a sense of instability to the footage.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but unsteady with noticeble shaking, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the low angle and camera shake, it contains several inaccuracies and omissions that fail to capture the likely dynamics of the video. The description of the camera as \"fixed\" is contradictory to the act of filming a moving airplane; it is almost certainly panning and tilting to track the aircraft as it moves across the runway and ascends into the sky. The caption should specify this tracking movement, noting the direction and speed of the pan and the subsequent upward tilt. Furthermore, the description of the camera height as \"eye level\" and the angle as \"low\" is confusing without context; a better description would be that the camera is held at eye-level height and starts at a level angle, which then becomes a low angle as the operator tilts upward to follow the plane's climb. The claim of \"deep focus\" is also questionable, as a shot focused on a distant plane would likely render the immediate foreground (perhaps a fence or runway markings) slightly out of focus, indicating a more conventional depth of field rather than true deep focus. Finally, the \"noticeable shaking\" could be described with more nuance; it is likely a minor, natural handheld wobble that becomes more pronounced as the operator tilts and pans, and if there's a second, zoomed-in shot of the plane in the air, the caption fails to mention the cut and the significantly amplified shaking caused by the tighter framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dynamic scene of an airplane taking off, with the camera initially held at eye-level height and starting at a level angle. As the airplane moves across the runway and ascends into the sky, the camera pans and tilts upward to track its movement, creating a low-angle perspective. The camera exhibits a natural handheld wobble, which becomes more pronounced during the panning and tilting. The focus is primarily on the airplane, with the immediate foreground slightly out of focus, indicating a conventional depth of field. If there is a cut to a zoomed-in shot of the plane in the air, the tighter framing amplifies the shaking, adding to the dynamic feel of the footage.",
