    "pre_caption": "This is a fast-moving, unsteady time-lapse shot filmed from an eye-level, level angle. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the foreground in focus. The shot features a rapid dolly zoom effect: the camera first moves backward while zooming in on the man, then slightly moves forward while zooming out at the very end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video played forward at a greatly accelerated speed (more than 3× real-time), showing time passing rapidly over a long period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera first moves backward while zooming in, then slightly moves forward and zooms out at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good technical foundation but misses the opportunity to describe the powerful visual and emotional impact of the techniques used. The term \"fast-moving, unsteady time-lapse\" is slightly redundant; a more precise term might be \"unsteady hyperlapse,\" which better communicates a time-lapse with significant camera movement. While the camera starts at an eye-level, level angle, the significant dolly-out motion would likely cause the perspective to shift, ending in a slightly high angle relative to the man, a detail the caption omits. The description of the dolly zoom is mechanically correct but fails to capture its primary visual effect: as the camera dollies back and zooms in, the man remains a constant size while the background (perhaps a bustling city street or a sprawling landscape) appears to dramatically expand and warp, creating a powerful sense of vertigo or psychological distress. The caption should specify this distortion of the background. Furthermore, describing the man as being in the \"foreground\" is only true at the start; as the camera moves back, he transitions to the midground. Finally, the caption lacks any mention of purpose. The combination of a hyperlapse and a dolly zoom is a highly stylistic choice, likely intended to convey the man's feeling of being overwhelmed, detached, or trapped in a world that is moving too fast around him, which is a critical piece of information for a comprehensive description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This unsteady hyperlapse shot begins at an eye-level angle and transitions to a slightly high angle as the camera moves. The shallow depth of field keeps the man initially in the foreground, but as the camera dollies back and zooms in, he shifts to the midground. This dolly zoom effect maintains the man's size while the background dramatically expands and warps, creating a powerful sense of vertigo and psychological distress. The bustling city street or sprawling landscape behind him seems to rush and distort, emphasizing his feelings of being overwhelmed and detached in a world moving too fast. This stylistic choice effectively conveys the man's emotional turmoil and sense of entrapment.",
