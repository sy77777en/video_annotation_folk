    "pre_caption": "This video is filmed with a level camera angle and deep focus. The camera smoothly dollies backward, revealing that the initial low-angle shot of a soccer player is actually an image within a picture frame resting on a table. The content within the frame continuously rotates as the camera pulls back.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera initially presents a low-angle shot within the picture frame. However, as the video reveals that the picture frame itself is moving while resting on a table in the bedroom, it becomes clear that the camera angle is actually level.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video appears to have deep focus overall, though the low resolution makes it somewhat difficult to determine the exact focus type.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward throughout the video, focusing on the picture frame with continuously rotating content.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good overview, but it contains a potential contradiction and misses several key details that would make it more accurate and informative. The description of a \"level camera angle\" conflicts with the \"initial low-angle shot\"; it would be clearer to state that the camera begins at table-level with a level angle *on the picture frame*, while the *content* within the frame depicts a low-angle view of the player. The term \"pulls backward\" could be more precise by using \"dolly out.\" It's also likely that as the camera dollies out, it simultaneously pedestals up slightly to keep the frame centered as the perspective changes, a combined movement that isn't mentioned. The claim of \"deep focus\" is questionable, as a shot like this would more effectively use a shallow depth of field to isolate the table and frame from the background, making the reveal more impactful; if the background is indeed blurry, the caption is incorrect. Lastly, the description of the content's rotation is ambiguous; specifying that it's a 3D model of the player performing a 360-degree clockwise rotation on a central axis would provide a much clearer picture of the dynamic effect within the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a camera positioned at table level, maintaining a level angle on a picture frame. Inside the frame, a low-angle view of a soccer player is depicted. As the camera dollies out and slightly pedestals up to keep the frame centered, the background is softly blurred, enhancing the focus on the table and frame. Within the frame, a 3D model of the player performs a 360-degree clockwise rotation on a central axis, creating a dynamic visual effect.",
