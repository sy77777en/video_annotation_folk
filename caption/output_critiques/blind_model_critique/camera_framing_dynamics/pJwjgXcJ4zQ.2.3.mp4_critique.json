    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle, capturing a first-person POV moving forward along a bustling urban street. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The movement is slightly unsteady with noticeable handheld shakiness, enhancing the immersive experience of walking through the street.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This video captures a first-person POV moving forward along a bustling urban street, with noticeable handheld shakiness.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, being both accurate in its description and concise by omitting unnecessary information. It successfully captures the key technical and stylistic elements of the video.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it presents:\n\n*   **Camera Configuration:**\n    *   `eye level with a level camera angle`: **Correct.** The camera is held at a height consistent with a person's head, and the horizon is kept parallel to the frame, indicating a level angle.\n    *   `first-person POV`: **Correct.** The perspective, movement, and height strongly suggest a first-person point of view.\n*   **Movement:**\n    *   `moving forward`: **Correct.** The primary camera movement is a forward translation (dolly in) along the street.\n    *   `slightly unsteady with noticeable handheld shakiness`: **Correct.** The camera exhibits the natural, subtle bobbing and swaying motion of being handheld by a walking person, rather than being on a perfectly smooth stabilizer like a gimbal or dolly.\n*   **Focus:**\n    *   `deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp`: **Correct.** Objects in the foreground (pedestrians), midground (signs, storefronts), and background (distant buildings) are all in acceptable focus. There is no significant background blur (bokeh), indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **Purpose:**\n    *   `enhancing the immersive experience of walking through the street`: **Correct.** This is an accurate interpretation of the filmmaker's intent. The handheld shakiness is not a flaw but a stylistic choice to make the viewer feel like they are the one walking.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by including all relevant information while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included Elements:** The caption successfully covers all the pertinent aspects of the video: camera height, angle, movement (translation, steadiness, purpose), and focus/depth of field.\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed. As per the instructions, this does not need to be mentioned.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable fisheye or barrel distortion. The caption correctly omits this.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The camera is level, so there is no Dutch angle to describe.\n    *   **Complex Movements:** The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or arc. The caption rightly focuses only on the forward movement and unsteadiness.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static. The caption correctly avoids mentioning rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres perfectly to the spirit and letter of the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into a single, readable paragraph without being overly verbose.\n*   **Clarity and Terminology:** It uses precise and appropriate terminology (e.g., \"deep focus,\" \"depth of field,\" \"handheld shakiness,\" \"level camera angle\") that is easy to understand.\n*   **Follows Negative Constraints:** Crucially, it follows the rule of not mentioning standard or absent features (like regular speed or no distortion), which is key to achieving conciseness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary response to the instructions. It is accurate, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly concise by omitting non-applicable information. It serves as a great template for how to write a technical video description according to the provided guidelines.",
