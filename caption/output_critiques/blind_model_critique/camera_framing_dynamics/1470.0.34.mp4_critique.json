    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is mostly good and captures several key aspects of the shot correctly. However, it contains **one significant error** regarding the focus and depth of field, which misrepresents a key stylistic choice of the cinematography.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle\" is accurate. The camera is held at a height that aligns with the subjects' upper bodies and faces, and the horizon is perfectly level.\n    *   **Camera Movement & Steadiness:** \"It moves smoothly backward, leading the group of people from the front with minimal shaking\" is also very accurate. The movement is a backward dolly/tracking shot, it is exceptionally smooth (likely on a gimbal or Steadicam), and it effectively leads the subjects.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** The phrase \"capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field\" is **incorrect**.\n        *   **Reasoning:** The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**. The subjects (the group of people) are in sharp focus, but the background elements (the trees, the path behind them) are noticeably and intentionally blurred.\n        *   **Correction:** Deep focus would render both the subjects in the foreground/midground and the distant background in sharp detail. This shot does the opposite, using a shallow focus to isolate the subjects and make them stand out.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is commendably concise, as instructed. It correctly omits details that are not present, such as altered video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles.\n*   It successfully describes the most important aspects: camera position, the primary movement, and steadiness.\n*   The description of the movement's purpose (\"leading the group of people from the front\") is a great, informative addition.\n*   The main area where it is incomplete is in its description of focus. A complete description would have correctly identified the shallow depth of field and noted that the focus plane is maintained on the moving subjects.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\n*   **Strong Adherence:** The caption writer clearly attempted to follow the instructions by addressing the specific categories: camera height, angle, movement, steadiness, and focus. The language is concise and descriptive.\n*   **Partial Failure:** The failure is not in ignoring the instruction, but in misapplying it. The instruction asks for a description of focus and depth of field, and while the caption provides one, it uses the wrong terminology for what is visually present in the video.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere are two improved versions that accurately describe the video according to your instructions.\n\n**Option 1 (More Technical):**\n> Positioned at an eye-level, level angle, the camera captures the scene with a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the subjects in focus while blurring the background. It performs a smooth **dolly backward**, tracking the group from the front with excellent stability and minimal shaking.\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly Simpler):**\n> The camera maintains an eye-level, level angle and uses a **shallow depth of field** to make the subjects stand out from the blurred background. It moves smoothly backward, leading the group of people with minimal shaking.",
