    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming out and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies the primary camera movements and focus but misses some key details required by the instructions and contains a minor inaccuracy regarding the camera angle.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Deep Focus:** The caption correctly identifies the \"deep focus,\" as both the foreground building and the background sky remain sharp throughout the shot.\n    *   **Movement Combination:** The description of the camera \"smoothly zooms out while tilting up\" is perfectly accurate. These are the two main movements, and they occur simultaneously and smoothly.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Imprecise:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption states the video has a \"level camera angle.\" This is only true for the first moment of the video. The camera immediately begins tilting up, transitioning into a **low angle** as it looks up at the building. A more accurate description would note this transition.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The caption uses the phrase \"minimal shaking.\" While technically true (as there is less than \"moderate\" shaking), it implies a slight imperfection. The shot is extremely stable, so \"steady,\" \"smooth,\" or \"no discernible shaking\" would be more precise and better reflect the professional quality of the movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The instructions ask for the camera's height (e.g., eye-level, ground-level). The shot appears to be filmed from **eye-level** or slightly above, but this detail is omitted.\n    *   **Angle Transition:** As mentioned under accuracy, the caption fails to describe the *change* in camera angle from level to low, a dynamic element the instructions specifically ask to be noted.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** While implied, the caption could more explicitly state the purpose of the movement, which is to start with a detail of the building and pull back to reveal its full height and architectural scale.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Where it Adheres Well:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise.\n    *   **Focus on Key Elements:** It correctly focuses on movement (zoom, tilt), steadiness, and focus (depth), which are central to the shot.\n    *   **Omission of Absent Features:** It correctly avoids mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, as none are present, following the instruction to be economical.\n\n*   **Where it Falls Short:**\n    *   It fails to \"specify the camera angle... noting any shifts within the video.\" The shift from a level to a low angle is a key part of the shot that was missed.\n    *   It does not \"describe the camera height in relation to the ground.\"\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and more fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a steady, eye-level position, the camera smoothly and simultaneously tilts up and zooms out. The angle begins level and transitions to a low angle to reveal the building's entire facade. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp throughout the movement.\"**",
