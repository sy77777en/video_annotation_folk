    "pre_caption": "This is a smooth tracking shot that follows a biker performing stunts on a moving train. The camera executes a counterclockwise arc around the biker, starting from an overhead level and pedestaling down to eye level. As it moves, the camera also gets slightly closer to the subject. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the biker, the train, and the rural background sharp and clear.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an overhead level (around second floor height) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc around the biker while having a slight pedestal down motion throughout. The camera moves slightly closer to the biker during the video.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while arcing around them.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written and accurate caption that adheres closely to the instructions. It effectively describes the complex camera work in a concise manner.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **\"smooth tracking shot that follows a biker\"**: Correct. The camera moves alongside the subject, which is the definition of a tracking shot, and the movement is exceptionally smooth.\n*   **\"counterclockwise arc around the biker\"**: Correct. The camera starts on the biker's right side and circles around their back to their left, which is a counterclockwise motion from an overhead perspective.\n*   **\"starting from an overhead level and pedestaling down to eye level\"**: The height description is perfect. The term \"pedestaling down\" is mostly correct as it describes the vertical descent. A slightly more precise term might be **\"craning down\"** since the camera is moving down as part of a larger arc, not just a simple vertical drop. However, \"pedestaling\" is widely understood and acceptable here.\n*   **\"camera also gets slightly closer to the subject\"**: Correct. There is a subtle dolly-in movement throughout the shot.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the biker, the train, and the rural background sharp and clear\"**: Correct. All planes of the image (foreground, midground, and background) are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n\n### Completeness: Excellent\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested by the instructions while correctly omitting the non-applicable points.\n\n*   **Movement**: It thoroughly describes the complex camera movement by combining multiple terms: tracking, arcing, and pedestaling/craning.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle**: It clearly states the starting height (\"overhead level\") and ending height (\"eye level\").\n*   **Focus**: It correctly identifies the \"deep focus\" and explains what that means in the context of the shot.\n*   **Omissions**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none of these are present. This demonstrates good adherence to the conciseness rule.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction: Excellent\nThe caption follows the instructions precisely.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical detail into just three sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It uses the correct technical terms (tracking shot, arc, overhead level, eye level, deep focus) as specified in the prompt.\n*   **Structure**: It logically describes the primary action first (tracking shot), then breaks down the complex movement, and finishes with the focus characteristics.\n\n### Verdict\n\n**Yes, the caption is excellent.**\n\nIt is a professional, accurate, and comprehensive description that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the detailed instructions. The one minor point of feedback is the use of \"pedestaling\" vs. \"craning,\" which is a fine point of cinematography terminology and does not detract from the overall quality and clarity of the caption.\n\nFor a slightly more technically precise version, you could write:\n\n\"This is a smooth tracking shot that follows a biker on a moving train. The camera starts at an overhead level and **cranes down** to eye level while executing a counterclockwise arc and moving slightly closer to the subject. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the biker, the train, and the rural background sharp and clear.\"",
