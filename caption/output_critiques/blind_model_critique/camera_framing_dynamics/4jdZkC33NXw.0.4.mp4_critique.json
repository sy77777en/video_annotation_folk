    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic eye-level perspective and forward motion, it overlooks several key details that would bring the scene to life. For instance, describing the movement simply as \"slightly unsteady\" misses the opportunity to specify the natural, rhythmic vertical bobbing and slight side-to-side sway characteristic of a walking pace, as well as the slow, subtle pans left and right as the camera operator glances at the house numbers and architectural details. The video likely uses a wide-angle lens, which would introduce mild barrel distortion, causing the straight lines of the curbs and rooflines to curve slightly at the edges of the frame—a detail the caption omits. Furthermore, while \"deep focus\" is mentioned, it might be more accurate to describe it as a wide depth of field where the distant end of the street is slightly soft, especially since the video was shot in the low light of dusk, where reflections from the wet pavement create bright specular highlights and lens flare as the camera passes under streetlights. Finally, the caption fails to mention the video's playback speed, which appears to be normal, real-time speed, a crucial piece of information for understanding the pacing of the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, held at eye level, moves forward down the center of a wet residential street with a natural, rhythmic vertical bobbing and slight side-to-side sway, characteristic of a walking pace. As the operator glances at house numbers and architectural details, the camera subtly pans left and right. A wide-angle lens introduces mild barrel distortion, causing the straight lines of curbs and rooflines to curve slightly at the edges of the frame. The scene is captured with a wide depth of field, keeping most of the view sharp, though the distant end of the street appears slightly soft. Shot in the low light of dusk, reflections from the wet pavement create bright specular highlights and lens flare as the camera passes under streetlights. The video plays back at normal, real-time speed, providing a true-to-life pacing of the shot.",
