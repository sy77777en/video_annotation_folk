    "pre_caption": "This is a static, time-lapse video shot from a level angle above the water. The camera remains completely still, employing a deep focus that keeps the entire scene, from the foreground shore to the distant bridge, sharp and clear.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video showing time passing rapidly over a long period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **\"static, time-lapse video\"**: This is correct. The camera does not move, and the rapid movement of the clouds and the shimmering water clearly indicate a time-lapse.\n*   **\"shot from a level angle above the water\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned higher than the water's surface, looking straight across at the horizon, which is not tilted.\n*   **\"The camera remains completely still\"**: This correctly reinforces that the shot is static, with no panning, tilting, or shaking.\n*   **\"employing a deep focus that keeps the entire scene... sharp and clear\"**: This is a perfect description. Both the foreground rocks and the distant bridge are in sharp focus, demonstrating a deep depth of field.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions without adding unnecessary information:\n*   **Video Speed**: Correctly identified as **time-lapse**.\n*   **Camera Movement**: Correctly identified as **static**.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height**: Correctly described as **level angle** and **above the water**.\n*   **Focus**: Correctly described as **deep focus**, with specific details about what is in focus (foreground to background).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption is concise and effective. It avoids mentioning standard attributes like the absence of lens distortion or a Dutch angle, as instructed.\n*   **Informativeness**: It provides all the key technical details requested, giving a comprehensive overview of the shot's configuration.\n*   **Clarity**: The language is clear and easy to understand. The description of the deep focus is particularly well-articulated.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It accurately and completely describes the video's technical characteristics in a concise and informative manner.",
