    "pre_caption": "Viewed through the circular frame of what appears to be a night vision scope, the camera is positioned at a fixed, eye-level, and level angle, though it remains slightly unsteady.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a solid foundation, but it overlooks several key visual details that would likely be present in such a video, making it feel incomplete. The description of the camera as \"fixed\" while also being \"slightly unsteady\" is contradictory; it would be more accurate to describe it as a handheld shot with minimal, naturalistic shaking or drift. The caption also fails to mention the distinct visual artifacts inherent to night vision, such as the monochromatic green tint, significant digital noise or grain, and the probable presence of moderate *barrel distortion*, which would cause the straight lines of the road to bow outwards. While you correctly identify the circular frame, you miss the opportunity to describe any on-screen graphics, like a reticle or digital compass, which would exist on a separate, perfectly sharp focal plane in the extreme foreground. Finally, the assumption of \"deep focus\" might be an oversimplification; it's more likely that the focus is locked on the midground where the road is most visible, leaving the immediate foreground and the most distant trees slightly soft, creating a more realistic, albeit still significant, depth of field than the term \"deep focus\" implies.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is viewed through the circular frame of what appears to be a night vision scope, characterized by a monochromatic green tint and significant digital noise or grain. The camera is handheld, resulting in minimal, naturalistic shaking or drift. The scene captures a nighttime view of a rural road with distant trees, where the focus is locked on the midground, making the road most visible while leaving the immediate foreground and distant trees slightly soft. This creates a realistic depth of field. The straight lines of the road exhibit moderate barrel distortion, causing them to bow outwards.
