    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent, high-level summary but fails to meet the specific requirements of the instructions. It is inaccurate in its description of focus and, most importantly, incomplete because it completely ignores the multiple shot transitions, treating the video as a single, continuous take.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   \"forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle\": This is correct. The camera is consistently moving forward from a first-person perspective at a normal height and angle.\n    *   \"slightly unsteady with some shaking\": This accurately describes the natural wobble of a handheld camera.\n    *   \"progresses down the street, focusing on the urban environment and pedestrians\": This correctly identifies the purpose and subject of the shot.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   \"It employs deep focus, capturing a large depth of field\": This is incorrect. **Deep focus** is a specific cinematic term where the foreground, midground, and background are all in sharp focus simultaneously (e.g., *Citizen Kane*). This video exhibits a **moderately deep depth of field**, which is typical for a standard camera lens shooting in bright daylight. The background is noticeably softer and more blurred than the midground where the action is, meaning it is not true deep focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Shot Transitions:** This is the most significant omission. The video is not one continuous shot. It consists of **three separate shots** joined by **hard cuts** (at approximately 0:04 and 0:08). The instructions explicitly state: \"When shot transitions occur, describe the camera framing and movement in each segment separately, note the type of transition...\" The caption fails to do this entirely.\n*   **Movement Terminology:** While \"forward-moving\" is correct, the instructions encourage more specific terms. The movement is a **dolly forward**. The unsteadiness is characteristic of a **handheld** shot.\n*   **Focus Plane:** The caption mentions depth of field but does not specify the **focus plane**, which is consistently on the **midground** (the path directly ahead of the camera).\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Followed:**\n    *   The caption is concise.\n    *   It correctly omits mentions of video speed (which is regular), lens distortion (none), and Dutch angle (none), as per the instruction to avoid mentioning normal or absent features.\n\n*   **Not Followed:**\n    *   The instruction to describe shot transitions and segments separately was completely ignored. This is the primary failure in adhering to the prompt.\n    *   The description of focus lacks the precision requested (distinguishing between deep focus and depth of field, identifying the focus plane).\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that correctly follows all the given instructions:\n\n\"The video consists of three shots connected by hard cuts, all sharing a similar configuration. In each shot, a handheld camera **dollies forward** at **eye-level** with a **level angle**. The movement has a moderate, natural shakiness. The camera maintains a **moderately deep depth of field**, keeping the midground path and pedestrians in focus while the background remains slightly soft.\"",
