    "pre_caption": "This point-of-view shot is captured by a camera mounted on the skier's helmet, leading her from the front and looking down. The video features a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The camera begins at a high, eye-level angle before the skier launches into the air. As she executes a smooth, high-difficulty 360-degree roll, the camera moves to an overhead level and rotates with her, transitioning through an upside-down high angle and a worm's eye view before returning to a level angle. The shot is characterized by noticeable fisheye distortion and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout the entire maneuver.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera begins with a high angle looking down. As the subject jumps into the air and completes a full rotation, the camera angle also undergoes an almost 360-degree transformation—shifting to an upside-down high angle, then to a worm's eye angle, and finally returning to a level angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is mounted on the skier's helmet, looking down at her from the front as they launch off the slope, executing a high-difficulty 360-degree roll mid-air.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies key elements like the speed ramp, fisheye distortion, and deep focus, its description of the camera's position and movement could be more precise and less contradictory. The term \"point-of-view\" is misleading; a \"third-person follow shot\" or \"selfie-stick perspective\" would be more accurate, as the camera is clearly observing the skier from the front, likely on an extension pole, rather than showing her direct line of sight. The initial description of a \"high, eye-level angle\" is a contradiction; the shot is a consistent *high angle* relative to the skier, not at eye-level. Most critically, the description of the movement during the aerial trick is convoluted. Instead of a complex sequence of angles like \"upside-down high angle,\" it would be clearer to state that the camera, being fixed to the skier, performs a continuous *roll* in sync with her 360-degree maneuver. This single, fluid motion is what causes the world to spin, and mentioning the \"roll\" is essential to accurately describe the primary camera movement that defines the trick. The current phrasing makes it sound as if an independent camera operator is repositioning, rather than the camera being a passive extension of the athlete's body.",
