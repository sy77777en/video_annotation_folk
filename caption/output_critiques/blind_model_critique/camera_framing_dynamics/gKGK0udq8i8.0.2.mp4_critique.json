    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and closely follows the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a camera positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring clarity throughout the scene. The camera moves smoothly backward, with minimal shaking, providing a steady viewing experience.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: High\nThe descriptive points in the caption are all factually correct for the video provided.\n*   **\"camera positioned at hip level, maintaining a level angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is held at a height consistent with a person's waist or hip, and the vertical and horizontal lines are straight, indicating a level angle.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: This is correct. All elements, from the midground pillars to the distant background, are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"camera moves smoothly backward, with minimal shaking\"**: This is also accurate. The movement is a consistent backward motion, and while there is a very slight sway from being handheld, it is extremely well-stabilized, qualifying as \"smooth\" with \"minimal shaking.\"\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Good\nThe caption successfully identifies and describes the most prominent technical features of the shot.\n*   **Included:** It correctly covers camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and movement (type, steadiness).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):** It correctly omits details that are not present, adhering to the instruction: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"*\n    *   **Video Speed:** Regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** None is visible.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** Not present.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** There is only one continuous shot.\n\nThe caption is comprehensive without being verbose.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It avoids filler words and gets straight to the technical description.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses the correct terms specified in the instructions, such as \"hip level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"large depth of field.\"\n*   **Movement Description:** It accurately describes the direction (\"backward\") and steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"minimal shaking\").\n*   **Focus Description:** It correctly identifies the \"deep focus\" and \"large depth of field.\"\n\n### Areas for Minor Improvement\n\nWhile the caption is already very good, it could be made slightly more professional and concise by incorporating more technical terminology and removing phrases that state the obvious result of a technical choice.\n\n*   The term for moving a camera backward is **\"dollying out\"** or **\"dollying backward.\"** Using this term would be more precise.\n*   The phrases *\"ensuring clarity throughout the scene\"* and *\"providing a steady viewing experience\"* are redundant. \"Deep focus\" already implies clarity, and \"moves smoothly with minimal shaking\" already implies a steady experience. Removing them would make the caption more concise, as requested.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates these minor improvements, making it even more aligned with the expert tone of the instructions:\n\n**\"The camera, positioned at a hip-level with a level angle, steadily dollies backward. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**\n\nThis version is more concise and uses more precise industry terminology (\"dollies backward\") while conveying the exact same information. However, the original caption is still a very strong and accurate description.",
