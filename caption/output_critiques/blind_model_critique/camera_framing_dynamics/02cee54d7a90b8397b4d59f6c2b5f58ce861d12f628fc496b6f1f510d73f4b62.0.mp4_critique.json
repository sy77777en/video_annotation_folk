    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and a level angle. It employs deep focus, maintaining clarity throughout the scene. The camera exhibits minor, slightly unsteady movement without clear intentional direction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. It contains several significant inaccuracies and fails to completely describe the camera's configuration and movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is inaccurate on several key points:\n\n*   **Correct:** The statement that the video is in **slow motion** and has a **level angle** is correct.\n*   **Incorrect - Camera Height:** The caption states the camera is at **\"eye level,\"** which is wrong. The camera is positioned very low to the ground, approximately at the subject's **knee-level or shin-level**, to capture the feet splashing in the water.\n*   **Incorrect - Focus:** The caption claims the video uses **\"deep focus,\"** which is the opposite of what is shown. The video clearly employs a **shallow depth of field**, as the subject (the person's legs and the splashing water in the midground) is in sharp focus while the background (trees and foliage) is significantly blurred.\n*   **Incorrect - Camera Movement:** The description of the movement as being **\"without clear intentional direction\"** is misleading. While the movement is slightly unsteady, it has a clear purpose: the camera performs a slow **pan to the right** to **track** the subject's movement across the frame, keeping the action centered.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it mischaracterizes or omits important details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement is insufficient. It correctly notes the unsteadiness but fails to identify the primary movement type (**panning**) and its purpose (**tracking the subject**).\n*   **Focus:** The caption fails to describe the focus plane. A complete description would note that the focus is set on the **midground**, where the subject is walking.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption does not adhere well to the instructions due to its inaccuracies and lack of detail.\n\n*   It fails to provide a \"concise yet **informative** description\" because key information about camera height, depth of field, and movement purpose is incorrect.\n*   It fails to properly describe the **camera height** (e.g., low-level), the **focus/depth of field** (shallow), and the **movement's type and purpose** (panning to track), all of which are explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### A Better Caption Example:\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately follows the instructions:\n\n\"This slow-motion video is shot from a **low, knee-level height** with a **level angle**. It uses a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the subject in the midground sharp while blurring the background. The camera performs a **slow, slightly unsteady pan to the right**, tracking the subject's feet as they splash through the water.\"",
