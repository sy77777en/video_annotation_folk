    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, capturing a level angle view of a snowy landscape. The camera then slightly rolls clockwise before quickly tilting downward to focus on a person’s hand steering a sled. It slightly tilts upward as the person turns the steering wheel. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp. The movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly rolls clockwise before quickly tilting downward, then slightly tilts upward as the person turns the steering wheel.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good and follows many of the instructions well, but it has one significant omission that makes it incomplete.\n\n### Evaluation Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n*   The descriptions of **camera height** (\"hip level\"), **initial angle** (\"level angle\"), **rotational movements** (\"rolls clockwise,\" \"tilting downward,\" \"tilts upward\"), and **focus** (\"deep focus with a large depth of field\") are all accurate for the video.\n*   The description of **steadiness** (\"smooth with minimal shaking\") is also correct.\n\n**2. Completeness: Incomplete**\n*   **What it does well:** The caption correctly identifies and describes the camera's rotational movements (roll and tilt), their speed (\"quickly,\" \"slightly\"), and their purpose. It also provides a perfect description of the focus and depth of field.\n*   **What is missing (Major Omission):** The caption completely fails to mention the camera's primary **translational movement**. The camera is on a moving sled, meaning it is constantly **dollying or tracking forward** throughout the entire shot. This forward motion is the most fundamental movement in the video, as it establishes the context of travel and speed. By only describing the minor rotational adjustments, the caption misses the main action of the shot.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Good**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting mentions of regular video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., \"rolls,\" \"tilting,\" \"hip level,\" \"deep focus\").\n*   **Movement Description:** It describes the sequence of rotational movements in the correct temporal order, as requested.\n*   **Failure to Adhere:** The instruction asks for a description of all movements, including \"translation (dollying, trucking...).\" The failure to describe the forward dolly movement is a direct violation of this core requirement.\n\n### Final Verdict:\n\nThe caption is well-written and accurate in the details it chooses to describe. However, by omitting the primary forward motion of the camera, it provides an incomplete picture of the shot's configuration. It's like describing a person turning a car's steering wheel without mentioning that the car is driving down a road.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption:\n\nTo be fully compliant and more descriptive, the caption should incorporate the forward movement. Here is a revised version:\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n\"From a hip-level, level-angle perspective, the camera smoothly **dollies forward** across a snowy landscape. It then slightly rolls clockwise before quickly tilting downward to focus on a person’s hand steering a sled, and tilts up slightly with the steering motion. The shot maintains a deep focus with minimal shaking, keeping all elements sharp.\"",
