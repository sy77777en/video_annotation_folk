    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward while gently panning to the left and tilting upward, drawing closer to the mannequin-like lady figure.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** This smooth, eye-level shot maintains a level angle. Utilizing a shallow depth of field, the camera focuses on the mannequin-like figure in the foreground. The camera moves forward while gently panning left and tilting up, closing in on the figure.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation**\n\nThe caption is good but contains a significant inaccuracy and a contradiction. It correctly identifies most of the key camera and video attributes but fails on one important detail.\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption is correct in describing the shot as **\"smooth,\"** at **\"eye-level,\"** with a **\"shallow depth of field,\"** and focusing on the **\"foreground.\"**\n*   **Contradiction and Inaccuracy:** The caption first states the shot **\"maintains a level angle,\"** which is incorrect. It then correctly states that the camera is **\"tilting up.\"** These two statements contradict each other. As the camera moves forward and gets closer to the figure, it must tilt upward to keep the figure's head and shoulders in the frame. Therefore, it starts at a level angle but does not maintain it.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   **Very Complete:** The caption successfully covers the most important aspects requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"smooth\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"eye-level\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"shallow depth of field,\" \"focuses on the... figure in the foreground\"\n    *   **Movements:** It correctly identifies the complex, simultaneous movements: \"moves forward\" (dollying), \"panning left,\" and \"tilting up.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption adheres well to the instruction for conciseness by correctly omitting any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all standard/absent in the video.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions**\n\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption follows the instructions well by using the specified terminology (e.g., \"shallow depth of field,\" \"panning,\" \"tilting\") and describing the camera's configuration.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The primary failure in adherence is the inaccurate description of the camera angle. The instructions specifically ask to note any shifts in angle, which this caption fails to do correctly.\n\n### **Revised, More Accurate Caption**\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracy:\n\n\"This smooth, eye-level shot begins with a level angle and utilizes a shallow depth of field to focus on the mannequin-like figure in the foreground. The camera simultaneously moves forward, pans gently left, and tilts up, transitioning to a slight low angle as it closes in on the figure.\"",
