    "pre_caption": "This slightly unsteady, handheld shot begins at eye level with a low angle, looking up at a kite in the sky. The camera then tilts downward and pans from right to left, shifting the focus to a little girl on the road. This movement changes the perspective to a high angle looking down at the girl. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera tilts downward and pans from right to left, shifting the focus from the sky to a little girl playing with a kite.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It is well-structured, concise, and accurately describes most of the camera's configuration and movement. However, it makes one significant error in describing the camera's focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"Slightly unsteady, handheld shot\" is perfectly accurate. The natural micro-movements clearly indicate it's not on a tripod.\n    *   **Initial Setup:** \"begins at eye level with a low angle, looking up at a kite\" is a precise and correct description of the shot's starting point.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** \"tilts downward and pans from right to left\" is an excellent, chronologically correct description of the compound movement.\n    *   **Final Angle:** \"changes the perspective to a high angle looking down at the girl\" is also accurate. The camera is now positioned above the subject (the girl), creating a high angle.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **Focus:** The final sentence, \"A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp,\" is **incorrect**.\n        *   **Explanation:** This video exhibits a **shallow depth of field**, not a deep one. When the camera focuses on the girl, the trees and landscape in the distant background are noticeably blurry. In a deep focus shot, the girl in the midground and the distant trees would be almost equally sharp. The caption misidentifies this key optical property.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is very complete in the aspects it chooses to cover. It successfully identifies and describes steadiness, height, angle, and movement.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as altered video speed or significant lens distortion, which aligns with the instruction to be concise and not mention standard configurations.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The instruction asks to describe focus changes. The caption says the movement is \"shifting the focus to a little girl,\" which correctly identifies the change in the *subject* of focus. However, it could be more technically precise by noting that the **focus plane shifts** from the background (the kite) to the midground (the girl). The current phrasing is acceptable for conciseness, but the final, incorrect statement about \"deep focus\" undermines it.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption does an excellent job of being concise while remaining informative, just as the instructions requested.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses clear and appropriate terminology (low angle, high angle, tilts, pans) as specified.\n*   **Structure:** The description follows the temporal flow of the video, describing the initial state, the movement, and the final state, which is a logical and effective structure.\n*   **Handling Omissions:** It correctly follows the rule to omit mention of standard video speed, lack of distortion, and lack of a Dutch angle.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the error and more accurately reflects the video's properties:\n\n**This slightly unsteady, handheld shot begins at eye level with a low angle, looking up at a kite in the sky. The camera then tilts downward and pans from right to left, shifting attention to a little girl on the road. This movement changes the perspective to a high angle looking down at the girl. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the subject in focus while the background remains soft.**",
