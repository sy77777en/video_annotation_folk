    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, representing the player's perspective, first trucks right with a quick, brief pan to the right. After bypassing the building, it swiftly pans left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions precisely, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and concise.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is perfectly accurate in every detail.\n\n*   **\"smooth, eye-level first-person perspective\"**: This is spot on. The camera movement is incredibly stable (implying a gimbal or digital stabilization), the height is consistent with a person walking, and the view is clearly from a character's point of view.\n*   **\"maintains a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is pointed straight ahead, and the horizon remains parallel to the frame throughout.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: Correct. The foreground pillar, the midground walls, and the background at the end of the hall are all in sharp focus. There is no shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera first trucks right while briefly panning in the same direction\"**: This is a sophisticated and accurate observation. The camera doesn't just slide sideways; it also rotates slightly to keep the direction of \"gaze\" aligned with the movement, which is a natural human motion.\n*   **\"to move past a pillar\"**: Correctly identifies the purpose of the initial movement.\n*   **\"It then swiftly pans left to look down a dark pathway\"**: Correct. The movement is a pure rotation (pan) to the left, it is noticeably faster than the initial trucking motion, and its purpose is to reorient the view.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption successfully includes all the required information without adding unnecessary details.\n\n*   **Video/Camera Configuration**: It covers all the relevant points from the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle**: \"eye-level,\" \"level angle.\"\n    *   **Focus**: \"deep focus.\"\n    *   **Movements**: It details the type (trucking, panning), direction (right, left), steadiness (smooth), speed (swiftly), complexity (a combined truck/pan followed by a pan), and purpose (to move past an obstacle and look down a path).\n*   **Omission of Negatives**: As per the instructions, the caption correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed**: It's regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is none.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The angle is level.\n*   **Shot Transitions**: Since the video is a single, continuous shot, there are no transitions to describe, and the caption correctly avoids mentioning them.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a large amount of technical information into two clear, easy-to-read sentences.\n*   **Correct Terminology**: It uses the precise vocabulary requested in the instructions (trucks, pans, deep focus, eye-level, level angle).\n*   **Logical Structure**: The description is structured chronologically. It first establishes the static properties of the shot (perspective, angle, focus) and then describes the sequence of movements as they occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is exemplary. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of both the video content and the detailed requirements of the prompt. It is difficult to improve upon this description while adhering to the given constraints.",
