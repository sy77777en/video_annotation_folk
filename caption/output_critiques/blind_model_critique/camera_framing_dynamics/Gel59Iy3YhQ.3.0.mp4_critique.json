    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera presents a first-person perspective as it moves downhill in the game, advancing forward while descending. Midway, it slightly trucks to the right and concludes with a subtle tilt upward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of the Caption**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, comprehensive yet concise, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### **Detailed Breakdown**\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **\"slightly unsteady, first-person shot\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera has the natural bob and sway of a person walking, making it \"slightly unsteady\" but not distractingly shaky. The perspective is clearly from the operator's point of view, making \"first-person\" correct.\n    *   **\"eye-level, level angle\"**: Both are accurate. The camera is held at a height consistent with a person's head (\"eye-level\"), and it is pointed straight ahead, parallel to the ground (\"level angle\") for the majority of the shot.\n    *   **\"moves forward and downhill, briefly trucking to the right\"**: This correctly identifies the primary camera movement (dollying forward down a slope) and the subtle sideways shift (\"trucking right\") as the person navigates the path.\n    *   **\"tilting subtly upward at the end\"**: This accurately captures the final camera movement where the operator looks up towards the trees and sky.\n    *   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp\"**: This is a precise description of the focus. Both the foreground grass and the distant mountains are in sharp focus, which defines \"deep focus.\"\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption successfully avoids mentioning aspects that are not present or are standard, as instructed. It correctly omits any mention of video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (which is negligible), or a Dutch angle (which is absent).\n    *   **Required Elements:** The caption effectively covers all the relevant points requested in the instructions:\n        *   **Steadiness:** \"slightly unsteady\"\n        *   **Height & Angle:** \"eye-level, level angle\"\n        *   **Movements:** It details the translation (\"forward,\" \"downhill,\" \"trucking to the right\") and rotation (\"tilting subtly upward\") in the correct temporal order.\n        *   **Focus:** \"deep focus\"\n    *   **Terminology:** The caption uses the correct technical terms (\"trucking,\" \"tilting,\" \"deep focus\") precisely as intended by the instructions.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is an exemplary model of what was requested. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the video's technical and compositional elements and communicates them clearly and efficiently, following every rule laid out in the instructions.",
