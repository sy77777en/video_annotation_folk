    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written caption that perfectly aligns with the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres to all the specified guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects:\n\n*   **\"Slightly unsteady\"**: This is a precise description. The camera is not on a perfectly smooth gimbal or dolly, and the subtle up-and-down and side-to-side motion is characteristic of a handheld shot while walking.\n*   **\"Eye-level shot\"**: Correct. The perspective is consistent with a person of average height holding a camera and looking forward.\n*   **\"Mild barrel distortion\"**: This is an excellent and accurate observation. The vertical lines of the buildings on the left and right edges of the frame curve slightly outwards, which is a classic sign of mild barrel distortion, common in wider-angle lenses.\n*   **\"Camera moves forward\"**: This accurately describes the primary camera movement.\n*   **\"Deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp\"**: This is perfectly correct. The cobblestones in the immediate foreground, the midground buildings, and the distant background are all in sharp focus, indicating a large depth of field (deep focus).\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not applicable.\n\n*   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed. As per the instructions, this does not need to be mentioned, and the caption correctly omits it.\n*   **Lens Distortion**: It is present and correctly identified as \"mild barrel distortion.\"\n*   **Camera Angle & Height**: \"Eye-level\" is stated. The angle is a level angle, which is implied and doesn't need explicit mention for conciseness. There is no Dutch angle, so it is correctly omitted.\n*   **Movements**: The caption covers the key aspects of movement:\n    *   **Type/Direction**: \"moves forward\" (a translation/dolly).\n    *   **Steadiness**: \"slightly unsteady.\"\n    *   **Purpose**: \"creating the effect of walking along a wet, stone-paved waterfront.\"\n    *   It correctly omits other movements like panning, tilting, or zooming, as they are not present.\n*   **Focus**: \"Deep focus\" is clearly stated. Since there are no focus changes (like a rack focus), this is a complete description.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful adherence to the spirit and letter of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness**: The description is packed into a single, elegant sentence. It is informative without being verbose.\n*   **Clarity**: It uses clear, descriptive language (\"keeps the entire scene sharp\") to explain a technical term (\"deep focus\"), making it understandable to a broader audience.\n*   **Omission of Negatives**: It follows the rule of not mentioning attributes that are standard or absent (e.g., regular speed, no Dutch angle, no shot transitions), which contributes to its conciseness.\n*   **Descriptive Purpose**: It goes beyond a dry technical list by including the *purpose* or *effect* of the camera work (\"creating the effect of walking...\"), which adds valuable context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, covers all necessary points, remains concise, and is written in a clear and descriptive manner. There are no corrections or improvements needed.",
