    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the character in a line game from a side view, primarily trucking right with slight upward and downward movements to follow the character sliding along the line.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera movement as a smooth rightward track following a character, it lacks the specific technical detail and nuance required by the instructions. The description of a \"side view\" is too general; a more precise caption would specify if it's a `level angle` at the character's height or a `high angle` looking slightly down. The caption completely omits any mention of focus, which is a critical stylistic element; for instance, the video might use a `shallow depth of field` to blur the background and make the character and the line pop, a detail that is currently missing. The phrase \"upward and downward movements\" could be more professionally termed as `pedestaling`. Furthermore, the caption fails to account for more complex camera behaviors that are likely present. For example, as the character navigates a large loop or a high jump, the camera might `zoom out` to keep the entire action in frame before zooming back in, or it might `arc` slightly to add a sense of three-dimensionality. The description also neglects video speed; a key moment, like a near-crash or a successful trick, might be emphasized with `slow-motion`, which is a crucial piece of information. Finally, the caption assumes a single continuous shot, whereas the video could `hard cut` to a static close-up of the character at the finish line, requiring a separate description for the second shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera smoothly tracks the character from a level angle at the character's height, primarily trucking to the right. It employs pedestaling movements to follow the character as it slides along the drawn line. The video uses a shallow depth of field to blur the background, making the character and line stand out. As the character navigates large loops or high jumps, the camera zooms out to capture the entire action, then zooms back in, occasionally arcing to add a sense of three-dimensionality. Key moments, such as near-crashes or successful tricks, are highlighted with slow-motion effects. The video concludes with a hard cut to a static close-up of the character at the finish line.",
