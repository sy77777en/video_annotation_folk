    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the background.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. It contains several major inaccuracies and omits key details required by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Caption Feedback\n\n**Provided Caption:** \"The video is shot at a hip-level height with a level angle. It features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the background. The camera remains completely static throughout.\"\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is largely inaccurate.\n\n*   **Camera Height:** **Correct.** The camera is positioned around the waist or hip area, so \"hip-level height\" is an accurate description.\n*   **Camera Angle:** **Incorrect.** The caption states it's a \"level angle,\" but the camera is clearly pointing downwards at the subject's feet. This is a **high angle** shot. A level angle would be looking straight ahead, parallel to the ground.\n*   **Focus:** **Incorrect.** The caption claims the focus is on the \"background,\" which is the exact opposite of what is shown. The video has a shallow depth of field where the **foreground** (the person's shoes and the pavement directly around them) is in sharp focus, and the background is heavily blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** **Incorrect.** This is the most significant error. The caption claims the camera is \"completely static,\" but it is clearly moving forward, following the person as they walk.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and fails to describe several key elements mandated by the instructions.\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** Because it incorrectly identifies the shot as static, it completely omits the required description of the camera's movement. It fails to mention:\n    *   **Type:** The camera is **dollying forward** or **tracking forward**.\n    *   **Steadiness:** The shot is **handheld**, evidenced by the natural, rhythmic sway and bobbing motion that matches the person's gait.\n    *   **Purpose:** The movement's purpose is to follow the subject and create a point-of-view or over-the-shoulder perspective of the act of walking.\n*   **Focus:** The caption mentions shallow depth of field but fails to describe the dynamic nature of the focus. The focus is not static; it is **focus tracking**, as it continuously follows the feet to keep them sharp as they move forward.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the core requirements of the instructions.\n\n*   It does not provide an \"informative description\" because most of the information is wrong.\n*   It fails to describe the camera's movements (translation, steadiness, speed, purpose) as explicitly requested for non-static shots.\n*   It fails to accurately describe the focus plane (\"foreground\") and does not mention the dynamic focus change (\"focus tracking\").\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately follows your instructions:\n\n\"Shot from a **hip-level height** at a **high angle**, the **handheld camera dollies forward** to follow a person's walking feet. The video uses a **shallow depth of field**, with the **focus tracking the foreground** (the shoes and pavement) to keep it sharp while the background remains blurred. The camera movement is moderately steady, with a natural, rhythmic sway that matches the subject's walking pace.\"",
