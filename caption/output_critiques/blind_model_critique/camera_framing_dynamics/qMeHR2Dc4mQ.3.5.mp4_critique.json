    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera gradually zooms in, focusing on the man's face.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The video features a level camera angle with an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man's face in the foreground. The camera smoothly and slowly zooms in on the man's face, maintaining steadiness throughout.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete and potentially inaccurate** in one critical area. It successfully follows some instructions but misses key details required for a comprehensive description.\n\n#### Accuracy:\n*   **Potentially Inaccurate:** The most significant issue is the use of the term \"**zooms in**.\" The instructions specifically differentiate between **zooming** (changing the lens's focal length) and **dollying** (physically moving the camera forward).\n    *   A **zoom** would cause the background to appear to compress and flatten.\n    *   A **dolly** would maintain a consistent perspective, with background elements moving past the subject more naturally.\n    *   Without seeing the video, it's impossible to be certain, but a slow, smooth move toward a subject's face is often a dolly-in for a more intimate, less distorted effect. The caption's accuracy depends entirely on whether the focal length is changing or the camera itself is moving. A high-quality caption must make this distinction.\n\n#### Completeness:\n*   **Missing `Camera Height`:** The caption correctly identifies the `camera angle` as \"level\" but fails to specify the `camera height` (e.g., eye-level, shoulder-level). \"Level angle\" and \"eye-level height\" are related but distinct concepts, and the instructions ask for both.\n*   **Missing `Focus Change` Description:** While it mentions the focus is on the man's face, it doesn't describe *how* the focus is maintained during the movement. If the camera moves or zooms, the focus must be adjusted to keep the subject sharp. This would be described as **focus tracking**, which is a dynamic change the instructions ask to be noted.\n*   **Missing `Purpose` of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement. While it's implied (to emphasize the man), explicitly stating that the zoom/dolly serves to heighten intimacy or focus on the subject's expression would make the description more informative.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Good Adherence (Conciseness):** The caption correctly omits details about video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, assuming they are standard/absent. This follows the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Good Adherence (Core Elements):** It successfully describes the camera angle, depth of field, focus plane, and the steadiness/speed of the movement.\n*   **Poor Adherence (Movement Specificity):** It fails to adhere to the instruction's detailed list of movements by not distinguishing between a **zoom** and a **dolly**. This is a critical failure given the specificity requested.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption:\n\nHere are two improved versions, one assuming it's a zoom and the other a dolly, incorporating the missing elements:\n\n**Improved Caption (If it's a Dolly):**\n> The shot is captured from a steady, **eye-level height** at a level angle. It features an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus plane locked on the man's face in the foreground. The camera **slowly and smoothly dollies in**, moving closer to the man to create a more intimate framing, while **tracking focus** to keep his features perfectly sharp.\n\n**Improved Caption (If it's a Zoom):**\n> The shot is captured from a steady, **eye-level height** at a level angle. It features an extremely shallow depth of field, with the focus plane on the man's face in the foreground. The camera **slowly and smoothly zooms in**, tightening the frame on the man's face to emphasize his expression.",
