    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans right and slightly tilts up to reveal the entire weapon, then moves forward to approach it.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and serves as a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete in all the necessary details, and perfectly concise.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n**1. Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its description.\n*   **\"high-angle view\"**: This correctly identifies the camera's vertical position relative to the subject.\n*   **\"deep focus\"**: This accurately describes the depth of field, where elements in both the foreground and background are sharp.\n*   **\"smoothly pans right and slightly tilts up\"**: This precisely describes the initial camera rotation, including its direction (right, up), steadiness (smoothly), and magnitude (slightly).\n*   **\"to reveal the entire weapon\"**: This correctly identifies the **purpose** of the camera movement, which is a key part of the instructions.\n*   **\"then moves forward to approach it\"**: This accurately describes the subsequent camera translation (a dolly-in) and its sequence in the shot.\n\n**2. Completeness:** The caption includes all the relevant, non-standard information required by the instructions.\n*   **Camera Angle & Focus**: It correctly specifies the `high angle` and `deep focus`.\n*   **Camera Movement**: It provides a comprehensive description of the movement, covering:\n    *   **Type**: Pan, Tilt, and forward translation (dolly).\n    *   **Direction**: Right, up, and forward.\n    *   **Steadiness**: \"Smoothly.\"\n    *   **Complexity & Sequence**: It correctly identifies the initial combined movement (`pans right and slightly tilts up`) and the subsequent movement (`then moves forward`).\n    *   **Purpose**: It includes the reason for the movement (`to reveal the entire weapon`).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions (Conciseness):** The caption excels at being concise by omitting unnecessary information, as instructed.\n*   It correctly leaves out mentions of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, and **Dutch angle**, assuming they are all standard/absent. This avoids clutter.\n*   It combines the pan and tilt into a single descriptive phrase, reflecting that they happen concurrently, which is more efficient than listing them separately.\n*   The entire description is delivered in a single, clear, and easy-to-read sentence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a perfect execution of the instructions. It is technically precise, covers all the specified dynamic elements (angle, focus, movement), and demonstrates an excellent understanding of conciseness by including only what is necessary to create an informative and accurate description.",
