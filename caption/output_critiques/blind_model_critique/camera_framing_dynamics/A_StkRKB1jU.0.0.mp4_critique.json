    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good and provides an accurate, high-level summary of the video. However, it could be improved by incorporating more specific terminology and detail as requested by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description:\n*   **\"The camera is at an aerial level...\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned high above the ground, consistent with a drone or a high vehicle mount, giving an aerial perspective of the landscape.\n*   **\"...moving forward smoothly with minimal shaking.\"**: Correct. The camera executes a very stable forward dolly shot with excellent stabilization, resulting in smooth movement with almost no perceptible shaking.\n*   **\"It maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead...\"**: Correct. The camera is pointed directly forward, parallel to the ground, with the horizon line centered.\n*   **\"...and uses deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**: Correct. The entire scene, from the ice in the immediate foreground to the clouds on the distant horizon, is in sharp focus.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is concise but misses a few details that would make it more comprehensive according to the instructions:\n*   **Movement Terminology**: While \"moving forward\" is correct, the instructions encourage more specific terms. This movement is a **dolly-in**.\n*   **Movement Speed**: The instructions ask for the speed of the movement. The caption doesn't specify it. A more complete description would note that the camera moves forward **at a moderate and constant speed**.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres well to the core principles of the instructions but could be more precise:\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption is very concise, as requested.\n*   **Omission of Unnecessary Information**: It correctly omits any mention of video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (none is visible), or Dutch angle (the horizon is level). This shows a good understanding of the instruction to only mention non-standard elements.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It uses correct general terms (\"aerial level,\" \"deep focus\") but could be enhanced by using the more technical term \"dolly-in\" for the forward movement.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\nHere is an example of a caption that incorporates the suggested improvements while remaining concise:\n\n\"From an aerial level, the camera performs a smooth **dolly-in** at a moderate speed, maintaining a level angle. The shot uses deep focus, keeping the entire icy landscape and sky sharp.\"",
