    "pre_caption": "This is a stop-motion video filmed from a static, high-angle, overhead perspective. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the characters in the midground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it describes:\n*   **\"This is a stop-motion video...\"**: Correct. The video is clearly an animation created by capturing individual frames of physically manipulated objects (the LEGO-style figures), which is the definition of stop-motion.\n*   **\"...filmed from a static...\"**: Correct. The camera's position and framing do not change at all throughout the video.\n*   **\"...high-angle, overhead perspective.\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned significantly above the subjects, looking down on the action. This qualifies as both a high angle and an overhead perspective.\n*   **\"The camera maintains a shallow depth of field...\"**: Correct. The figures are in sharp focus, while the white background behind them is softly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field that isolates the subjects.\n*   **\"...with the focus set on the characters in the midground.\"**: Correct. The plane of sharpest focus is on the two figures, which are positioned in the midground of the scene.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is complete because it includes all the relevant information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n*   It correctly identifies the **video speed** alteration as `stop-motion`.\n*   It describes the **camera angle** (`high-angle`), **height** (`overhead perspective`), and **steadiness** (`static`).\n*   It accurately details the **focus** (`shallow depth of field`) and the **focus plane** (`midground`).\n*   Crucially, it follows the instruction: \"If the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\" The caption correctly omits any mention of lens distortion, Dutch angles, camera movement, or focus changes because none are present in the video. This makes the description both complete and concise.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption perfectly follows the spirit and letter of the instructions:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption is extremely efficient. In just two sentences, it conveys all the essential technical and stylistic information about the shot's configuration.\n*   **Use of Correct Terminology:** It uses the specific terms requested in the instructions, such as `stop-motion`, `static`, `high-angle`, `shallow depth of field`, and `midground`.\n*   **Logical Structure:** It logically groups the camera's physical setup (speed, position, angle) in the first sentence and the optical properties (focus, depth of field) in the second, making it easy to read and understand.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what the instructions asked for. It is precise, thorough in covering the relevant aspects, and commendably concise by leaving out unnecessary details.",
