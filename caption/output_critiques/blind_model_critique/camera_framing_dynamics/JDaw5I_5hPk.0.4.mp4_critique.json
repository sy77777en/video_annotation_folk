    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting down and panning right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while panning and tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions by being both concise and technically descriptive.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n**1. Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **Steadiness:** \"Slightly unsteady\" correctly identifies the minor, natural hand-held shake.\n*   **Camera Height:** \"Above-water shot\" is a precise and accurate description of the camera's position relative to the environment.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"Shallow depth of field that keeps a seagull in focus\" is spot-on. The seagull is sharp while the background is clearly blurred, and the focus successfully follows the subject.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is perfect. It correctly identifies the overall purpose (\"tracks the bird\") and then breaks it down into the specific component movements (\"tilting down and panning to the right\").\n*   **Camera Angle:** The analysis of the angle change from \"a level to a high angle\" is a sophisticated and correct observation. The camera is level with the bird in the air but looks down on it (high angle) once it has landed.\n\n**2. Completeness:** The caption is complete and follows the rule of omission for standard features.\n\n*   It successfully covers all the relevant, non-standard aspects of the shot: steadiness, height, focus, DoF, movement, and angle change.\n*   As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or **Dutch angle**, as the video is at regular speed, has no noticeable distortion, and maintains a level horizon.\n*   Since the video consists of a single, continuous shot, there is no need to describe shot transitions, and the caption correctly avoids this.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:** The caption demonstrates a full understanding of the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into a single, easy-to-read sentence without being verbose.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions (e.g., `tracks`, `tilting`, `panning`, `shallow depth of field`, `level angle`, `high angle`).\n*   **Logical Structure:** The caption is structured logically, starting with the overall shot characteristics (steadiness, height, focus) and then detailing the camera's dynamic actions (movement and resulting angle change).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is a professional, accurate, and comprehensive description of the camera's configuration and movement.",
