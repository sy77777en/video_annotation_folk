    "pre_caption": "This is a slow-motion video. The camera is stationary, positioned at an eye-level and level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus maintained on the man in the foreground. Due to the lack of background cues, the exact camera motion cannot be determined.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The exact camera motion cannot be determined due to the lack of background cues.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera is stationary.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **not good**. While it correctly identifies some basic aspects like video speed and depth of field, it makes a critical error in describing the camera movement and then incorrectly justifies that error. It fails to provide a complete and accurate description as required by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"This is a slow-motion video.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The action of the man jumping is clearly slowed down.\n\n*   **\"The camera is stationary...\"**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This is the most significant error. The camera is actively moving to keep the subject centered in the frame. As the man jumps upwards and slightly to the right, the camera **pedestals up** (moves vertically) and **trucks right** (moves horizontally) to track him. A stationary camera would have resulted in the man moving up and out of the frame.\n\n*   **\"...positioned at an eye-level and level angle.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The camera is positioned straight-on at approximately the subject's head/chest height.\n\n*   **\"It employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus maintained on the man in the foreground.\"**\n    *   **Correct.** The subject is in sharp focus while the background is completely blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field. The focus does remain on the man.\n\n*   **\"Due to the lack of background cues, the exact camera motion cannot be determined.\"**\n    *   **Incorrect.** This statement is a false conclusion. While the lack of a detailed background makes it impossible to detect dollying (forward/backward movement), the camera's tracking movement (pedestaling and trucking) is clearly evident by observing the subject's consistent position within the frame. The camera's movement is what keeps him centered.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption fails to describe the **camera movement**, which is a key component of the shot and a primary requirement of the instructions. It misses the opportunity to identify the **pedestal up**, **trucking right**, and the overall purpose of the movement, which is **tracking**.\n*   While it mentions focus is \"maintained,\" it doesn't use the more precise term **\"focus tracking\"** from the instructions, which would have been more complete.\n*   It correctly omits details about lens distortion and Dutch angle, as they are not present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption fails to follow the core instruction to \"provide a concise yet informative description of the... **movements (translation, rotation... tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose)**.\" By incorrectly labeling the camera as \"stationary,\" it completely misses this crucial section.\n*   It follows the instructions for describing **video speed**, **camera angle/height**, and **focus/depth of field** reasonably well, but the major error regarding movement undermines its overall quality.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the given instructions:\n\n**\"This slow-motion video is captured from an eye-level, level angle. The camera smoothly pedestals up and trucks slightly right to track the man as he jumps. A shallow depth of field is used, with focus tracking the foreground subject, leaving the background completely blurred.\"**",
