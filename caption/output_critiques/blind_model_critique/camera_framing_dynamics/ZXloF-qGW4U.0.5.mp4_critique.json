    "pre_caption": "This eye-level shot begins at a high angle, looking down at a robotic figure. The camera then performs a smooth upward tilt, which brings the view to a level angle. A shallow depth of field is maintained throughout, keeping the focus on the figure in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the upward tilt and shallow depth of field, it contains a few inaccuracies and omissions based on the visual information. The description of an \"eye-level shot\" that \"begins at a high angle\" is contradictory; the camera is positioned at a fixed chest-level height throughout, initially tilting down to create a high angle on the crouched robot, then tilting up to a level angle as the robot stands. More significantly, the caption completely misses a slow, subtle dolly-in that occurs simultaneously with the tilt. This forward movement is crucial as it gradually tightens the frame, moving from a medium shot to a close-up on the robot's face, thereby enhancing the feeling of intimacy and revealing the intricate details of its glowing optical sensors. The purpose of the tilt is also not just to change the angle, but to motivationally follow the robot's action of rising, a key narrative beat that is absent from the description. Finally, while the focus is indeed on the foreground figure, it could be more precisely described as a focus tracking shot, as it perfectly maintains sharpness on the robot's head even as the camera and subject both move.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera is positioned at a fixed chest-level height, initially tilting down to create a high angle on the crouched robotic figure. As the robot stands, the camera smoothly tilts upward to a level angle, following the robot's movement and highlighting this key narrative moment. Simultaneously, a slow, subtle dolly-in occurs, gradually tightening the frame from a medium shot to a close-up on the robot's face. This forward movement enhances the feeling of intimacy and reveals the intricate details of its glowing optical sensors. Throughout the shot, a focus tracking technique is employed, maintaining sharpness on the robot's head as both the camera and subject move, with a shallow depth of field keeping the focus on the figure in the foreground.",
