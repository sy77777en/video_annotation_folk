    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is partially good but contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera angle and depth of field.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level\" is accurate. It appears to be a handheld shot from a standing person's perspective.\n    *   **Camera Movement/Steadiness:** \"The camera remains fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness without intentional movement\" is an excellent and precise description. It correctly identifies the shot as static in intent while acknowledging the natural micro-movements of a handheld camera.\n    *   **Subject of Focus:** \"focusing on the goats in the grass\" is correct.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption states a \"level angle,\" which is inaccurate. The camera is clearly tilted downwards to frame the goats on the ground. The correct term would be a **slight high angle**.\n    *   **Focus (Depth of Field):** The claim of \"deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene\" is incorrect. In a deep focus shot, the foreground, midground, and background would all be sharp. In this video, the background (the fence and trees) is noticeably softer and more out of focus than the goats in the midground. This is a **medium or shallow depth of field**, not a deep one.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details about normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n*   It successfully covers height, movement, and focus, which are the most relevant aspects of this particular shot.\n*   However, its failure to accurately describe the angle and depth of field means it does not fully meet the instruction's requirement for an \"informative description.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good at identifying the camera's height and its static, handheld nature. However, it fails on two key technical descriptors: **angle** and **depth of field**. The mischaracterization of the shot as having \"deep focus\" is a significant error.\n\nA more accurate and improved caption would be:\n\n**\"From an eye-level height, the camera uses a slight high angle to focus on the goats in the midground. The shot has a medium depth of field, rendering the background slightly out of focus. The camera is static, with only minor unsteadiness characteristic of a handheld shot.\"**",
