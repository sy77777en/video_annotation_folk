    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, capturing a foot walking forward. The camera is positioned at ground level with a high angle, looking down. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground. The camera tracks the foot from the front, initially moving backward and slightly forward as the foot steps back. The movement is slow and slightly unsteady, with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks a foot walking forward from the front, initially moving backward. At the end of the video, it slightly moves forward as the foot steps backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key aspects of the video, such as the slow motion, shallow depth of field, and unsteady movement. However, it contains a significant error in describing the camera angle and could be more precise with its terminology for camera movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption is correct about the **video speed** (*slow motion*), **camera height** (*ground level*), **focus** (*shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground*), and **camera steadiness** (*slow and slightly unsteady, with some shaking*).\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:** The most significant error is describing the camera angle as a **\"high angle, looking down.\"** This is incorrect. The camera is positioned below the subject's knee and is pointing **upward** at the foot. This is a classic **low angle** shot. A high angle would involve the camera being placed above the subject and looking down.\n*   **Slightly Inaccurate/Confusing:** The description of the movement (\"initially moving backward and slightly forward as the foot steps back\") is a bit convoluted. While it correctly identifies the primary backward motion, the \"slightly forward\" part is more a result of the general unsteadiness rather than a deliberate, separate movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Good:** The caption is quite complete according to the instructions. It successfully covers the most prominent features of the shot: speed, height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   **Excellent Omission:** It correctly follows the instruction to be concise by not mentioning the absence of lens distortion, Dutch angles, or complex transitions, as none are present.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption uses specific terminology requested in the instructions, such as *slow motion*, *ground level*, and *shallow depth of field*. It attempts to describe all the required elements.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The primary failure in adherence is the incorrect application of the term *high angle*. The instructions clearly differentiate between high, low, and level angles, and the caption misidentifies this fundamental aspect. Additionally, while \"tracks\" is used, a more precise term from the instructions, like **\"dollying backward\"** (since the entire camera is moving), would be even better.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the errors and uses more precise terminology, fully adhering to your instructions:\n\n**This slow-motion shot is captured from a ground-level, low-angle perspective. Using a shallow depth of field, the focus is locked on the walking foot in the midground. The camera tracks the subject by dollying backward at a slow pace, exhibiting slight unsteadiness and shaking.**",
