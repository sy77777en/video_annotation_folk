    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, capturing the slicing of cucumbers on a cutting board. The camera is positioned at eye level with a high angle, looking down at the scene. It employs deep focus, ensuring all elements, including the cucumbers and surrounding vegetables, remain sharp. The camera is static, with no movement or shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is at eye level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and is partially accurate, but it contains one major error and one point of imprecision that misrepresent the visual information in the video. While it adheres to the conciseness and structural guidelines, the factual inaccuracies make it a poor description.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"The video is in slow motion, capturing the slicing of cucumbers on a cutting board.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** **Correct.** The movement of the knife and the falling cucumber slices are clearly much slower than in real life.\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level with a high angle, looking down at the scene.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** **Partially Correct, but Imprecise.**\n        *   **High Angle:** This is **correct**. The camera is clearly angled downwards towards the subject.\n        *   **Eye-level:** This is **inaccurate and misleading**. \"Eye-level\" suggests the camera is at the height of a person's eyes. In this context, it would imply a person standing over the cutting board, creating a very steep angle. A more accurate term from your instructions would be **overhead-level**, as the camera is positioned directly above the action, not at the height of a person standing nearby.\n\n*   **\"It employs deep focus, ensuring all elements, including the cucumbers and surrounding vegetables, remain sharp.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** **Incorrect.** This is the most significant error in the caption.\n        *   The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**. The focus plane is fixed on the **midground**, where the knife is actively slicing the cucumber.\n        *   The cucumbers in the **background** (at the top of the frame) are visibly out of focus and blurry. The immediate **foreground** (the very bottom edge of the cutting board) is also slightly soft. \"Deep focus\" would mean that both the background and foreground elements are sharp, which is not the case here.\n\n*   **\"The camera is static, with no movement or shaking.\"**\n    *   **Accuracy:** **Correct.** The frame is completely fixed throughout the video. There is no panning, tilting, dollying, or shaking.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the required elements: **video speed, camera angle, camera height, focus, and movement.**\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as lens distortion, Dutch angles, or shot transitions, as per the instructions.\n*   The main issue with completeness is not that it missed a category, but that the information provided for the **focus** and **camera height** categories was incorrect.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and to the point. **Good adherence.**\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology (e.g., \"slow motion,\" \"high angle,\" \"static\"). However, it misapplies the term \"deep focus.\" **Partial adherence.**\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** It correctly avoids stating \"no lens distortion\" or \"regular speed,\" which follows the instructions well. **Good adherence.**\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately reflects the video according to your instructions:\n\n**The video is in slow motion, filmed from an overhead-level, high angle. It uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus plane on the midground where the cucumber is being sliced, leaving the background elements out of focus. The camera is static.**",
