    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is difficult to identify in this animated video. \n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **accurate but incomplete**. It correctly identifies the most obvious characteristics of the shot (static, 2D animation) but fails to address several key parameters required by the detailed instructions, such as camera angle, video speed/style, and focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n*   **\"This is a static shot...\"**: **Correct.** The camera does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom in any way. The framing is completely fixed.\n*   **\"...of a 2D animation.\"**: **Correct.** This is a crucial observation, as it explains why concepts like lens distortion and realistic depth of field do not apply.\n*   **\"The camera height is difficult to identify...\"**: **Correct.** The abstract grid background provides no real-world reference points (like a floor or horizon), making it impossible to determine a specific height (e.g., eye-level, ground-level).\n\nThe statements made in the caption are all factually correct.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\nThis is the main area where the caption falls short. It omits several required descriptive elements.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption misses this. The video is not live-action played at regular speed; it's an animation with a distinct, non-fluid movement style. The instructions specifically mention noting **stop-motion**, which is an excellent descriptor for this frame-by-frame animation style.\n*   **Camera Angle:** The caption does not mention the angle. The shot is filmed directly from the side, making it a clear **level angle**.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption omits this. According to the instructions, if a video lacks realistic depth of field, this should be described. In this 2D animation, there is no depth of field whatsoever; every element is perfectly and equally sharp. This should be mentioned.\n*   **Lens Distortion / Dutch Angle:** The caption correctly omits these, as they are not present. This adheres to the instruction for conciseness.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be **concise** and to state that the shot is **static**.\n*   It correctly identifies that some parameters (like height) are indeterminate, which is a valid observation.\n*   However, it fails to provide the \"informative description\" of the other required elements (angle, focus, animation style/speed), making it an incomplete execution of the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more fully adheres to your instructions:\n\n**\"This is a static, level-angle shot of a 2D stop-motion style animation. Due to the animated nature of the video, there is no depth of field, and all elements remain in sharp focus. The camera height is indeterminate against the abstract grid background.\"**\n\n### Why the Revised Caption is Better\n\n*   **Completeness:** It includes the **camera angle** (level-angle) and the **video style** (stop-motion style animation), which were missing.\n*   **Informativeness:** It addresses **focus** by explaining the lack of depth of field, as required by the instructions for artificial or non-realistic videos.\n*   **Clarity:** It retains the accuracy of the original caption regarding the static nature of the shot and the indeterminate height.\n*   **Conciseness:** It combines all the necessary information into a single, flowing description without being overly wordy.",
