    "pre_caption": "This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a deep focus to keep the entire scene sharp. The camera performs a smooth, counterclockwise arc around a bright, glowing device in the center. As the camera zooms out, it reveals that the video is a screen recording, with computer screen borders appearing at the edges.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera arcs counterclockwise around a glowing device at the frame's center. As it zooms out, borders appear at the edges, revealing the video as a screen recording on a computer screen.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core movement and the screen-recording reveal, it oversimplifies the transition and misses key details about the dual-camera perspectives. The description of the initial shot as \"eye-level, level-angle\" is accurate, but it fails to specify the final perspective on the computer screen; for instance, the final shot might be a perfectly flat, 2D digital capture rather than a physical camera shot, which is a crucial distinction. The phrase \"As the camera zooms out\" is misleading because it implies a single, continuous camera action. It would be more precise to describe this as a transition that reveals a second frame of reference, distinguishing between the virtual camera arcing within the 3D scene and the separate screen-capture effect that pulls back. Additionally, the caption notes the \"deep focus\" of the initial scene but doesn't contrast it with the final view, which likely has a completely flat, artificial sharpness characteristic of a screen recording, lacking any realistic depth of field. A more detailed caption would clarify that the initial arcing shot is a self-contained clip, and a zoom-out effect is then applied to this clip to reveal it playing within a software interface on a computer screen.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with an eye-level, level-angle shot using deep focus to keep the entire 3D scene sharp. The camera smoothly performs a counterclockwise arc around a bright, glowing device at the center. This initial arcing shot is a self-contained clip. A transition then occurs, revealing a second frame of reference: the scene is actually a screen recording. The camera effect shifts to a flat, 2D digital capture, characteristic of a screen recording, with computer screen borders appearing at the edges. This transition distinguishes between the virtual camera movement within the 3D scene and the separate screen-capture effect that pulls back to show the clip playing within a software interface on a computer screen.",
