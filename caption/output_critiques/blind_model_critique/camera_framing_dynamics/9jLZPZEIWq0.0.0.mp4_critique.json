    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion video is captured from a smooth, hip-level perspective. The camera starts at a level angle and tilts upward, transitioning to a low angle. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus sharp on the woman in the foreground while blurring the building behind her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the slow-motion, low angle, and shallow depth of field, it misses several key dynamic elements that define the shot. The description of the camera movement is too simplistic; it's not just a smooth upward tilt but also a slow, simultaneous dolly-in, moving closer to the woman to intensify the focus on her expression as she looks up. The caption also fails to mention that the video employs a speed ramp, beginning at normal speed and then transitioning into slow-motion as the main action starts, which adds significant dramatic weight. Furthermore, the focus isn't static; the camera is actively focus tracking her face, keeping it perfectly sharp as she moves and the camera dollies in. Finally, the use of a wide-angle lens is apparent, creating slight barrel distortion on the vertical lines of the building in the background as the camera tilts, an important optical characteristic that the current caption omits.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This dynamic slow-motion video captures a smooth, hip-level perspective with a complex camera movement. It begins with a normal speed that transitions into slow-motion through a speed ramp, adding dramatic weight as the main action unfolds. The camera not only tilts upward but also performs a slow dolly-in, moving closer to the woman to intensify the focus on her expression as she looks up. A shallow depth of field keeps her face perfectly sharp through active focus tracking, while the building behind her blurs. The use of a wide-angle lens introduces slight barrel distortion on the building's vertical lines, enhancing the visual impact as the camera tilts.",
