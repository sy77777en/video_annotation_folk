    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption accurately and concisely describes the most important visual elements of the video according to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Video Speed:** The description of \"slow-motion\" is **correct**. The woman's movements and the flow of her dress are clearly slowed down.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** The description of a \"hip-level perspective\" that \"starts at a level angle and tilts upward, transitioning to a low angle\" is **perfectly accurate**. The camera begins by framing her torso and then tilts up to her face as she passes, creating a low-angle shot.\n*   **Movement:** The caption correctly identifies the \"upward tilt\" and accurately describes the overall movement as \"smooth.\"\n*   **Focus:** The description of a \"shallow depth of field\" that \"keeps the focus sharp on the woman in the foreground while blurring the building behind her\" is **spot-on**. The subject is isolated from the background through selective focus.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption does a great job of being concise while covering the key aspects requested.\n\n*   **What it got right:** It correctly identified and included the non-standard video speed, the camera height, the change in angle, the primary camera movement, and the depth of field. It also correctly omitted any mention of lens distortion or Dutch angles, as they are not present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n*   **Minor Omissions for a Perfect Score:** While the caption is excellent, a more exhaustive description based on the detailed instructions could have also mentioned:\n    *   **Panning:** In addition to tilting up, the camera also pans slightly to the right to follow the woman as she walks across the frame.\n    *   **Focus Tracking:** The focus actively tracks the woman to keep her sharp as she moves, which is a subtle but present dynamic change in focus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Yes, the caption is very good.** It is accurate, clear, and captures the essential cinematographic details of the shot. It successfully balances being informative with being concise, which is a key part of the instruction. The minor omissions (panning and focus tracking) do not detract from its overall quality and would only be necessary for an absolutely exhaustive technical breakdown. For its intended purpose, the caption is highly effective.",
