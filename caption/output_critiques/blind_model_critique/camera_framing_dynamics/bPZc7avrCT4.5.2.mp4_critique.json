    "pre_caption": "This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the drill and yellow balloon in the foreground. The video employs a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption correctly identifies all the key technical aspects of the video:\n*   **Movement:** It is a **static** shot, as the camera does not move.\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The framing is indeed **eye-level** with the action and uses a **level angle**.\n*   **Focus:** The use of a **shallow depth of field** is correctly noted, which effectively isolates the **drill and balloon in the foreground** by blurring the background.\n*   **Video Speed:** The description of a **speed ramp effect** is precise. The video transitions from fast-motion (as the drill approaches) to slow-motion (for the impact and pop), which is the definition of a speed ramp.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions without being verbose:\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It describes the camera's position (static, eye-level, level angle).\n*   **Video Configuration:** It clearly explains the video speed alteration (speed ramp).\n*   **Focus:** It details both the depth of field (shallow) and the focus plane (foreground).\n*   **Movements:** It correctly states the shot is static, which is the simplest form of movement description.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect understanding of the instructions' nuances:\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise and informative. It doesn't waste words on elements that are not present, such as lens distortion or a Dutch angle, just as the instructions advised.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the precise term **\"speed ramp\"** for the change in video speed and correctly identifies the **\"shallow depth of field.\"**\n*   **Clarity:** The description is easy to understand for both a technical and non-technical audience. It explains what the speed ramp does (\"shifting between fast and slow motion\"), making the technical term more accessible.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is a well-crafted, professional description that is both technically precise and easy to comprehend.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The camera employs a shallow depth of field to focus on the drill and yellow balloon in the foreground, effectively blurring the background. A speed ramp effect is used, transitioning smoothly between fast motion as the drill approaches and slow motion during the impact and pop.",
