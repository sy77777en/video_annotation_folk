    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** There isn’t enough background information to determine the camera’s motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera is stationary.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** \"This is a static shot with a stationary camera.\"\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe provided caption is **not good** because it is both inaccurate and incomplete, failing to adhere to the detailed requirements of the instructions.\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Poor\n\n*   The caption claims the shot is \"static\" with a \"stationary camera.\" This is incorrect. While there is no deliberate camera movement like panning or tilting, the frame is not perfectly still. There is a very subtle, continuous wobble or drift throughout the video, which suggests the camera was either handheld by someone trying to stay still or placed on an unstable surface. A more accurate description would be \"nearly static\" or \"a mostly stable shot with minimal wobble.\"\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Poor\n\n*   The caption is extremely incomplete and misses several key visual elements that the instructions explicitly ask to be described:\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** It fails to mention that this is a **high-angle** shot, positioned **above the subject** (the hands and laptop).\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** It completely omits one of the most prominent features of the shot: the **shallow depth of field**. The instructions specifically ask to describe the focus plane and depth. In this video, the focus is fixed on the **midground** (the hands and keyboard), leaving the background significantly blurred. This is a crucial piece of information that the caption ignores.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction: Very Poor\n\n*   The caption fails to follow the core directive, which is to provide a \"concise yet **informative** description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\" While the caption is concise, it is not informative.\n*   It ignores the specific prompts regarding **camera angle, camera height, and focus/depth of field**, all of which are clearly discernible in the video.\n*   The instruction to \"be concise\" means omitting details that are standard or absent (e.g., regular video speed, no lens distortion), not omitting the primary characteristics of the shot itself.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n\"This is a nearly static, high-angle shot with a shallow depth of field. The camera, positioned above the subject, exhibits minimal wobble. The focus is fixed on the midground, keeping the hands and laptop sharp while the background is heavily blurred.\"",
