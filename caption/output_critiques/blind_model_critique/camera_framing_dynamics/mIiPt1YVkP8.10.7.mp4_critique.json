    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera smoothly tracks the airplanes taking off from the side, moving rightward with a slight upward tilt.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption captures the basic action, it lacks the technical precision and detail required by the instructions. The description of the camera as being at an \"aerial, level angle\" is contradictory; an aerial shot implies a high position, which would create a \"high angle\" or \"bird's-eye view\" looking down on the runway. If the camera is flying alongside the planes at their altitude, it would be more accurately described as an \"eye-level\" shot relative to the subject, a significant and impressive technical feat worth noting. The caption also completely omits the video speed; for example, the takeoff might be presented in dramatic slow-motion, which is a critical piece of information. The description of movement is too general. Instead of just \"tracks... moving rightward,\" a more precise description would be \"trucks right, parallel to the runway.\" The \"slight upward tilt\" is likely accompanied by a \"pedestal up\" or \"crane up\" movement as the camera platform itself gains altitude to follow the planes, a key dynamic element that is missing. Lastly, while \"deep focus\" is noted, the caption could be more nuanced by mentioning if there is any subtle barrel distortion from a wide lens, which is common in aerial footage, or if the focus is actively tracking the planes to keep them sharp against the potentially softer background, rather than being statically deep.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera captures the scene from an aerial, eye-level perspective, flying alongside the airplanes at their altitude, showcasing a remarkable technical achievement. It smoothly trucks right, parallel to the runway, with a slight upward tilt and a pedestal up movement to maintain focus on the planes as they take off. The takeoff is presented in dramatic slow-motion, enhancing the visual impact. The deep focus keeps the planes sharp against a softer background, and there may be subtle barrel distortion from the wide lens, adding to the dynamic feel of the footage.",
