    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera starting at hip level and moving to ground level. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle, looking up. A varying Dutch angle is present due to camera rolling. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. It moves slowly downward while tilting up, focusing on the person in the Spider-Man costume. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video where playback speed is reduced, making actions appear slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving down and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is highly accurate, exceptionally complete, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **\"The video is in slow motion...\"**: Correct. The action of the person falling is clearly slowed down.\n*   **\"...with the camera starting at hip level and moving to ground level.\"**: Correct. The camera begins at the subject's waist and ends near the pavement.\n*   **\"Initially, the camera is at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle, looking up.\"**: Correct. The shot begins looking straight at the subject and transitions to an upward-facing low angle as the subject falls past the camera.\n*   **\"A varying Dutch angle is present due to camera rolling.\"**: This is a particularly strong and accurate observation. The horizon is tilted, and the degree of tilt changes throughout the shot. Correctly identifying this as \"camera rolling\" is precise.\n*   **\"The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**: Correct. The subject in the midground and the buildings in the background are both relatively sharp and in focus.\n*   **\"It moves slowly downward while tilting up...\"**: Correct. This perfectly describes the compound movement required to keep the subject framed while the camera descends.\n*   **\"...focusing on the person in the Spider-Man costume.\"**: Correct. This accurately states the purpose of the camera movement.\n*   **\"The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\"**: Correct. There is a minor, handheld-like wobble, which the caption correctly identifies as slight unsteadiness.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is remarkably complete, covering all the relevant points from the instructions while correctly omitting those that are not present.\n*   **Video Speed**: Covered (\"slow motion\").\n*   **Camera Height & Angle**: Covered, including the dynamic changes (\"starts at hip level and moving to ground level,\" \"shifts to a low angle\").\n*   **Movements**: Excellently covered. It describes the primary downward movement, the upward tilt, the roll (causing the Dutch angle), the speed (\"slowly\"), and the steadiness (\"slightly unsteady\").\n*   **Focus**: Covered (\"deep focus with a large depth of field\").\n*   **Omissions**: The caption correctly omits any mention of lens distortion, zooming, or shot transitions, as none are present. This demonstrates a good understanding of the instruction to be concise and only include relevant information.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption follows the provided instructions with a high degree of precision.\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical detail into a few clear sentences without any wasted words.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It uses correct and specific terms like \"slow motion,\" \"hip level,\" \"low angle,\" \"Dutch angle,\" \"camera rolling,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"tilting up.\"\n*   **Dynamic Changes**: It successfully describes how multiple parameters (height, angle, roll) change over the course of the single shot.\n*   **Movement Description**: It describes the movement's type, direction, speed, and steadiness as requested.\n\n### Potential Minor Improvement\nThe caption is already near-perfect. The only possible enhancement would be to use a more technical term for the downward movement, but this is a minor point as the current description is perfectly clear.\n\n*   **Suggestion**: To be even more technical, you could replace \"moves slowly downward\" with \"**pedestals slowly down**.\"\n\n**Revised Example (for maximum technicality):**\n\"The video is in slow motion. The camera **pedestals** from hip level to ground level, simultaneously **tilting up** to follow the subject. The shot begins at a level angle and shifts to a low angle. A varying Dutch angle is created by continuous **camera rolling**. The camera maintains deep focus, and the movement is slightly unsteady.\"\n\nEven without this change, the original caption is outstanding and fully meets the requirements of the prompt.",
