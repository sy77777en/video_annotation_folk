    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect fit for the video and an exemplary execution of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is outstanding. It is accurate, concise, and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of both the video's technical aspects and the specific requirements of the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video.\n\n*   **Camera Position:** `ground level with a level angle` is a precise and correct description. The camera is positioned very low, making the foreground leaves prominent, and it is aimed straight ahead, parallel to the ground.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** `deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp` is a perfect analysis. The leaves in the immediate foreground, the man and dog in the midground, and the trees in the background are all in sharp focus, which is the definition of a large depth of field.\n*   **Camera Movement:** `fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement` is the most nuanced and impressive part of the caption. It correctly identifies that the camera's composition is static (not panning, tilting, etc.) but also acknowledges the minor, unintentional shake, likely from being handheld or placed on an unstable surface. This is a critical distinction from a perfectly stable tripod shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what is not needed.\n\n*   **Included Elements:** It correctly identifies and describes the key non-standard features of the shot: the specific camera height (`ground-level`), the focus characteristics (`deep focus`), and the subtle nature of the camera's stability (`fixed but unsteady`).\n*   **Omitted Elements:** As per the instructions (\"*if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these*\"), the caption correctly omits:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot.\n\nBy including only the relevant details, the caption remains informative without being verbose.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption follows the provided instructions flawlessly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into three clear, well-structured sentences.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses the correct terminology requested by the instructions, such as `ground level`, `level angle`, and `deep focus`.\n*   **Movement Description:** It accurately describes the camera as \"fixed\" (no intentional movement like panning or tracking) while also noting its lack of perfect steadiness, which is a key aspect of the shot's feel.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically accurate, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly concise by omitting standard or absent features. No improvements are needed.",
