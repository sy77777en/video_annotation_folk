    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent exercise. The provided caption is **not good** because it contains several significant inaccuracies and misinterprets key visual elements of the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption fails to accurately describe the video's camera configuration. It incorrectly identifies the camera height, angle, depth of field, and the quality of the movement. While it correctly identifies the general direction of movement and the subject of focus, the core technical descriptions are wrong, making it a poor and misleading caption according to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is largely inaccurate. Here are the specific errors:\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level...\" -> INCORRECT.**\n    *   **Correction:** The camera is positioned significantly lower, closer to **chest-level or hip-level**. This is evident because we are looking slightly up at the faces of the people walking towards the camera, and the perspective feels grounded in the torso, not the head.\n\n*   **\"...and maintains a level angle...\" -> INCORRECT.**\n    *   **Correction:** The camera is tilted slightly upward, creating a **low angle**. This angle makes the ceiling more prominent and gives the approaching figures a slightly more imposing presence. A level angle would be aimed straight ahead, parallel to the floor.\n\n*   **\"...capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field.\" -> INCORRECT.**\n    *   **Correction:** The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**. The individuals in the midground are in focus, but the background—including the people and details at the far end of the corridor—is noticeably soft and blurred. Deep focus would render both the foreground and the deep background in sharp detail.\n\n*   **\"It moves smoothly forward...\" -> MISLEADING.**\n    *   **Correction:** The term \"smoothly\" suggests a gimbal, dolly, or stabilizer. This camera's movement has a natural, organic quality consistent with being **handheld by a person walking**. There is a subtle vertical bobbing and slight side-to-side sway. A more accurate description would be \"moves forward with a natural, handheld motion\" or \"dollies forward at a walking pace.\"\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise as requested, but its lack of accuracy means it fails to be informative. It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., altered video speed, lens distortion). However, it misses the opportunity to correctly describe key characteristics:\n\n*   It fails to mention the **handheld quality** of the movement, which is a defining feature of the shot's aesthetic.\n*   It doesn't specify the **focus plane** (midground) as clearly as it could.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption attempts to follow the instructions by addressing height, angle, focus, and movement. However, it fails critically by applying the wrong terminology to what is seen on screen. It uses terms like \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"deep focus\" incorrectly, demonstrating a misunderstanding of these concepts in the context of this specific video.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that accurately follows the instructions for the provided video:\n\n**\"Shot from a chest-level height with a slight low angle, the camera dollies forward at a walking pace through a train corridor. The movement has a natural, handheld quality, simulating a first-person perspective. A shallow depth of field is used, keeping the midground subjects in focus while the background remains softly blurred.\"**",
