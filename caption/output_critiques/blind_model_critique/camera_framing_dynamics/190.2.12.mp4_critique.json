    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use “focus on the man in the foreground” rather than “focus on the foreground.” Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase “tracking the subject(s).” Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking (for example, “tail track the man”).",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. While it captures some basic elements, it suffers from inaccuracies, contradictions, and a lack of completeness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The phrase **\"low-angle shot at eye level\"** is contradictory.\n    *   A **low-angle shot** means the camera is positioned below the subject's eye line, looking up at them.\n    *   An **eye-level shot** means the camera is at the same height as the subject's eyes.\n    *   For this video, the camera is clearly looking up at the men, making it a **low-angle** shot. The camera's physical height is likely **hip-level or waist-level**, not eye-level.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** While \"moves smoothly backward\" is a good start, it lacks the technical term. The movement is a **dolly out** or, more specifically, **tracking backward** since it follows the subjects' movement.\n*   **Focus:** The caption correctly identifies a \"shallow depth of field\" but misses a crucial dynamic element. As the men walk toward the camera, the focus must constantly adjust to keep them sharp. This is called **focus tracking**, a key detail that should have been included.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The caption implies the purpose by saying \"leading the men,\" but it could be stated more clearly as \"tracking the subjects to keep them centered in the frame.\"\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions' demand for precision:\n\n*   It does not correctly describe the **camera height** relative to the ground (e.g., hip-level).\n*   It fails to describe the dynamic **focus changes** (focus tracking).\n*   It uses layman's terms for movement (\"moves backward\") instead of the more precise technical terms encouraged by the instructions (tracking, dollying).\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a hip-level, low-angle shot. The camera tracks backward smoothly, keeping two men in the foreground as they walk toward it. The shot uses a shallow depth of field with continuous focus tracking to maintain sharpness on the subjects while blurring the background.\"**",
