    "pre_caption": "The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow playback. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up. It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground. The camera moves forward while zooming out, maintaining smooth and slow motion throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A video with a speed ramp effect where playback speed smoothly transitions between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and zooming out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt and correctly identifies several key features of the shot, such as the speed ramp and shallow depth of field. However, it contains a major inaccuracy regarding the camera's movement and misses some key details and terminology requested in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow playback.\"** - **Accurate.** The video clearly starts fast, slows down significantly as the man approaches the center, and then speeds up again as he passes.\n    *   **\"The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up.\"** - **Accurate.** The camera is clearly below the subject's eye level, creating a low-angle shot.\n    *   **\"It employs an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground.\"** - **Accurate.** The background is heavily blurred (strong bokeh), isolating the man who remains in sharp focus.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"The camera moves forward while zooming out...\"** - **Highly Inaccurate.** This is the most significant error. The camera is performing the exact opposite movement: it is **dollying backward** while **zooming in**. This specific combination is a famous cinematic technique known as a **dolly zoom** or \"Vertigo effect.\" The purpose is to keep the subject (the man) roughly the same size in the frame while the perspective of the background changes dramatically, creating a sense of unease or altered reality.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but misses several important details that the instructions specifically ask for.\n\n*   **Missing Camera Height:** The caption correctly identifies the **low angle** but omits the **camera height**, which is **ground-level**.\n*   **Missing Specific Movement Terminology:** Instead of the generic \"moves forward,\" the instructions encourage using precise terms like **\"dollying.\"** The correct term here would be **\"dollying backward.\"**\n*   **Missing the \"Dolly Zoom\" Effect:** The caption describes the dolly and the zoom as separate, incorrect actions. It completely misses the opportunity to identify the combined, purposeful **dolly zoom** effect, which is the most prominent technical aspect of the camera's movement.\n*   **Missing Focus Tracking:** While it correctly notes the focus is on the man, it doesn't specify that the camera is performing **focus tracking** to keep him sharp as his distance from the camera changes.\n*   **Missing Movement Purpose:** The caption doesn't explain the *purpose* of the movement, which is to create the disorienting dolly zoom effect.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which adheres to the instructions. However, it sacrifices critical information for brevity.\n*   **Clarity:** The phrase \"maintaining smooth and slow motion throughout\" is ambiguous. The camera's *physical movement* is smooth and at a relatively constant speed, but the *video's playback speed* is what changes from fast to slow. The caption conflates these two different types of \"motion.\"\n*   **Omission of Unnecessary Details:** The caption correctly avoids mentioning the lack of lens distortion or a Dutch angle, which is good.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate, complete, and better adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"The video utilizes a speed ramp, transitioning from fast-motion to slow-motion as the subject approaches, then back to fast-motion. Shot from a ground-level, low angle with an ultra-shallow depth of field, the camera performs a smooth dolly zoom (Vertigo effect): it dollies backward while simultaneously zooming in, keeping the man in focus and at a consistent size while the background appears to stretch away from him.\"**",
