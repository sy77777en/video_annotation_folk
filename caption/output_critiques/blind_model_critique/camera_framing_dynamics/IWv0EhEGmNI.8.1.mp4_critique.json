    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the player's perspective. The player carefully turns left around the door, and when he sees an enemy, the camera tilts up for aiming.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's events and technical aspects.\n\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, eye-level first-person perspective\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera movement mimics natural head movement in a first-person video game, which is slightly unsteady, and the height is consistent with a character's **eye-level**.\n*   **\"the camera turns left around a door\"**: This accurately describes the initial camera movement. In a first-person context, \"turns\" is a more natural term than \"pans,\" and the movement is indeed to the left.\n*   **\"the camera tilts up to aim, shifting the view to a low angle\"**: This is also spot-on. The camera rotates vertically (**tilts up**) to target the enemy, who is on a higher platform. This action correctly results in a **low angle** shot, as the camera is looking up at the subject.\n*   **\"The scene is captured in deep focus, keeping all elements sharp\"**: This is a correct and important observation. In many video games, all elements from the foreground to the background are rendered in sharp focus, which is a perfect example of **deep focus**.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Movement**: It covers the primary movements (**turning** and **tilting**), their purpose (**to aim**), and their quality (**slightly unsteady**).\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It correctly identifies the **camera height** (eye-level) and **camera angle** (starting level, shifting to low angle).\n*   **Focus**: It accurately describes the **depth of field** as deep focus.\n*   **Omissions**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is regular), **lens distortion** (none is apparent), and **Dutch angle** (the horizon is level). This demonstrates a strong understanding of the \"do not mention if not present\" rule.\n\n### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Conciseness**: The description is concise and informative, packing all the relevant details into three clear sentences without any unnecessary words.\n*   **Terminology**: It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., **eye-level**, **tilts up**, **low angle**, **deep focus**).\n*   **Structure**: It describes the camera movements in the correct temporal order (turning first, then tilting).\n*   **Clarity**: The language is clear and easy to understand, effectively translating the visual information into a descriptive text.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is precise, thorough, and well-written, demonstrating a complete understanding of both the video content and the specific requirements of the task. There are no corrections or improvements needed.",
