    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans left while tilting down, then ends with a slight clockwise roll.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and is accurate in many respects, but it is incomplete. It correctly identifies several key camera properties but misses two of the most significant camera movements, which are crucial for a full description of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"recorded at eye level with a level camera angle\" is accurate. The camera is held at a natural height and is not tilted up or down for most of the shot.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** \"mild barrel distortion that causes straight lines near the edges to bow outward\" is a perfect description. The distortion is visible on the pillars and ceiling lines.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus, keeping all elements in the scene sharp\" is correct. Both the subject in the midground and the distant background are in clear focus.\n    *   **Movement Elements:** The description of a \"smoothly pans left,\" a \"tilting downward\" (at the end), and a \"slight clockwise roll\" are all accurate observations of movements that occur.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"Camera movement is steady with minimal shaking\" is accurate. The shot is very smooth, likely achieved with a gimbal or digital stabilization.\n\n*   **What's Slightly Inaccurate:**\n    *   The phrasing \"pans left **while** tilting downward\" is a bit misleading. The camera pans left for the entire duration of the shot, but it only begins to tilt downward in the last few seconds as the subject goes down the stairs. A more precise description would separate these actions temporally.\n\n#### **Completeness: Incomplete**\n\nThis is the main area for improvement. The caption misses two fundamental camera movements that define the shot:\n\n*   **Missing Movement (Translation):** The caption completely omits the **dolly forward**. The camera is not stationary; it is physically moving forward through the hallway, following behind the subject. This is a primary movement, not a secondary one.\n*   **Missing Movement (Purpose):** The caption fails to mention that the camera is **tracking** the subject. The pan, dolly, and tilt are all performed with the clear purpose of keeping the person centered and in frame. The instruction specifically asks to identify \"tracking (following a subject).\"\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions: Good, but Could Be Better**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and correctly omits details like \"regular video speed\" and \"no fixed Dutch angle,\" as per the instructions.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct terminology (barrel distortion, deep focus, pan, tilt, roll, Dutch angle).\n*   **Describing Complexity:** The instructions ask to describe multiple movements and their purpose. By omitting the dolly and tracking movements, the caption fails to capture the shot's full complexity and intent. It describes *some* of the rotational movements but none of the translational ones.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot at eye-level with a level angle, the video exhibits mild barrel distortion. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp. The camera steadily dollies forward and pans left to track a person walking through a hallway. As the subject descends a staircase at the end, the camera tilts downward and performs a slight clockwise roll.\"**\n\n### Why the Revised Caption is Better\n\n1.  **Includes All Movements:** It correctly identifies the **dolly forward** and the **pan left**.\n2.  **States the Purpose:** It explicitly states the camera is **tracking** a person, which explains *why* the movements are happening.\n3.  **Improves Temporal Accuracy:** It clarifies that the tilt and roll happen \"at the end\" as the subject descends the stairs, which is more precise than the original phrasing.\n4.  **More Comprehensive:** It provides a full picture of a complex, continuous camera move, fulfilling the core requirement of the instructions.",
