    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is a perfect example of a caption that is accurate, complete, and strictly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery technical detail mentioned in the caption is a precise and correct description of the video:\n*   **\"aerial, bird's-eye view\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned high above the scene (*aerial*) and is pointing almost directly downward (*bird's-eye*).\n*   **\"deep focus, capturing a wide depth of field\"**: This is also correct. The entire scene, from the waves in the foreground to the distant horizon, is sharp and in focus, which defines deep focus and a wide depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera remains completely static\"**: This is accurate. There is no panning, tilting, dollying, or any other form of movement. The frame is fixed throughout the video.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is concise but covers all the necessary points required by the instructions for this specific video:\n*   **Camera Configuration**: It successfully describes the camera's height, angle, focus, and movement (or lack thereof).\n*   **Omission of Unnecessary Details**: The instructions state, *\"If the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"* The caption correctly follows this rule by not mentioning:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video plays at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable fisheye or barrel distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level.\n    \nBy omitting these \"default\" states, the caption remains concise and focuses only on the defining characteristics of the shot, as instructed.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a superb understanding and application of the instructions:\n*   **Conciseness**: It is brief and to the point, avoiding any unnecessary descriptive language while remaining highly informative.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It uses the specific technical terms provided in the instructions, such as \"aerial,\" \"bird's-eye view,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"static.\"\n*   **Handling Static Shots**: The instructions specify, *\"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static.\"* The caption follows this directive perfectly with the phrase, \"The camera remains completely static.\"\n*   **Clarity and Structure**: The caption is well-structured, first establishing the view and focus, and then confirming the camera's stability.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model response. It accurately identifies the key technical aspects of the video, includes all relevant information while correctly omitting what is not needed, and uses the precise language requested in the instructions.",
