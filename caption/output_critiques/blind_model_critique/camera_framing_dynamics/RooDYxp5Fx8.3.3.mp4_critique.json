    "pre_caption": "The handheld camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It moves forward along the sidewalk, with a slight pan to the right at the end of the video. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. Deep focus is used, keeping all elements in the scene, including the sidewalk, buildings, and vehicles, sharply in focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera moves forward, slightly panning right at the end of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the instructions.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery detail in the caption correctly describes the video:\n*   **\"handheld camera... at eye level and maintains a level angle\"**: This is a precise description of the camera's setup. The perspective matches that of a person walking, and the horizon remains parallel to the frame.\n*   **\"moves forward along the sidewalk, with a slight pan to the right at the end\"**: This accurately captures the primary dolly movement and the secondary pan movement in the correct temporal order.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady with some shaking\"**: This perfectly describes the natural, subtle instability of a handheld shot without exaggeration.\n*   **\"Deep focus is used, keeping all elements... sharply in focus\"**: This is a correct assessment of the depth of field. The foreground (sidewalk), midground (cars), and background (buildings) are all clear, which is the definition of deep focus.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information as required by the instructions, without adding unnecessary details:\n*   **Configuration**: It covers height (`eye level`), angle (`level angle`), movement (`moves forward`, `pan`), steadiness (`unsteady`), and focus (`deep focus`).\n*   **Omission of Defaults**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (which is absent), and Dutch angle (which is not used). This demonstrates a good understanding of the conciseness requirement.\n*   **Movement and Focus**: The description of both movement and focus is detailed enough to be informative (e.g., specifying the pan happens \"at the end\" and listing examples of what's in focus).\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise and Informative**: It provides a comprehensive technical summary in just a few clear sentences.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It uses appropriate terms like `pan`, `unsteady`, and `deep focus` correctly.\n*   **Structured Description**: It logically presents the camera's static properties (height, angle) before describing its dynamic properties (movement, focus).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, easy to understand, and efficiently communicates all the relevant visual information.",
