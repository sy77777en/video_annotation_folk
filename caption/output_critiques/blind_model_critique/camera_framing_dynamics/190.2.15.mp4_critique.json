    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right and tilting down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use “focus on the man in the background” rather than “focus on the background” Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase “tracking the subject(s).” Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption provides a decent foundation but misses several key details that would be apparent in the video. For instance, the video appears to be in slow-motion to emphasize the man's contemplative mood, a crucial detail about the **video speed** that is omitted. While the **camera height** is correctly identified as eye-level, it would be more precise to state it's at the seated man's eye-level from a passenger-seat perspective; the slight downward tilt then transitions the camera from a level angle on the man's face to a high angle relative to the passenger seat, a nuance the caption misses. The description of the **movement** lacks purpose; the pan and tilt are not random but are clearly motivated, tracking the man's gaze as he looks from the road down to a photograph on the passenger seat. The movement is also exceptionally smooth, suggesting a gimbal rather than just \"minimal shaking.\" The **focus** description could be more specific; while the depth of field is shallow, the focus is critically held on the man's face throughout the movement, deliberately leaving the photograph he looks at out of focus, a creative choice not mentioned. Furthermore, the use of a wider lens is evident from the slight barrel distortion on the car's A-pillar, a form of **lens distortion** that is not noted. Finally, the caption only describes the initial shot, completely failing to mention that after this intimate moment, there is a hard cut to a wider, exterior shot of the car driving away, which is a significant part of the video's structure.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera is positioned at the seated man's eye-level from a passenger-seat perspective, capturing his contemplative mood in slow-motion. It smoothly pans from left to right and tilts down, transitioning from a level angle on the man's face to a high angle relative to the passenger seat, tracking his gaze as he looks from the road to a photograph on the passenger seat. The movement is exceptionally smooth, likely achieved with a gimbal, and the shallow depth of field keeps the focus critically on the man's face, deliberately leaving the photograph out of focus. A wider lens is used, evident from the slight barrel distortion on the car's A-pillar. After this intimate moment, there is a hard cut to a wider, exterior shot of the car driving away, adding a significant structural element to the video.",
