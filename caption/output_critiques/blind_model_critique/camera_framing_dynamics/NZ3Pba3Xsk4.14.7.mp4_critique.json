    "pre_caption": "**Video and Camera Configuration Description:**\n\nThe camera is positioned at eye level and begins with a level angle, tracking the red panda as it moves in the zoo. The camera slightly pans to the right to keep the red panda centered, then tilts downward to a high angle as the red panda descends the stairs. Once the red panda reaches the ground, the camera maintains a downward tilt and subtly pans right to continue following its movement from an aerial view. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, and deep focus ensures all elements remain sharp throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the red panda's movements in the zoo, starting with a slight pan to the right to keep it centered in the frame, followed by a downward tilt as the red panda descends the stairs. When it reaches the ground, the camera subtly pans to the right and continues to follow its movement, maintaining a downward tilt.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is very well-written, detailed, and largely accurate. It successfully follows most of the complex instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good** but has one notable inaccuracy and a few minor areas for improvement in precision and conciseness. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the required terminology and structure.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **`eye level` and `level angle`:** This is an accurate description of the shot's beginning. The camera is at the same height as the railing the red panda is on.\n    *   **`tracking`, `pans to the right`, `tilts downward`:** These movements are all correctly identified and described in the correct sequence.\n    *   **`high angle`:** The shift to a high angle as the panda goes down the stairs is accurately noted.\n    *   **`smooth with minimal shaking`:** This is a perfect description of the camera's steadiness.\n    *   **`deep focus`:** Correct. The background and foreground are both reasonably sharp, indicating a deep depth of field rather than a shallow one.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **`aerial view`:** This is the main inaccuracy. An **aerial view** implies a shot from a great height, such as from a drone, helicopter, or a very high crane, looking almost straight down (similar to a bird's-eye view). In the video, the camera is simply at a **high angle**, looking down from a standing position on a walkway. The term `aerial` is an overstatement.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects requested in the instructions: camera height, angle, specific movements (tracking, panning, tilting), steadiness, and focus.\n    *   It correctly omits irrelevant details like video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (none is visible), and Dutch angles (the horizon is level). This shows good adherence to the instruction to be concise where appropriate.\n\n*   **No significant omissions.** The caption is commendably thorough.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption balances detail with readability very well.\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms (`pan`, `tilt`, `high angle`, `deep focus`) as specified.\n    *   **Structure:** The description of camera movement is presented in a clear, temporal order, just as the instructions requested.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Redundancy/Clarity:** The phrase \"...tracking the red panda... slightly pans to the right to keep the red panda centered\" is slightly redundant. Tracking *is* the act of following the subject, which in this case is accomplished by panning. You could combine these ideas for greater conciseness.\n\n---\n\n### Revised \"Excellent\" Caption\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback to be more accurate and concise:\n\n**Video and Camera Configuration Description:**\n\nThe shot begins at eye-level with a level angle, tracking a red panda with a smooth pan to the right. As the subject descends a staircase, the camera tilts down, transitioning to a high angle. It maintains this high angle while continuing to pan right to follow the panda on the ground. The movement is steady throughout, and a deep depth of field keeps both the subject and its surroundings in sharp focus.",
