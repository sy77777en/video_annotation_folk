    "pre_caption": "With a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp, the camera begins at an eye-level, level angle on the blue, holographic figure of a man.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera arcs counterclockwise around the subject, with an upward movement and subtle tilt down to adjust the view angle.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres closely to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is factually correct in every aspect of its description:\n*   **Focus:** It correctly identifies the **\"deep focus\"** where both the foreground/midground figure and the background grid are perfectly sharp.\n*   **Starting Position:** The camera does begin at an **\"eye-level, level angle\"** relative to the holographic figure.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement is precise. The camera executes a **\"very smooth, counterclockwise arc\"** while **\"simultaneously moving upward and tilting down.\"** This compound movement is described perfectly.\n*   **Ending Position:** The movement results in a **\"high-angle perspective,\"** which is an accurate description of the final framing.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption effectively includes all the necessary information required by the instructions without adding unnecessary details.\n*   **Video Speed, Lens Distortion, Dutch Angle:** The video is at regular speed, has no discernible lens distortion, and no Dutch angle. The caption correctly follows the instruction to omit these details for conciseness.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It covers the key aspects:\n    *   **Height & Angle:** It describes both the starting height/angle (\"eye-level, level angle\") and the transition to the final angle (\"high-angle\").\n    *   **Movements:** It identifies the multiple, simultaneous movements (arcing, moving upward, tilting) and their qualities (smoothness, direction). The term \"moving upward\" is a good general description, though \"craning up\" could also be used to describe the sweeping vertical motion.\n    *   **Focus:** It clearly states the depth of field (\"deep focus\").\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is a single, well-structured sentence that is both concise and highly informative, exactly as requested.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specific vocabulary provided in the instructions, such as \"deep focus,\" \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" \"high-angle,\" \"arc,\" and \"tilting.\"\n*   **Structure:** It describes the camera's state and movement in a clear, temporal order: it establishes the initial setup, describes the complex motion, and notes the resulting perspective. This logical flow makes the description easy to follow.\n*   **Purposeful Omission:** By leaving out details about normal video speed and the absence of distortion, it shows adherence to the rule of not mentioning standard or non-existent features.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of the relevant visual information, and written in a clear, concise, and technically correct manner. There are no significant errors or omissions.",
