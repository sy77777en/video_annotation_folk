    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting down.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tilting downward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the initial camera height and the use of a shallow depth of field, it oversimplifies the camera's movement and misses several key details. The movement is described as a \"tilt down to follow a man,\" which is slightly imprecise; in the video, the man is stationary, leaning over the balcony, and the camera tilts down to shift the focus of the shot from a medium shot of his contemplative face to a close-up of his hands gripping the railing, suggesting tension or thought. This movement is not just a tilt but also includes a very slow, almost imperceptible dolly-in, which enhances the intimacy of the final frame on his hands. The caption also fails to note that while the shot begins at a level angle, the downward tilt transitions it into a high angle relative to the man's hands. Furthermore, the focus is not static; as the camera tilts, a subtle rack focus occurs, shifting the plane of sharp focus from the man's eyes to his knuckles, deliberately guiding the viewer's attention. Finally, the use of a wide lens to capture the expansive city view introduces a slight barrel distortion, noticeable in the gentle curvature of the balcony railing at the frame's edges, a detail that adds to the shot's character but is omitted from the description.",
