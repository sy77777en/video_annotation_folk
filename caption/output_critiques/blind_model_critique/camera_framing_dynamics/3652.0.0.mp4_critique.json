    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video where objects are moved frame by frame to create motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect description of the video and an exemplary execution of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a **\"stop-motion animation,\"** which is the most crucial and accurate way to describe the video's creation and perceived motion.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** The description of the camera being at **\"eye level, looking straight ahead\"** is precise. The camera is level with the character's head and is not angled up or down.\n*   **Focus:** The caption accurately notes the **\"shallow depth of field\"** (evidenced by the blurry background) and correctly identifies the focus plane as the **\"character in the midground.\"**\n*   **Movement:** The statement that the camera remains **\"completely static\"** is correct. There is no panning, tilting, zooming, or any other movement.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions that are applicable to this specific video.\n*   It addresses the video's unique motion style (stop-motion), camera position (height and angle), focus properties (depth and plane), and movement (static).\n*   Crucially, it adheres to the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present (e.g., lens distortion, Dutch angle, focus changes, camera movement), which demonstrates a strong understanding of the prompt.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is a model of conciseness. It packs all the necessary information into three short, clear sentences without any redundant wording.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the exact terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"stop-motion,\" \"eye level,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground,\" and \"static.\"\n*   **Clarity:** The description is unambiguous and easy to understand. It follows a logical flow, starting with the overall technique, then moving to camera position, focus, and finally movement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is not just good; it is a perfect example of how to follow the detailed instructions provided. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and masterfully concise by omitting non-applicable information. It demonstrates a complete understanding of both the video's technical aspects and the requirements of the captioning task.",
