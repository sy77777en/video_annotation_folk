    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor construction site in a city at sunset. The sky transitions from a bright blue to a warm orange and yellow. Several tall buildings surround the construction site, including a modern glass skyscraper. Two large construction cranes stand prominently within the site, their metal frames reaching high into the sky. The construction site itself is filled with metal beams, concrete forms, and other building materials. A red concrete pump is also visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully adheres to nearly all the specified rules, resulting in a clear, objective, and informative description.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the caption accurately reflects the video's content, it is highly precise. It correctly identifies key elements like the \"drone\" point of view, the \"outdoor construction site\" setting, the \"sunset\" time of day, and specific objects such as \"glass skyscraper,\" \"metal frames\" on the cranes, and a \"red concrete pump.\" The description of the sky's color change is also a specific and accurate detail.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and covers all the essential aspects requested in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It clearly states the video is \"filmed by a drone.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It establishes the scene as an \"outdoor construction site in a city.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** It specifies the time is \"at sunset.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It describes the surrounding \"tall buildings\" and \"glass skyscraper,\" the \"two large construction cranes\" with their \"metal frames,\" and the \"metal beams, concrete forms, and other building materials\" on the ground.\n*   **Motion/Change:** It effectively captures the primary change in the scene by noting, \"The sky transitions from a bright blue to a warm orange and yellow.\"\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption demonstrates a strong adherence to the specific constraints and guidelines:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet packed with relevant information, giving a full picture without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. While \"warm orange\" is used, \"warm\" is a standard and objective descriptor for colors on that end of the spectrum. It avoids speculative language like \"it seems\" or \"it might be.\"\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description rightly focuses on the setting, architecture, and equipment rather than any people who might be present.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple English, and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description flows logically from the general (the overall scene) to the specific (surrounding buildings, prominent cranes, and ground-level materials).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A drone captures a sweeping view of an outdoor construction site in a city during sunset. The sky shifts from bright blue to warm hues of orange and yellow. Encircling the site are several tall buildings, including a sleek glass skyscraper. Two towering construction cranes dominate the scene, their metal frames stretching skyward. The site is bustling with metal beams, concrete forms, and various building materials, with a red concrete pump standing out among them.",
