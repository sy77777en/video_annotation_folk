    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with a dimly lit atmosphere, focusing on a single subject. The background is dark, creating a stark contrast with the subject, who is centrally positioned. The lighting is soft, casting subtle shadows and highlighting facial features. The subject wears a dark-colored hoodie, adding to the subdued color palette. The environment is minimalistic, with no visible furniture or props, emphasizing the simplicity and focus on the subject. The overall mood is calm and introspective, with no visible movement or changes in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor setting and minimalistic nature of the scene, but it lacks the specificity required by the instructions and includes forbidden subjective interpretations. It omits the point of view, which is a static, eye-level medium shot. The description of the background as simply \"dark\" is too general; the wall is made of dark gray, textured concrete, with visible imperfections. Similarly, \"soft lighting\" is vague; a single key light from the upper left creates a distinct shadow pattern on the right side of the subject's face. The caption's assertion of \"no visible movement\" is inaccurate, as the subject breathes subtly and dust motes float through the beam of light. Furthermore, the description uses subjective language like \"calm and introspective\" and explains the scene's intent by stating it is \"emphasizing the simplicity,\" both of which are interpretive rather than descriptive. A crucial element is also missed: a white, sans-serif text overlay in the bottom-right corner reads \"Episode 04: The Void,\" which should be included as a notable visual element.",
