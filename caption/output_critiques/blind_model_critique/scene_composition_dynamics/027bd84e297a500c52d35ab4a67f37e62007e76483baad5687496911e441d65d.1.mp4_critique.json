    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a series of Russian nesting dolls arranged in a line on a smooth, light-colored surface. The setting is indoors, with a neutral background that emphasizes the dolls. The dolls are intricately painted in shades of blue and white, featuring traditional patterns and facial details. Each doll is slightly smaller than the one behind it, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The scene captures a hand interacting with the dolls, suggesting movement as the dolls are opened or closed. The lighting is even, highlighting the glossy finish of the dolls' surfaces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, is incomplete, and contains inaccuracies regarding the video's content.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Inaccurate Description of Motion:** The caption states that a hand is \"suggesting movement as the dolls are opened or closed.\" This is inaccurate. The video clearly and definitively shows a hand actively picking up, opening, nesting, and closing the dolls. The movement is the central action, not a suggestion.\n*   **Incomplete Color Description:** The caption mentions the dolls are painted in \"shades of blue and white,\" but it completely omits the prominent gold/yellow paint used for details like the hair and patterns, which is a key part of their design.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The instructions require specifying the point of view. The caption fails to mention that this is a close-up, slightly high-angle shot, which positions the viewer directly over the action.\n*   **Vague Description of Action:** The caption is not descriptive enough about the motion. It simply says the dolls are \"opened or closed.\" It misses the core action of the video, which is the process of nesting the smaller dolls inside the larger ones.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violates \"Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives\":** The word \"intricately\" is a subjective adjective that describes the quality of the painting rather than its objective appearance.\n*   **Violates \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption contains several interpretive phrases that explain the *effect* of visual elements, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   \"...with a neutral background **that emphasizes the dolls**.\"\n    *   \"...creating **a sense of depth and perspective**.\"\n    *   \"The lighting is even, **highlighting the glossy finish** of the dolls' surfaces.\"\n*   **Violates \"Avoid speculative statements... or ambiguous options\":** The phrase \"suggesting movement\" is weak and speculative. The phrase \"opened or closed\" presents an ambiguous \"A or B\" option, when the video clearly shows a specific sequence of both actions.\n*   **Violates \"Describe the video by combining details from the frames\":** The caption describes the initial static arrangement and then vaguely mentions the action, but it doesn't integrate the motion as the central theme. It reads more like a description of a still photo with a brief mention of potential movement.",
