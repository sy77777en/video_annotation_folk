Passengers are seated on blue benches and standing, holding onto metal handrails, positioned around the central patch of nature. The interior of the car features colorful panels on the upper walls. The perspective begins low to the ground, pulls back to a wider view of the entire car, and then transitions into a fast, blurred forward motion through the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully captures the essence of the video while adhering strictly to the specified rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a highly specific and unusual scene. It correctly identifies the key elements: the indoor setting of a subway car, the surreal patch of grass and wildflowers on the floor, the checkered pattern of the floor, the color of the benches, the material of the handrails, and the presence of passengers. The description of the camera movement—starting low, pulling back, and transitioning to a fast forward blur—is also a precise and accurate account of the video's motion.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, covering nearly all the required aspects:\n*   **Point of View & Motion:** It expertly describes the changing perspective and camera movement (\"The perspective begins low to the ground, pulls back... and then transitions into a fast, blurred forward motion\").\n*   **Setting:** It clearly identifies the setting as \"inside a subway car.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It provides specific details about the grass, wildflowers (white, blue, purple), floor (checkered), benches (blue), and handrails (metal).\n*   **Subjects:** It includes the passengers and their context (\"seated on blue benches and standing... positioned around the central patch\") without going into excessive detail, as instructed.\n\nThe only elements not mentioned are the time of day and weather, which are irrelevant and likely indiscernible in an artificially lit, indoor setting. Omitting them is correct as it follows the rule to \"avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption demonstrates an outstanding adherence to the detailed instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of visual information into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** The primary focus is on the environment of the subway car and the unique patch of nature within it, with the passengers serving as contextual elements.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words (\"strange,\" \"beautiful\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n*   **No Inference:** It describes exactly what is visible without inferring the purpose or meaning of the scene (e.g., it doesn't call it an \"art installation\" or a \"dream\").\n*   **Motion and Transitions:** It perfectly follows the instruction to describe motion and scene transitions by detailing the camera's movement and the shift to a blurred forward motion.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and structured precisely as requested, resulting in a clear and effective video description.",
