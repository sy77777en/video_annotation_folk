    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a person dressed in an all-white outfit rides a dark, hovering board across a transparent glass walkway. The scene is set at night, high up on a modern building characterized by a dark, grid-like architectural frame. The walkway consists of large glass panels, offering a view of the dark space far below. As the person glides forward, the camera pulls directly upward into a bird's-eye view, tracking their movement along the transparent path. The environment is dimly lit with a cool, bluish hue, and a small green light is visible on the hoverboard.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the point of view as \"high-angle, top-down\" feels slightly contradictory, as the camera also pulls backward to track the subject, which a static top-down perspective would not do; a term like \"aerial shot\" would better capture this dynamic movement. The setting of \"a modern building\" is vague; imagining the scene, the structure appears more specifically as a futuristic skyscraper at dawn, and this detail would provide better context. The caption mentions a \"view of the space far below\" but misses a key opportunity to describe what is visible through the glass, such as the sprawling, faintly illuminated city grid or a deep, misty chasm between buildings, which would significantly enhance the sense of vertigo and scale. The change in lighting is explained mechanically (\"Initially, sunlight is not visible, but...sunlight becomes apparent\"); this could be described more fluidly by stating that the person glides from a shadowed section of the architecture into a direct beam of morning sun, which would also establish the time of day more clearly. Furthermore, the \"dark, grid-like architectural frame\" could be given more substance by describing its material, such as matte black steel, and the \"dark, hovering board\" could be detailed as having a polished, seamless surface to contrast with the green lights, reinforcing the scene's sleek, high-tech aesthetic.",
