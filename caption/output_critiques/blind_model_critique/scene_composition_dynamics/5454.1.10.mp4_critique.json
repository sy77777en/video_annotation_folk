    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured from an objective, low-angle viewpoint, looking up towards an outdoor urban setting under an overcast, pale grey sky. Several individuals are positioned on an elevated walkway or balcony, behind a dark metal railing composed of vertical bars. Directly below the railing, a grey concrete surface displays a white rectangular sign with the black text \"NO BALL GAMES\". In the upper left, bare, dark tree branches are silhouetted against the sky, with portions of a muted-toned building visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres to most of the detailed instructions. However, there are a few specific areas where it could be improved to be fully compliant.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption is highly accurate in its objective descriptions. It correctly identifies the point of view (\"low-angle\"), setting (\"outdoor urban\"), weather (\"overcast, pale grey sky\"), and key visual elements. The descriptions of the \"dark metal railing,\" \"grey concrete surface,\" and the \"NO BALL GAMES\" sign are precise, including details on color, material, and text as instructed. The handling of the human subjects is also excellent, noting their placement without excessive detail.\n*   **Weakness (Motion):** The instructions require a description of any motion or changes. The caption describes a static scene. If the video is completely still, this is accurate. However, if the individuals are moving, the tree branches are swaying, or there is any other form of movement, the caption is incomplete for failing to mention it.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n*   **Violation (Ambiguity):** The most significant error is the phrase **\"walkway or balcony.\"** The instructions explicitly state to **\"avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"** The caption should use a single, definitive term. If the exact nature is unclear, a more general but singular term like \"an elevated structure\" or \"an upper level\" would be more appropriate.\n*   **Adherence (Objectivity):** The caption successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\"), sticking to factual observations.\n*   **Adherence (Formatting):** It correctly provides a single, unformatted paragraph without any introductory text, as requested.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While the caption is concise, it is written as one long, complex sentence. The instructions call for \"simple, natural English\" and a \"clear... and coherent paragraph.\" Breaking it into two or three shorter sentences would improve readability and flow, making it feel more natural.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe caption is strong and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements. It excels in providing objective, detailed descriptions of the scene's components. The main points of failure are the use of an ambiguous \"A or B\" option, which directly violates a specific rule, and the potential omission of motion. Improving the sentence structure would also enhance its clarity.\n\n**In summary, the caption is good, but not perfect.** To be fully compliant, it must eliminate the \"walkway or balcony\" ambiguity and, if applicable, include a description of any movement in the scene.",
