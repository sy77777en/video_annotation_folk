    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a quiet, narrow residential street in Japan during the daytime. The video pans slightly left, revealing more of the paved road ascending a gentle slope. Multi-story houses with balconies line both sides of the street, featuring beige and grey siding. Overhead utility lines crisscross above the road. On the right, a silver Subaru station wagon is parked in a paved driveway next to a house with some green shrubbery and a small white sign bearing Japanese characters. Further down the street on the left, a black car is parked, and a scooter is partially visible in the immediate foreground. The sky appears clear with some light clouds.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and follows the provided instructions with a high degree of accuracy and adherence.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the first-person POV, the setting as a residential street in Japan (supported by the sign and architecture), the time of day, and specific, verifiable details like the \"silver Subaru station wagon,\" the \"white sign bearing Japanese characters,\" and the \"overhead utility lines.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n    *   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly described as a \"narrow residential street in Japan\" with \"multi-story houses\" and a \"paved road.\"\n    *   **Time of Day & Weather:** Specified as \"daytime\" with a \"clear sky with some light clouds.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** Details like the color and type of car (\"silver Subaru station wagon\"), house siding (\"beige and grey\"), and the presence of a scooter and another car are included.\n    *   **Motion:** The camera movement is precisely described as \"pans slightly left.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is a single, coherent block of text that packs in a lot of information without being overly long.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. While \"quiet\" could be considered subjective, in this context, it serves as a factual description of a street with no visible activity, which is acceptable.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The caption avoids words like \"might be\" or \"seems.\" The use of \"appears clear\" for the sky is a standard and natural descriptive phrase, not a speculative guess, and is perfectly fine.\n    *   **Focus on Scenery:** The description rightly focuses on the environment and setting, mentioning objects like cars and a scooter in their context without giving them undue focus.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n    *   **Logical Flow:** The description is well-organized, starting with the overall scene (POV, location) and then moving to more specific details (houses, road, vehicles), creating a clear mental picture for the reader.",
