    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a clean, urban sidewalk in a Japanese city during daytime. The environment is outdoors, with modern mid-rise buildings lining the street, their facades featuring glass, metal, and concrete surfaces in neutral tones. A green metal pedestrian overpass with visible rivets and a sloped ramp stands to the right, while trimmed bushes and a small tree add greenery near a building entrance. The sidewalk is paved with gray and beige tiles, some with tactile paving for accessibility. Blue road signs with white Japanese text and directional arrows are mounted above the street, and traffic flows steadily with black and white vehicles, including a van and a truck, visible at an intersection. The sky is clear and blue, and sunlight casts sharp shadows on the ground. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent and adheres very closely to the provided instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the specified formatting and stylistic rules with a high degree of precision. The few minor points for improvement are subtle and do not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption provides a description that is precise, objective, and filled with verifiable details. Assuming the video matches this description, the accuracy is outstanding.\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption excels at describing specific visual elements with factual language (e.g., \"green metal pedestrian overpass with visible rivets,\" \"sidewalk is paved with gray and beige tiles, some with tactile paving,\" \"Blue road signs with white Japanese text\"). This level of detail makes the scene easy to visualize and grounds the description in concrete reality.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the required elements mentioned in the instructions.\n\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"A first-person POV shot\" and describes the motion (\"moves along a...sidewalk\").\n*   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly states it is \"outdoors\" in a \"Japanese city.\" It describes the architectural features (modern mid-rise buildings), natural elements (trimmed bushes, tree, clear blue sky), and infrastructure (sidewalk, overpass, road signs).\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Explicitly mentions \"daytime\" and implies sunny weather through \"clear and blue\" sky and \"sharp shadows.\"\n*   **Motion:** Captures both the camera movement (\"moves along\") and the movement within the scene (\"traffic flows steadily\").\n*   **Overlays:** Correctly addresses the absence of overlays by stating, \"No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.\" This is a good way to confirm the check was made.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a thorough understanding of both the \"do\" and \"don't\" rules.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Tone and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and inferences about the location's purpose (e.g., \"commercial district\").\n*   **Focus:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and scenery over subjects. The vehicles are mentioned contextually as \"traffic\" rather than being described in excessive detail.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" (with one minor exception, noted below).\n\n**Minor Points for Improvement:**\n1.  **Slightly Subjective Adjective:** The word \"clean\" in \"a clean, urban sidewalk\" is a minor deviation. While it may be an accurate observation, \"clean\" can be interpreted as a subjective quality. A more neutral description might be \"an unlittered urban sidewalk\" or simply omitting the adjective, as the overall description already implies a well-maintained environment.\n2.  **Redundant Phrasing:** The phrase \"as if through the character’s eyes\" is slightly redundant, as \"first-person POV shot\" already conveys this meaning. The instruction asks for concise language, and removing this phrase would make the opening slightly more direct without losing information.\n3.  **Use of \"video\":** The final sentence, \"No overlays or digital elements are present in the video,\" uses the word \"video.\" The instructions state to avoid terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" While \"video\" is not explicitly forbidden, the spirit of the instruction is to describe the scene itself, not the medium. A more compliant phrasing would be, \"No overlays or digital elements are present.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a high-quality caption that serves as an excellent example of how to follow the given instructions. The feedback provided highlights very minor areas for refinement. By addressing these small points—such as replacing \"clean\" and removing the redundant POV explanation and the word \"video\"—the caption would be virtually perfect.",
