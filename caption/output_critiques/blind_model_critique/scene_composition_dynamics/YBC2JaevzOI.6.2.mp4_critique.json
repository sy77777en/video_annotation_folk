    "pre_caption": "The video shows a quiet, empty road at night, bordered by a low concrete barrier on one side and a grassy verge on the other. The scene is illuminated by a series of evenly spaced streetlights that cast pools of white light onto the asphalt, creating a stark contrast with the surrounding darkness. A speed limit sign with a white background and black markings is visible on the right side of the road, mounted on a slender pole. The sky is completely black, with no visible stars or clouds, and the overall environment appears still, with no vehicles or pedestrians present. The road surface is smooth and slightly reflective under the streetlights, and there are no notable overlays or visual effects present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully captures many of the required details but fails to adhere to several key constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is very accurate in its description. It paints a clear and coherent picture of a specific scene (an empty, streetlight-lit road at night) by describing the road, lighting, barriers, and a specific sign. The details are logical and consistent with one another.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but has one major omission:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the point of view (e.g., first-person, dashcam, static shot) and how it influences perception. The caption completely omits this, which is a significant flaw. It is unclear if the camera is static, moving forward like a dashcam, or panning.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a solid overview of the scene without unnecessary words.\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It clearly identifies the setting as an outdoor road at night.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It excels at describing the streetlights, the concrete barrier, the grassy verge, and the speed limit sign, including details like color (\"white light,\" \"white background,\" \"black markings\") and shape (\"slender pole\").\n*   **Avoids Excessive Detail:** It correctly notes the absence of subjects (vehicles, pedestrians) without dwelling on them.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The entire description is focused on the setting and environment, as instructed.\n*   **No Inferred Roles:** It does not speculate on the purpose of the road or the setting.\n*   **Addresses Overlays:** It correctly states that no overlays are present.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere:**\n\n1.  **Use of a Subjective/Auditory Adjective:** The caption begins with \"a **quiet**, empty road.\" The word \"quiet\" describes a sound, which cannot be confirmed visually. The instruction is to describe what is visible and avoid subjective terms. \"Empty\" is a perfect visual descriptor; \"quiet\" is an inference.\n2.  **Use of a Forbidden Speculative Term:** The caption states the \"environment **appears** still.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements and words like \"appears.\" It should have stated factually that the environment is still or that there is no visible movement.\n3.  **Explaining Emphasis:** The phrase \"**creating a stark contrast**\" verges on explaining what the scene emphasizes or highlights, which the instructions prohibit. While it describes a visual fact, the word \"stark\" adds a layer of interpretation about the scene's visual impact. A more neutral description would be \"The white light contrasts with the surrounding darkness.\"\n4.  **Redundant Phrasing:** The caption starts with \"**The video shows...**\" The instructions ask for the description itself, making this introductory phrase unnecessary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is strong in its descriptive accuracy and detail regarding objects within the scene. However, its failure to include the mandatory **point of view** is a major shortcoming. Additionally, it violates several negative constraints by using a non-visual adjective (\"quiet\"), a forbidden speculative term (\"appears\"), and phrasing that borders on interpretive (\"stark contrast\"). With a few edits to remove the forbidden words and add the point of view, it would be an excellent caption that fully adheres to the instructions.",
