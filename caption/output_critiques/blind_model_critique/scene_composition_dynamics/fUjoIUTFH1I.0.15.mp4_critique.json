    "pre_caption": "A quiet, foggy street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans is lined with historic buildings. The main structure is a multi-story, gray-painted building featuring a prominent second-floor balcony with ornate black wrought-iron railings, supported by slender black posts. Hanging planters with yellow and pink flowers adorn the balcony. The ground floor of the building has a series of arched doorways with black grilles, and the upper-story windows are framed by black shutters. The damp asphalt street recedes into the dense fog, where other brick and stucco buildings with similar balconies are faintly visible. A portion of a white car is seen in the lower-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your description captures the architecture and foggy atmosphere well, but it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions and adding more specific visual details from the imagined video. The phrase \"what appears to be\" is speculative and should be removed; if the architecture is characteristic of the French Quarter, state it confidently or simply describe the architectural style. The description of the camera motion feels disconnected; instead of \"As the camera pans to the right,\" integrate the movement more fluidly, such as \"A slow pan from a street-level point of view moves rightward along the block...\" This also clarifies the missing point of view. The phrase \"towards the conclusion of the video\" should be omitted as it refers to a specific part of the timeline. You mention a streetlight becomes visible, but you don't describe if it is on; a key imagined detail would be the soft, hazy glow of the lit streetlight diffusing through the dense fog and casting long, faint reflections on the wet pavement. The description of \"several parked cars\" is vague; you could specify them as \"a line of modern cars\" to create a contrast with the historic setting. Lastly, I imagine the video might have a subtle watermark in the bottom-right corner with the creator's handle, which is a notable overlay that should be included in the description.",
