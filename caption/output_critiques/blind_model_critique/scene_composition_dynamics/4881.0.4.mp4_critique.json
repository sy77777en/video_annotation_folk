    "pre_caption": "In an indoor setting with soft lighting, a person's hands with white-painted fingernails are shown on a small pink tray. One hand applies a dark polish to a nail on the other. The tray, which also holds a small, ornate silver tool, rests on a glass surface next to a pink box and a gold-trimmed glass container. The scene then reveals a man with a mustache wearing a fuzzy, light-blue cardigan, a white top, and a gold chain necklace.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it could be improved to perfectly align with the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key elements: the indoor setting, the action of applying nail polish, the specific objects on the glass surface (pink tray, silver tool, pink box, gold-trimmed container), and the appearance of the man (mustache, fuzzy cardigan, etc.). The description of colors and materials is precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It successfully describes the setting, notable objects, the subject, and the transition within the scene. However, it is missing one element required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions ask to indicate the point of view (e.g., close-up, first-person). The caption implies a close-up that pulls back but doesn't state it explicitly. Adding \"From a close-up point of view...\" at the beginning would make it more complete.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption adheres to most of the rules very well, but there are minor areas for improvement.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It provides a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or speculative language (\"appears,\" \"might be\").\n*   It correctly identifies the setting as \"indoor\" without inferring its purpose (e.g., \"a salon\").\n*   It describes the motion (\"applies a dark polish\") and the scene transition (\"The scene then reveals...\").\n*   It provides good detail on the color, material, and features of the objects.\n\n**Where the caption could be improved:**\n*   **Focus on Subject vs. Scenery:** The instruction states to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\" The description of the man (\"a mustache wearing a fuzzy, light-blue cardigan, a white top, and a gold chain necklace\") is quite detailed. While not a major violation, it slightly shifts the focus more toward the subject than the instructions prefer.\n*   **Missing Point of View:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption fails to explicitly state the point of view, which is a specific requirement of the instructions.\n\n**In summary, the caption is very good because it is accurate, clear, and follows most of the complex rules. To be perfect, it would need to explicitly state the point of view and slightly reduce the level of detail on the subject's clothing to better align with the focus on scenery.**",
