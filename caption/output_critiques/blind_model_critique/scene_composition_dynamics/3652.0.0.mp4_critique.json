    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting resembling a cafeteria or dining area. The environment features tables with trays and cups, suggesting a casual dining atmosphere. The scene includes a character seated at a table, with a focus on their interaction with the surroundings. The background shows blurred figures and elements, indicating a busy or populated area. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor settings, with a mix of warm and cool tones. Notable visual elements include the character's red plaid jacket and the blue and white cups on the table. The setting is enhanced by the presence of yellow caution tape in the background, adding a distinct visual element. Overlays include a small logo in the bottom left corner, indicating branding or network identification.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the indoor cafeteria setting, the character's red plaid jacket, and the overlay logo. However, it misses the crucial instruction to specify the point of view, which appears to be an eye-level shot that remains focused on the character, creating a shallow depth of field that blurs the background. The description of motion is absent; the caption should mention the constant, fluid movement of the blurred figures walking in the background, which contrasts with the relative stillness of the main character. The phrase \"interaction with the surroundings\" is too interpretive; it would be more precise to describe the observable action, such as \"the character slowly scans the room.\" Furthermore, the placement of the \"yellow caution tape\" is not described, leaving its context unclear; a better description would be \"yellow caution tape is strung between a row of chairs in the background, sectioning off an area.\" Finally, the description of the setting as \"resembling a cafeteria or dining area\" is unnecessarily hesitant; given the presence of trays and institutional-style tables, it can be confidently identified as a cafeteria.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an indoor cafeteria setting with tables and trays, creating a casual dining atmosphere. The scene is shot from an eye-level perspective, focusing on a character in a red plaid jacket seated at a table, with a shallow depth of field that blurs the busy background. The character slowly scans the room, contrasting with the constant, fluid movement of blurred figures walking in the background. Bright lighting with a mix of warm and cool tones illuminates the area. Notable visual elements include blue and white cups on the table and yellow caution tape strung between a row of chairs in the background, sectioning off an area.
