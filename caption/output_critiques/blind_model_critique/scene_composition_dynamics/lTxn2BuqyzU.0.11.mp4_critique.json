    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a brightly lit room, likely a medical or educational setting, characterized by pastel-colored walls and a clean, organized environment. A young child with short brown hair is seated at a table, interacting with an adult. The child is wearing a green vest over a white shirt, and the adult is dressed in a green uniform. The table is simple, with a smooth surface, and a few papers are visible. The lighting is soft and even, suggesting daytime. The scene captures a moment of interaction, with the child holding a small object to their face, and the adult gently assisting. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, with a clear emphasis on the interaction between the two subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual details (child, adult, green vest, etc.) are factually correct, the caption's accuracy is undermined by the use of interpretive and speculative language rather than sticking to objective, visible facts.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view (e.g., eye-level static shot, handheld), which is a required element for describing how the viewer perceives the scene.\n*   **Notable Materials:** While it mentions a \"smooth surface\" for the table, it misses opportunities to describe other materials or textures in the room that would better define the setting.\n*   **Motion:** The caption describes a static action (\"holding,\" \"assisting\") but does not describe any broader motion within the scene, if present.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption violates multiple core rules from the instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption uses \"likely a medical or educational setting\" and \"suggesting daytime.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative language (\"likely,\" \"appears\") and inferring the role of the setting. It should only describe what is visibly present.\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"gently assisting\" and describes the atmosphere as \"calm and focused.\" These are subjective and emotional interpretations, which are explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Do Not Explain Emphasis:** The caption states there is \"a clear emphasis on the interaction between the two subjects.\" The instructions directly state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Focus on Setting, Not Subjects:** The caption dedicates significant detail to the subjects' interaction, clothing, and the \"moment\" being captured. This contradicts the instruction to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Do Not Infer Roles:** Calling the adult's clothing a \"green uniform\" infers a professional role, which violates the rule against inferring the function of the setting or its occupants. A more compliant description would be \"a green shirt\" or \"a green top.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is set indoors in a brightly lit room with pastel-colored walls and a clean, organized environment. The camera captures the scene from an eye-level static shot. A young child with short brown hair is seated at a simple table with a smooth surface, where a few papers are visible. The child is wearing a green vest over a white shirt. An adult, dressed in a green top, is present at the table. The child holds a small object to their face, while the adult is nearby. The lighting is soft and even, indicating it is daytime. The room's materials and textures, such as the smooth table surface and pastel walls, define the setting.",
