    "pre_caption": "A time-lapse shot captures the Place Vendôme in Paris at night, with the camera slowly zooming in on the central Vendôme Column. The tall, slender column, which features spiraling relief carvings, is illuminated by a greenish-blue light and topped with a statue. It stands on a large stone pedestal in the center of the square. Surrounding the square are grand, multi-story buildings of a uniform classical design, with illuminated windows and mansard roofs. Ornate, multi-lamp streetlights are positioned throughout the square, their bright lights creating a starburst effect against the dark night sky. A few indistinct people are visible on the ground level. A watermark in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIC CINEMATOGRAPHER.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the static elements of the scene, but it significantly omits the most prominent motion characteristic of a time-lapse in this location. While it mentions the slow zoom, it fails to describe the circular flow of traffic around the square, which would appear as continuous, vibrant streaks of red and white light from vehicle head and tail lights, creating a dynamic ring of light at the base of the scene. The description of \"a few indistinct people\" is also understated; in a time-lapse, they would likely appear as faint, ghostly blurs of motion on the sidewalks, not just static figures. Furthermore, the caption could be improved by specifying the point of view, which seems to be a high-angle shot from one of the surrounding buildings, looking down upon the square. Finally, while the \"greenish-blue light\" on the column is noted, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the strong color contrast created by the warm, golden-yellow glow of the ornate streetlights, which would be a defining feature of the scene's overall color palette.",
