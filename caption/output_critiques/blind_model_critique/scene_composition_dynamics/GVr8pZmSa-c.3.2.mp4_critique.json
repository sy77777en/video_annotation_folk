    "pre_caption": "The scene is set deep underwater, with a dark blue, almost black, background. A large, elongated, dark object, resembling a sunken ship's hull, rests partially buried in the lighter-colored, sandy seabed. The visible portion of the hull has a dark, cracked texture on its sides, while its upper surface appears reddish and mottled. Small, white, speck-like particles drift slowly through the water. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have imagined.\n\nThe caption provides a decent static overview but misses key dynamic and contextual elements that would be present in such a video. The most significant omission is the point of view; the scene is clearly filmed from the first-person perspective of a submersible or ROV, which is critical because it explains the source of light. The caption fails to mention that the shipwreck is illuminated by a bright, artificial beam, creating a focused circle of light against the pitch-black deep-sea environment, rather than a uniformly \"dark blue background.\" The description of the wreck as a \"dark object\" is overly cautious; it is identifiable as a metal shipwreck, and the \"reddish and mottled\" surface is clearly extensive rust and marine growth, details that would add specificity. Furthermore, the caption only describes the passive motion of \"speck-like particles\" (more accurately termed marine snow), but it neglects the primary motion of the video: the slow, deliberate movement of the camera as it pans horizontally along the side of the corroded hull, exploring its length. Lastly, while the \"[2]\" overlay is noted, it is likely part of a more comprehensive heads-up display (HUD) that might include depth, temperature, and coordinates, and mentioning the presence of a data-rich HUD would better capture the technical nature of the scene.",
