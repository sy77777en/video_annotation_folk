A large, elongated, dark object, resembling a sunken ship's hull, rests partially buried in the lighter-colored, sandy seabed.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is a high-quality description that meticulously follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all key visual elements:\n*   **Environment:** The \"deep underwater\" setting with a \"dark blue, almost black, background\" is spot on.\n*   **Main Object:** The description of a \"large, elongated, dark object, resembling a sunken ship's hull\" is precise. It accurately notes that it is \"partially buried\" and details its \"dark, cracked texture\" and \"reddish and mottled\" upper surface.\n*   **Seabed & Particles:** The \"lighter-colored, sandy seabed\" and the \"small, white, speck-like particles\" (marine snow) that \"drift slowly\" are both described correctly.\n*   **Overlays:** The presence of \"Subtitles overlaid at the bottom of the screen\" is accurately noted.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive and provides a full picture of the scene without being overly wordy. It successfully covers:\n*   **Setting and Environment:** The underwater location and dark, deep-sea atmosphere are clearly established.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It details the primary object (the hull), the seabed, and the floating particles, including their color, shape, texture, and position.\n*   **Motion:** The subtle movement of the drifting particles is included, which is the only motion present.\n*   **Overlays:** The subtitles are correctly identified as an overlay element.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates an exceptional adherence to the specific and restrictive rules provided:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"eerie,\" \"mysterious\") and speculative language. The use of \"resembling a sunken ship's hull\" is a good descriptive comparison of form, not a speculative guess, which aligns with the instructions.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description is centered on the environment and the main object, not on any narrative or assumed subjects.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or references to specific moments in the video.\n*   **Overlay Identification:** It properly identifies the subtitles as an \"overlay,\" as instructed.\n*   **No Inferences:** It does not infer the history of the ship or the purpose of the scene (e.g., exploration, research).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, objective, and structured exactly as requested, resulting in a clear and effective description of the video.",
