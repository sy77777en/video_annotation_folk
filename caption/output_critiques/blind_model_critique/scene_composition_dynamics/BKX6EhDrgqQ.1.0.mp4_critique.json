    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the static elements. It correctly identifies the scene as a \"minimalist, abstract space,\" the \"dark gray gradient background,\" the \"stylized figure,\" and the \"white, rounded platform.\" The description of the texture as \"black, wavy lines resembling wood grain\" on both the platform and the \"large spherical shapes\" is precise and correct. The details about the \"tall, white, freestanding kiosk\" with its \"large, blank vertical screen\" are also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to describe the motion within the video, which is a key requirement of the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Motion/Point of View:** The instructions state, \"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe... human-made movements\" and \"indicate the point of view... and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception.\" The video is not a static shot; it features a slow, steady zoom-out. This camera movement is the primary action in the scene, gradually revealing the spherical shapes and the scale of the abstract space. The caption describes the scene as if it were a still image, completely omitting this essential element.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to most of the stylistic and negative constraints.\n\n*   **Strengths:** It successfully provides a concise, informative description using simple, natural English. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and any inference about the scene's purpose. It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery over the subject and follows the formatting rule of a single, unadorned paragraph.\n*   **Weakness:** Its primary failure is not adhering to the instruction to describe motion and point of view, which are present and significant in the video.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because while it is accurate in describing the static objects, it completely misses the fundamental motion of the camera. A core part of describing a video is to capture its dynamic nature. By omitting the slow zoom-out, the caption fails to provide a complete picture of the visual experience and does not fully meet the requirements of the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a minimalist, abstract space against a dark gray gradient background, a stylized figure stands on a white, rounded platform. This platform, along with other large spherical shapes in the scene, is marked with black, wavy lines resembling wood grain. The figure is positioned in front of a tall, white, freestanding kiosk that features a large, blank vertical screen. The camera slowly zooms out, gradually revealing the spherical shapes and emphasizing the scale of the abstract space, enhancing the viewer's perception of the scene's expansive and minimalist design.",
