    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a lush, green landscape of rolling hills covered in dense trees under a dramatic sky. A vibrant rainbow arches across the sky, which is a mix of blue patches and dark, heavy clouds. The foreground consists of a grassy, unkempt clearing with small trees. The view pans upward, following the curve of the rainbow as it rises from behind a hill and extends high into the cloudy expanse, with the tops of green trees visible throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but has a few areas for improvement. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the landscape (\"rolling hills covered in dense trees\"), the sky (\"mix of blue patches and dark, heavy clouds\"), the rainbow, and the foreground (\"grassy, unkempt clearing\") is accurate.\n*   The description of the camera motion (\"The view pans upward, following the curve of the rainbow\") correctly identifies the action in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Information:** The caption fails to mention the **time of day** (daytime), which is a required element according to the instructions.\n*   **Missing Information:** The **point of view** is not explicitly stated (e.g., eye-level shot, handheld shot). While it describes the camera's movement, it doesn't define the perspective.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"No Emotional or Subjective Adjectives\":** The caption uses the word \"dramatic\" to describe the sky, which is a subjective term. The instructions explicitly state to avoid such words. While \"lush\" and \"vibrant\" are also used, they are more descriptive of physical qualities (density of vegetation, intensity of color) and are generally more acceptable, but \"dramatic\" is a clear violation.\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption successfully follows most other rules. It is a single, concise paragraph, avoids speculative language, focuses on the setting, and correctly describes motion without referring to specific frames.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption provides a strong and accurate description of the scene's visual elements and motion. However, it is not a perfect fit for the instructions because it includes a subjective adjective (\"dramatic\") and omits two required pieces of information: the time of day and the specific point of view.",
