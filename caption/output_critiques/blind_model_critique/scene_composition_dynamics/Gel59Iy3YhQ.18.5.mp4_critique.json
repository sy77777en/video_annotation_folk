    "pre_caption": "The scene is set on a paved street in a stylized, cartoonish town during the day. A central red brick building features a white-trimmed window and a light-yellow garage door, which is initially open before closing as the view pulls back to reveal more of the surroundings. A white goose with an orange beak and feet walks on the pavement in front of the building. To the left of the garage is a small market stall under a green awning, displaying crates of produce. To the right, the street includes a red postbox, a small patch of green lawn with a hedge, and a metal gate.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully captures the scene's key details while adhering strictly to the given rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The description of the scene's elements is precise. It correctly identifies colors (\"red brick,\" \"light-yellow garage door,\" \"green awning\"), materials (\"paved street,\" \"metal gate\"), and features (\"white-trimmed window,\" \"crates of produce\").\n*   It accurately captures the motion within the video, noting that the garage door \"is initially open before closing\" and that the \"view pulls back.\" It also mentions the goose \"walks on the pavement.\"\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption provides a comprehensive overview of the setting (\"a paved street in a stylized, cartoonish town\"), time of day (\"during the day\"), and key visual elements.\n*   It includes the central building, the subject (the goose), and surrounding details (market stall, postbox, lawn), creating a full picture of the environment.\n*   It effectively describes the camera movement (\"the view pulls back to reveal more of the surroundings\"), which is a critical component of describing a video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet packed with essential information.\n*   **Neutral and Objective:** It avoids emotional or subjective language (\"beautiful,\" \"charming\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems,\" \"it might be\"). The use of \"stylized, cartoonish\" is a correct description of the visual style, not a subjective opinion.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The goose is mentioned in its context within the scene rather than being the primary focus, which aligns with the instruction to prioritize the setting.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** The caption correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"picture.\"\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Logical Flow:** The description is well-organized, starting with the overall setting, moving to the central building and its action, then describing the subject and the peripheral elements.",
