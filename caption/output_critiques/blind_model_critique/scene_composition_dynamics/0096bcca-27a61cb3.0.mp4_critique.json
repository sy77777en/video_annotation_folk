    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle, shows an urban street scene at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a well-lit intersection with a Gulf gas station prominently visible. Streetlights and traffic signals illuminate the area, casting light on the road and surrounding structures. Vehicles are seen moving along the street, and the gas station is active with cars parked nearby. The environment is calm, with clear weather conditions, allowing for a clear view of the road and the gas station's signage. The scene is characterized by the contrast between the artificial lights and the dark night sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A dashcam POV shot where the dash cam is mounted on a vehicle, capturing the road ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good overall, but it fails to adhere to a few key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy & Completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** Assuming the video does show a dashcam view of a Gulf gas station at night, the description is factually accurate.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully includes the required elements:\n    *   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"a dashcam POV.\"\n    *   **Setting:** Clearly described as an \"outdoors,\" \"urban street scene,\" with a specific landmark (\"Gulf gas station\").\n    *   **Time of Day:** Stated as \"at night.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** Mentions \"Streetlights,\" \"traffic signals,\" and the \"gas station's signage.\"\n    *   **Motion:** Describes \"Vehicles are seen moving.\"\n    *   **Weather:** Notes \"clear weather conditions.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\nThis is where the caption has some issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It does not make speculative statements (e.g., \"it appears to be\").\n*   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery over subject details.\n\n**Where it violates the instructions:**\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses the word **\"calm,\"** which is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood.\n2.  **Explaining Emphasis/Highlights:** The instruction explicitly says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The final sentence, **\"The scene is characterized by the contrast between the artificial lights and the dark night sky,\"** is an analytical statement that explains the visual composition and what it highlights, directly violating this rule.\n3.  **Slightly Interpretive Language:** The phrase **\"prominently visible\"** leans toward explaining the scene's focus rather than just stating the object's presence. Similarly, **\"allowing for a clear view\"** explains the consequence of the weather rather than just describing the weather itself.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is strong in its structure and inclusion of necessary details. However, it needs to be revised to remove the subjective and analytical language to fully comply with the instructions. By eliminating the word \"calm\" and the entire final sentence, the caption would be an excellent and compliant description.",
