    "pre_caption": "From a locked-on POV shot mounted to a vehicle, the scene captures a race on a wide, brown dirt track under a clear blue sky during the daytime. The track is flanked by green, grassy hills and scattered trees, with tents and other structures visible in the distance. A mud-splattered race car is seen from behind as it speeds along the track, kicking up dust before launching into the air as it passes under a large purple archway with \"COOPER TIRES\" written in white text. Several purple, teardrop-shaped flags with \"COOPER\" branding are positioned along the side of the course. A portion of the black, mud-caked roll cage of the camera's vehicle is visible at the bottom of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the setting and key branding elements, but it could more accurately capture the dynamic action and perspective of an off-road race. The phrase \"seen from the front\" is confusing; if the camera is on a vehicle in a race, it's more likely chasing the other car (seeing its rear) or being overtaken by it. The video probably shows the other car approaching from behind and to the side, allowing a view of its front grille before it passes. The description of the action stops abruptly at the car \"launching into the air.\" A more complete description would include the car soaring over the jump, its suspension fully extended and wheels spinning, followed by a hard landing that sends a large cloud of brown dust and dirt flying, momentarily obscuring the view. Furthermore, the \"locked-on POV\" likely involves significant camera shake and vibration as the camera's own vehicle navigates the rough terrain, a crucial visual detail that conveys the intensity of the race but is currently missing. Finally, the video might contain a heads-up display (HUD) overlay in a corner showing telemetry like speed or RPM, which would be an important element to include if present.",
