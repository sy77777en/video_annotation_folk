    "pre_caption": "The video captures an underwater scene in a clear tank filled with water. The setting is indoors, with a focus on a pair of hands interacting with a flexible, light blue object that resembles a tube. The water is clear, allowing for a detailed view of the hands and the object. The background is a plain white surface, enhancing the visibility of the elements within the tank. Bubbles are present, indicating movement and interaction with the water. The lighting is bright, highlighting the smooth texture and glossy surface of the blue object. The scene conveys a sense of clarity and focus on the interaction between the hands and the object within the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the visual elements but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly those regarding interpretation and subjective language.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as an indoor, clear tank filled with water, a pair of hands, a flexible light blue object, a plain white background, and the presence of bubbles. The description of the object's color and shape is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is mostly complete. It covers the main setting, subjects, and key visual elements.\n*   It could be improved by explicitly mentioning the point of view (a fixed, close-up shot) and more directly describing the motion of the hands manipulating the object, rather than just mentioning the resulting bubbles.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several specific instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption repeatedly uses interpretive language to explain the effect or purpose of visual elements instead of just describing them.\n    *   \"...with a **focus on** a pair of hands...\"\n    *   \"...**allowing for a detailed view** of the hands and the object.\"\n    *   \"...**enhancing the visibility** of the elements...\"\n    *   \"...**highlighting** the smooth texture and glossy surface...\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not infer\":** The final sentence is entirely subjective and interpretive.\n    *   \"The scene **conveys a sense of clarity and focus** on the interaction...\" This describes the feeling or message of the scene, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Describe motion\" vs. \"Inferring from elements\":** The caption infers the cause of the bubbles rather than describing the primary motion.\n    *   \"Bubbles are present, **indicating movement and interaction**...\" The instruction is to describe the motion itself (e.g., \"hands squeeze and bend the object, creating bubbles\"), not what the bubbles indicate.\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the instructions:\n\nFrom a fixed, close-up point of view, an indoor scene shows a clear tank filled with water against a plain white background. Inside the tank, a pair of hands manipulates a flexible, light blue, tube-shaped object with a smooth, glossy surface. As the hands squeeze and bend the object, numerous small bubbles rise through the clear water. The scene is brightly lit.",
