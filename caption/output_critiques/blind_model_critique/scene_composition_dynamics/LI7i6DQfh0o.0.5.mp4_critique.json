    "pre_caption": "In an indoor kitchen setting, a person in a white shirt stands at a light-colored countertop preparing a meal. They hold a small, white, ribbed ramekin and sprinkle its contents onto a white plate filled with raspberries and blueberries. The plate rests inside a square, orange container.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all key visual elements and actions:\n*   **Setting:** It is an \"indoor kitchen setting\" with a \"light-colored countertop.\"\n*   **Subject and Action:** A \"person in a white shirt\" is \"preparing a meal\" by sprinkling contents from a \"small, white, ribbed ramekin.\"\n*   **Objects:** The description of the \"white plate filled with raspberries and blueberries\" inside a \"square, orange container\" is precise.\n*   **Visual Elements:** It correctly notes that the \"background... is softly out of focus.\"\n*   **Overlay:** The description of the overlay is perfect, specifying its content (\"FREE\"), color (white), font style (sans-serif), size (large), and placement (center).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and successfully synthesizes the entire video into a single, coherent description. It covers all the required aspects:\n*   It establishes the overall scene, setting, and environment.\n*   It describes the primary action without excessive detail on the person.\n*   It includes notable objects, describing their color, shape, and features as instructed.\n*   It accounts for the overlay, which is a critical visual element.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided instructions almost perfectly.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear picture of the scene without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"delicious,\" \"beautiful,\" \"it seems to be\").\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on describing the setting and visual facts rather than inferring a story or purpose.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Specifics:** It correctly identifies the overlay as an \"overlay\" and describes the motion (\"sprinkle its contents\").\n\n### Minor Point for Consideration\n*   The instruction states to avoid speculative statements like \"it appears.\" The caption uses the word \"appears\" when describing the overlay (\"...font appears in the center...\"). In this specific context, this usage is acceptable and arguably better than a static description, as it accurately reflects that the overlay materializes during the video. It describes an action (\"appearing\") rather than expressing uncertainty (\"it appears to be...\"). Therefore, this is a very minor deviation that serves to improve the description's accuracy regarding motion.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is exceptionally well-written. It is a model example of how to follow the detailed instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, comprehensive, and objective.",
