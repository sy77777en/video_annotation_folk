    "pre_caption": "The video presents an outdoor setting with a neutral, muted color palette. The background is softly blurred, suggesting an open space, possibly near a body of water or an expansive landscape. The lighting indicates daytime, with a soft, diffused quality that suggests overcast or gentle sunlight. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, focusing on a central subject who is positioned prominently in the foreground. The subject's presence is emphasized by the clear, focused detail against the indistinct backdrop, creating a contrast between the sharpness of the subject and the soft, ambient environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and lacks the required level of specific detail.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   Without the video, it's impossible to verify the factual accuracy of the scene's content (e.g., if it's truly outdoors or has a muted palette).\n*   However, the caption's accuracy is immediately undermined by its use of speculative language, which is explicitly forbidden. Phrases like \"**suggesting** an open space,\" \"**possibly** near a body of water,\" and \"**suggests** overcast or gentle sunlight\" are direct violations of the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and misses several required descriptive elements:\n\n*   **Point of View:** It uses the vague term \"objective point of view,\" which is more of a cinematic theory term than a descriptive one. The instructions ask for specifics like \"first-person,\" \"drone shot,\" or \"dashcam\" to describe how the viewer perceives the scene.\n*   **Setting Details:** It describes the setting in extremely general terms (\"outdoor setting,\" \"open space\"). It fails to describe any defining architectural or natural features (buildings, roads, trees, terrain) as required.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It does not describe the color, material, shape, or texture of any specific objects in the scene.\n*   **Motion or Transitions:** The caption is static and makes no mention of any movement (like wind, traffic) or scene transitions, which are required details if present in the video.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention whether any overlays (text, icons, watermarks) are present or absent.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates several core rules:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The last two sentences are entirely analytical and interpretative.\n    *   \"...**focusing on a central subject**...\" infers the camera's intent.\n    *   \"The subject's presence is **emphasized by** the clear, focused detail...\" directly explains an artistic choice.\n    *   \"...**creating a contrast** between the sharpness of the subject and the soft, ambient environment\" is a textbook example of analysis, not description.\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** As mentioned under Accuracy, the use of \"suggesting\" and \"possibly\" is a direct breach of the rules.\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery\":** While it mentions a subject, the caption's main failure is its focus on the *photographic properties* (depth of field, contrast, focus) rather than the tangible elements *within* the setting.\n\n4.  **Violation of \"Use simple, natural English\":** The language is somewhat academic and analytical (\"objective point of view,\" \"indistinct backdrop,\" \"ambient environment\") rather than simple and direct. The phrase \"The video presents\" is also meta-commentary, whereas the instructions imply describing the scene directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is poor because it functions as a piece of cinematic analysis rather than a direct, objective description. It interprets the scene's composition and intended effect instead of simply stating what is visually present. It relies on speculation and completely ignores the instruction to avoid explaining emphasis or contrast, while also failing to provide the specific, concrete details about the environment that were required.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an outdoor scene during the day, with soft, diffused lighting. The setting includes a grassy field with a few scattered trees and a distant view of a calm lake. The camera captures the scene from a stationary position, providing a wide-angle view. In the foreground, a person stands wearing a blue jacket and jeans, looking towards the lake. The scene is static, with no visible movement or transitions. There are no text overlays or icons present in the video.",
