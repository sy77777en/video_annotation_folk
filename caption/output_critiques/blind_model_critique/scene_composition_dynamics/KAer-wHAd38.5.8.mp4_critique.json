    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors on a quiet, sunlit street in a small town or village, with clear blue skies scattered with white clouds indicating midday. The road is paved and lined with a mix of residential and commercial buildings, some with white or green facades and tiled roofs. Lush green trees and neatly trimmed bushes border the street, casting patches of shade on the ground. A few utility poles and wires cross overhead, and flags are visible on poles along the roadside. The scene includes a person riding a motorcycle down the street, moving away from the camera, while other figures and vehicles are visible farther in the distance. The overall environment is calm, with sunlight highlighting the vibrant greenery and the clean, well-maintained appearance of the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and the general sunlit, small-town environment, it lacks specificity and fails to capture the dynamic motion inherent in the video. The description of the street as \"quiet\" and \"calm\" is misleading; the video shows a consistent, albeit not heavy, flow of motorbike traffic, with several riders weaving past and a few cars parked along the curb, suggesting a lively local thoroughfare rather than a tranquil village lane. The caption misses specific details that would enrich the scene, such as the road's distinct yellow centerline or the fact that the \"flags\" are specifically Vietnamese national flags, which clearly situates the location. The description of buildings is too generic; the video clearly shows open-fronted shops on the ground floor with residential apartments above, some featuring balconies with hanging laundry. Most importantly, the caption completely omits the constant forward motion of the rider, the subtle camera shake from the road surface, and the dynamic play of sunlight and shadow moving across the handlebars and pavement as the motorbike travels. It also fails to mention a persistent digital overlay in the bottom-right corner displaying a speedometer and trip distance, which is a key part of the viewing experience.",
