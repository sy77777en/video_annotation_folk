    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene in a natural environment, featuring a large elephant as the central subject. The setting is a rugged landscape with rocky hills in the background, suggesting a savanna or similar habitat. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, natural lighting highlighting the textures and details of the elephant's skin and tusks. The elephant's skin is gray and textured, with prominent wrinkles and markings, while its tusks are curved and ivory-colored. The surrounding vegetation is sparse, with patches of dry grass and low shrubs. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with the elephant standing prominently in the foreground, providing a sense of scale and presence within the expansive landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several core instructions, particularly regarding tone, speculation, and completeness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Without the video, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the described elements (e.g., the presence of rocky hills, the time of day, the elephant's features).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several required details:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** It fails to mention the camera's perspective (e.g., eye-level shot, drone shot, telephoto lens shot), which is a mandatory component of the instructions.\n*   **Motion or Changes:** The caption describes a static scene (\"the elephant standing\"). If there is any movement in the video—such as the elephant walking, ears flapping, or wind moving the vegetation—it has been omitted.\n*   **Scene Transitions:** If the video contains any cuts or transitions to different shots, they are not described.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to adhere to several negative constraints and stylistic rules:\n\n**Violations:**\n*   **Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\" The caption violates this rule with phrases like \"**suggesting** a savanna\" and \"The time of day **appears to be** late afternoon.\"\n*   **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"**calm and serene**,\" which are emotional and subjective terms forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption violates this twice:\n    *   \"...with soft, natural lighting **highlighting the textures and details**...\"\n    *   \"...**providing a sense of scale and presence** within the expansive landscape.\"\n*   **Focus on Subject over Scenery:** The final sentence shifts focus to an interpretation of the elephant's role in the scene (\"providing a sense of scale and presence\") rather than maintaining a neutral description of the setting.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is correctly formatted as a single paragraph without introductory text.\n*   It successfully avoids using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It provides a good description of the elephant's physical features (color, texture, shape) and the surrounding environment (vegetation, landscape), as requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an outdoor scene in a natural environment with a large elephant as the central subject. The setting includes a rugged landscape with rocky hills in the background, typical of a savanna habitat. The lighting is soft and natural, enhancing the visibility of the elephant's gray, textured skin and ivory-colored tusks. Sparse vegetation, including patches of dry grass and low shrubs, surrounds the elephant. The camera captures the scene from an eye-level perspective, focusing on the elephant standing prominently in the foreground. If there are any movements, such as the elephant walking or the wind moving the vegetation, they are not described here. The video does not mention any scene transitions or cuts to different shots.",
