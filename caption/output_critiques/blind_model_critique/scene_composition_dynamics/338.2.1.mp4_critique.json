    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features tables covered with white tablecloths, creating a formal dining environment. The lighting is soft, contributing to a cozy ambiance. Notable visual elements include a glass of lemonade with a slice of lemon and a plate of food, adding to the dining context. The walls are adorned with artwork, enhancing the restaurant's decor. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the dining experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor restaurant setting, but it lacks crucial details and uses prohibited subjective language. It fails to specify the first-person point of view, which places the viewer directly at the table looking down at the meal. The descriptions are too general; for instance, it could specify that the 'artwork' consists of framed black-and-white photographs on dark red walls and the 'plate of food' is a white ceramic bowl containing pasta, from which steam is visibly rising. The statement that the 'scene remains consistent' is inaccurate, as it overlooks the subtle motion of a flickering candle on the table, the condensation on the lemonade glass, and the blurred movement of other patrons in the background. The caption violates the instructions by using subjective terms like 'warm, inviting atmosphere' and 'cozy ambiance' and making inferential statements such as 'creating a formal dining environment.' Additionally, it omits the specific material of the 'white tablecloths,' which are linen, and fails to mention the small, semi-transparent watermark with a creator's handle in the bottom-right corner.",
