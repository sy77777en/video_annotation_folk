The lighting is soft, contributing to a cozy ambiance. Notable visual elements include a glass of lemonade with a slice of lemon and a plate of food, adding to the dining context.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe feedback is broken down into three parts: accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nWithout access to the video, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the visual details described. This feedback assumes that the scene does indeed depict an indoor restaurant with white tablecloths, a glass of lemonade, a plate of food, and artwork on the walls.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld). This is a required element that helps describe how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n*   **Time of Day:** There is no mention of the time of day (e.g., daytime, evening). While \"soft lighting\" might suggest evening, the instructions require explicit statements and forbid speculation.\n*   **Detailed Object Descriptions:** The description of the \"glass of lemonade\" and \"plate of food\" is minimal. The instructions ask for details like material, shape, and texture, which are not included.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints in the instructions:\n\n*   **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this by using words like **\"warm,\" \"inviting,\"** and **\"cozy.\"** These words describe a feeling or an atmosphere rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Inference and Interpretation:** The instruction states, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption repeatedly violates this rule:\n    *   \"...creating a **formal dining environment**.\" (This infers the purpose of the tablecloths).\n    *   \"...contributing to a **cozy ambiance**.\" (This infers the effect of the lighting).\n    *   \"...**adding to the dining context**.\" (This infers the purpose of the food and drink).\n    *   \"...**enhancing the restaurant's decor**.\" (This infers the purpose of the artwork).\n    *   \"...maintaining a **focus on the dining experience**.\" (This explains what the scene emphasizes).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fundamentally misunderstands the core requirements of the instructions. While it correctly identifies some visual elements and presents them in a single paragraph, it heavily relies on subjective, emotional, and inferential language, all of which are explicitly forbidden. It also omits mandatory information like the point of view and time of day. To be successful, the caption must be rewritten to be strictly objective and descriptive, focusing only on what is visually present without interpreting its purpose, mood, or effect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video depicts an indoor restaurant setting with tables covered in white tablecloths. The scene is captured from a static point of view, showing a glass of lemonade with a lemon slice and a plate of food on the table. The glass is transparent, cylindrical, and filled with a yellow liquid, while the plate is round and white, holding various food items. The walls display framed artwork. The lighting is soft, indicating it might be evening, but the exact time of day is not specified. The scene remains consistent, focusing on the dining area without any subjective interpretation.",
