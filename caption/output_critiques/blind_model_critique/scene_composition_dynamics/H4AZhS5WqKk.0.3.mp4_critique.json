    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the main visual elements: the low-angle view, the dark and textured building exterior at night, the single illuminated window, the decorative balcony with its metal railing, and the utility wires with ceramic insulators on the right. The description of the light as \"warm\" and \"yellow\" and the sky as \"dark blue\" is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully captures the point of view, setting, time of day, and all notable architectural details and visual elements within the static scene. It provides a comprehensive overview without missing any significant features.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows most of the instructions well, but it violates two specific negative constraints.\n\n*   **Strengths (Adherence):**\n    *   It correctly identifies the **point of view** (\"low-angle perspective\").\n    *   It provides a **concise yet informative** description of the scene.\n    *   It describes the **color, material, and shape** of notable elements (e.g., \"ornate, dark metal railing,\" \"black utility wires with white ceramic insulators\").\n    *   It avoids using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to a specific point in the video.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective language.\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Violations):**\n    *   **Use of \"appears\":** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The last sentence, \"The surface of the building **appears** damp,\" directly violates this rule. A better phrasing would be, \"The surface of the building is damp.\"\n    *   **Speculative Statement:** The phrase \"**as if from a light rain**\" is an inference about the cause of the dampness. The instruction states to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" Since the rain itself is not visible, this part of the sentence is speculative and should be omitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in terms of its accuracy, detail, and overall structure. It successfully paints a clear picture of the scene. However, to be in perfect compliance with the instructions, the final sentence needs to be revised to remove the forbidden word \"appears\" and the speculative clause \"as if from a light rain.\"",
