    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a long, straight road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky, indicating daytime. The setting is a rural area with open fields on either side, bordered by low vegetation and distant tree lines. The road is paved with a smooth surface, marked by yellow and white lines. Two cyclists are prominently featured, riding along the road, with their colorful jerseys and bicycles adding dynamic elements to the scene. Vehicles and a few people are visible in the background, suggesting a cycling event or race. The overall atmosphere is calm and expansive, with the road and landscape creating a sense of movement and progression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have just watched.\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the outdoor, rural setting and the presence of two cyclists on a long road, but it lacks crucial details and includes speculative and subjective language forbidden by the instructions. It fails to specify the point of view, which is a drone shot tracking the cyclists from behind and above, a key element that establishes the expansive perspective. The description of the cyclists is vague; the video clearly shows one cyclist in a solid red jersey and the other in a blue and white patterned jersey, riding in a single-file line, not just \"prominently featured.\" The caption speculates by \"suggesting a cycling event or race\" instead of describing the visible evidence, such as several parked support vehicles with team logos on the right shoulder and a small group of people standing near them. Furthermore, it omits a significant overlay: a semi-transparent watermark for a sports channel in the bottom-right corner. The description of the road markings is imprecise; it is a dark gray asphalt road with a solid double yellow line down the center and a solid white line marking the shoulder. Finally, the use of subjective phrases like \"calm and expansive\" and \"sense of movement and progression\" should be replaced with a more objective description of the camera's smooth forward motion as it follows the cyclists at a steady pace.",
