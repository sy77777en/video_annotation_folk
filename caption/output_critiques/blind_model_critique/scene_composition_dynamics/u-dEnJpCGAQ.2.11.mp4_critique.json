    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a grassy, wooded area during the daytime. A large, dark tree trunk with textured bark stands prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the view. The ground is covered in vibrant green grass, interspersed with patches of bare, brown earth. In the background, a mix of smaller trees and green foliage creates a dense, natural setting. A cheetah with a spotted coat walks through a clearing in the mid-ground, moving from right to left behind the main tree.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the imagined video content.\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the main subject and setting, it lacks specificity and misses key visual details that define the scene's atmosphere and perspective. The point of view is a static, low-angle shot, which makes the foreground tree feel imposing and gives the viewer a sense of being hidden in the grass, a detail the description omits. The setting is more accurately an African savanna in the late afternoon, not just a generic \"wooded area,\" and the light is a warm, golden hue, casting long shadows across the terrain, which the caption fails to mention. Consequently, the grass is not uniformly \"vibrant green\" but a mix of green and dry, yellow stalks that sway in a gentle breeze, a dynamic element that is overlooked. The cheetah's movement is more of a cautious, stalking pace with its head held low, rather than a simple walk. Furthermore, the description of the tree as just \"dark\" and \"textured\" is vague; its deeply grooved, peeling bark is a more distinct feature. Finally, the caption completely misses a semi-transparent watermark for a nature channel located in the bottom-right corner of the screen.",
