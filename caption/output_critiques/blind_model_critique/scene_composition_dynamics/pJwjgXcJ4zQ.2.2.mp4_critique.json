    "pre_caption": "The video captures an urban street scene in Kabukicho, Tokyo, during the early evening. The setting is outdoors, featuring a bustling street lined with tall buildings. The architecture includes modern structures with glass facades and brick exteriors. Brightly lit signs with Japanese characters adorn the buildings, adding vibrant colors to the scene. The street is narrow, with orange traffic cones lining the sidewalk, guiding pedestrian flow. The sky is clear, transitioning from day to night, casting a soft blue hue. The environment is lively, with people walking along the street, and the atmosphere is typical of a busy city district.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but has several significant issues regarding adherence to the specific and strict rules provided in the instructions. It successfully captures some key elements but fails on multiple negative constraints and omits required information.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the video does show Kabukicho in the evening with the described elements (buildings, signs, cones), the caption is factually accurate in its descriptions. However, without the video, a definitive judgment on accuracy is impossible.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several key details required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption fails to mention the POV (e.g., first-person, handheld, static shot, drone), which is a mandatory element in the instructions. This detail is crucial for understanding how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n*   **Motion:** It mentions \"people walking\" but does not describe any camera movement (e.g., static, panning, walking forward) or other motion like vehicle traffic. The instructions require a description of human-made movements and camera motion.\n*   **Overlays:** The caption does not mention if there are any overlay elements like text, watermarks, or a HUD. If none are present, this is fine, but if they exist in the video, their omission makes the caption incomplete.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several key negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule multiple times.\n    *   **\"bustling street\"**: \"Bustling\" is a subjective interpretation of the activity level. A more objective description would be \"a street with many pedestrians.\"\n    *   **\"vibrant colors\"**: \"Vibrant\" is a subjective quality. The description should state the colors themselves if possible, or simply \"multi-colored signs.\"\n    *   **\"soft blue hue\"**: \"Soft\" is a subjective descriptor.\n    *   **\"environment is lively\"**: \"Lively\" is a subjective judgment of the atmosphere.\n\n*   **Inference and Speculation:** The instructions state, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Avoid speculative statements.\"\n    *   **\"...guiding pedestrian flow.\"**: This infers the *purpose* of the traffic cones rather than just describing their presence and location.\n    *   **\"...the atmosphere is typical of a busy city district.\"**: This is a broad inference and subjective judgment about the scene's character, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Explaining Emphasis:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **\"...adding vibrant colors to the scene.\"**: This phrase explains the *effect* of the signs on the scene, which falls under the category of explaining what an element does or highlights.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to follow several core instructions. To improve it, the author would need to:\n1.  **Add the missing information:** Specify the point of view and describe any camera motion.\n2.  **Remove all subjective adjectives:** Replace words like \"bustling,\" \"vibrant,\" \"soft,\" and \"lively\" with objective descriptions.\n3.  **Eliminate all inferences:** State only what is visibly present. For example, instead of \"cones guiding flow,\" simply state \"orange cones are placed along the sidewalk.\" Remove the entire clause about the \"typical\" atmosphere.\n4.  **Avoid explaining the effect of elements:** Instead of saying the signs \"add color,\" just describe the signs themselves.",

The setting is outdoors, featuring a street with many pedestrians and lined with tall buildings. The architecture includes modern structures with glass facades and brick exteriors. Brightly lit signs with Japanese characters are present on the buildings, displaying various colors. The street is narrow, with orange traffic cones placed along the sidewalk. The sky is clear, transitioning from day to night, with a blue hue. The environment shows people walking along the street. The camera provides a static shot from a street-level perspective, and there are no visible overlay elements such as text or watermarks.",
