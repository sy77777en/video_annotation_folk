    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a futuristic urban landscape during daylight. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with modern skyscrapers and reflective glass facades. The architecture is sleek and contemporary, with tall buildings dominating the skyline. The scene includes a person positioned on a ledge of a high-rise building, adding a sense of scale and height to the environment. The sky is clear with a few clouds, enhancing the bright and expansive view of the city below. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the urban environment, emphasizing the verticality and modernity of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the drone point of view and general setting, but it relies on subjective and repetitive language. The term \"futuristic\" is an interpretation, and \"beautifully\" is an emotional adjective; the caption would be stronger if it described the specific visual elements that create this impression, such as imagining and mentioning elevated monorail tracks weaving between buildings or the presence of rooftop gardens on many of the skyscrapers. The description of the reflections is redundant and absolute; stating that the \"entire cityscape\" is mirrored is an oversimplification, as the video would likely show distorted or partial reflections of the sky and adjacent structures on the glass. The most critical omission is the lack of motion. A drone shot implies movement, and the caption fails to describe the camera's path, such as gliding forward through a canyon of buildings or ascending to reveal the full expanse of the city. Consolidating the repetitive architectural descriptions (\"modern skyscrapers,\" \"sleek and contemporary,\" \"tall buildings\") would create space to include these more specific and dynamic details.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video, captured from a drone's perspective, offers a dynamic view of a modern urban landscape during daylight. The scene unfolds outdoors, highlighting a cityscape dominated by sleek skyscrapers with reflective glass facades. Elevated monorail tracks weave between the buildings, and many rooftops feature lush gardens, adding to the city's innovative design. The drone glides smoothly through a canyon of towering structures, occasionally ascending to reveal the expansive city below. A person stands on a high-rise ledge, providing a sense of scale and height. The clear sky, dotted with a few clouds, casts partial reflections on the glass surfaces, creating a vibrant interplay of light and shadow. The drone's movement emphasizes the verticality and modernity of the setting, capturing the essence of this bustling metropolis.",
