    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors on a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with visible horizontal planks and subtle weathered texture. A soft, fabric-textured suitcase in muted gray rests on the floor, its rectangular shape and rounded corners clearly defined. The suitcase is open, revealing a neatly folded, long-sleeved shirt in a faded red color with white polka dots, along with several rolled-up items in light gray and white tones arranged beside it. The lighting is even and cool, suggesting daytime with no direct sunlight or shadows except for a soft shadow cast by the suitcase. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present. The scene remains static, focusing on the suitcase and its contents within the simple, uncluttered setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent and detailed evaluation of the caption. Here is a breakdown of its performance based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, detailed, and follows most of the complex instructions well. However, it has one clear violation and one significant omission that prevent it from being perfect.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions.\n*   **Objects and Materials:** It correctly identifies the floor as \"pale, whitewashed wooden\" and the suitcase as \"soft, fabric-textured.\"\n*   **Colors and Details:** The colors (\"muted gray,\" \"faded red with white polka dots\") and shapes (\"rectangular shape and rounded corners\") are specific and objective.\n*   **Scene Composition:** The description of the folded shirt and rolled items is precise without being excessive. The mention of the \"soft shadow\" adds a layer of realistic detail.\n\n#### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one key element.\n*   **Included:** It successfully covers the setting (indoors), environment (wooden floor), time of day (implied as daytime via lighting), notable objects, and the absence of motion or overlays.\n*   **Missing:** The caption fails to mention the **point of view**. The instructions explicitly ask to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" Based on the description of looking down at a suitcase on the floor, the POV is likely a high-angle or top-down shot, which is a crucial detail that has been omitted.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to most rules but fails on one important negative constraint.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph without markdown.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n*   It avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"sad\").\n*   It avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"it appears\").\n*   It does not infer the role of the setting (e.g., it doesn't say \"someone is packing for a trip\").\n*   It correctly identifies the static nature of the scene and the lack of overlays.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   The final sentence, \"...**focusing on** the suitcase and its contents...\" directly violates the instruction: **\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"** The phrase \"focusing on\" is an interpretation of the shot's directorial intent, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the omission of the point of view is a failure to adhere to a specific requirement.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the errors while retaining the high quality of the original description:\n\nFrom a high-angle point of view, the video takes place indoors on a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with visible horizontal planks and a subtle weathered texture. A soft, fabric-textured suitcase in muted gray rests on the floor, its rectangular shape and rounded corners defined. The suitcase is open, revealing a neatly folded, long-sleeved shirt in a faded red color with white polka dots, along with several rolled-up items in light gray and white tones arranged beside it. The lighting is even and cool, consistent with daytime, casting a soft shadow from the suitcase. No overlays are present, and the scene remains static.",
