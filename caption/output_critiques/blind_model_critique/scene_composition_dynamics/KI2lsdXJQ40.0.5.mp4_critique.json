    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors on a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with visible horizontal planks and subtle weathered texture. A soft, fabric-textured suitcase in muted gray rests on the floor, its rectangular shape and rounded corners clearly defined. The suitcase is open, revealing a neatly folded, long-sleeved shirt in a faded red color with white polka dots, along with several rolled-up items in light gray and white tones arranged beside it. The lighting is even and cool, suggesting daytime with no direct sunlight or shadows except for a soft shadow cast by the suitcase. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present. The scene remains static, focusing on the suitcase and its contents within the simple, uncluttered setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the core action and minimalist aesthetic, but it could be improved by specifying the point of view, which is likely a high-angle or top-down shot, a crucial detail for this type of scene. The description of the shirt's motion as \"gradually floats\" is somewhat ambiguous; the video might actually depict a stop-motion animation with distinct, incremental movements, which is a different visual effect. A key piece of context is missing: the caption never explicitly states that the suitcase is open, which is necessary for the packing action to occur. Furthermore, the spatial relationship between the items is unclear. The rolled items are \"beside the shirt,\" but it's not specified if they are already inside the suitcase, which seems more logical if the shirt is then placed on top of them. The description of the camera movement feels slightly disjointed; rephrasing it to state that the shot begins centered and then pans to follow the shirt would create a more fluid narrative of the visual sequence. Finally, the \"rolled-up items\" could be more specifically described as \"rolled garments\" to provide a bit more clarity without adding excessive detail.",
