    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a courtroom, characterized by wooden paneling and a formal atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the controlled lighting typical of indoor settings. The scene features a legal professional in traditional attire, including a wig and robe, standing and speaking, likely addressing the court. In the background, several people are seated, possibly jurors or observers, adding to the formal and serious environment. The setting is static, with no visible movement or changes, emphasizing the solemnity and focus of the courtroom proceedings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nWhile it correctly identifies the setting and some visual elements, it violates the rules against using speculative language, subjective adjectives, and explaining the scene's purpose or emphasis.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of the physical scene (indoors, courtroom, wooden paneling, wig, and robe) is likely accurate based on the provided text.\n*   **Inaccurate Contradiction:** The caption states the person is \"standing and speaking\" but then claims the \"setting is static, with no visible movement or changes.\" Speaking is a form of movement, which makes this a direct contradiction.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption completely omits the **point of view** (e.g., eye-level, high-angle shot), which is a mandatory component of the instruction.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Speculative Language:** The instruction states, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   The caption uses \" **likely** addressing the court\" and \"**possibly** jurors or observers,\" which are direct violations of this rule.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Subjective and Emotional Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses \"**formal** atmosphere\" and \"**serious** environment,\" which are subjective interpretations of the mood rather than objective descriptions of the scene.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Explaining Emphasis and Inferring Role:** The instructions state, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The caption violates this rule multiple times with phrases like \"**adding to the formal and serious environment**\" and \"**emphasizing the solemnity and focus of the courtroom proceedings**.\" These phrases explain the *effect* of the scene's elements, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation 4: Wordiness:** The instruction asks for a \"concise\" description in \"simple, natural English.\"\n    *   Phrases like \"characterized by\" and \"typical of indoor settings\" are slightly wordy and could be stated more directly.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions:\n\nFrom an eye-level perspective, the scene is set indoors in a courtroom with wood-paneled walls. The time of day is not discernible due to artificial lighting. A person wearing a black robe and a white wig stands, with their mouth moving as they speak. In the background, other people are seated in rows.",
