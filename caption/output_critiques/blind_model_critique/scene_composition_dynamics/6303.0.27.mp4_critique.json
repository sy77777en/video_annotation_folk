    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor basketball court during the day, surrounded by urban elements. The court's surface is a textured red material, and a basketball with a unique face design is prominently placed in the foreground. In the background, a group of people is engaged in a game, with their movements adding dynamic energy to the scene. The surrounding environment includes graffiti-covered walls and nearby buildings, indicating an urban setting. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting fair weather. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of natural color to the otherwise urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in its general description but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and misses one required element from the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the main subject (basketball court), key objects (basketball with a face, graffiti), the environment (urban), time of day (day), and weather (clear sky).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one crucial piece of information explicitly requested by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions state, \"If relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" The caption does not mention the POV, which is a significant omission. For example, it could be a \"low-angle shot\" or a \"static wide shot,\" which would add important context.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most issues. It violates several specific rules:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":**\n    *   The phrase \"**unique** face design\" is subjective. What one person finds unique, another may not. The instruction would prefer a more objective description, such as \"a basketball with a cartoon face printed on it.\"\n    *   The phrase \"**dynamic energy**\" is an interpretation of the scene's mood rather than a direct description of the action. The instruction states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":**\n    *   The phrase \"**suggesting** fair weather\" is speculative. The instruction explicitly says to avoid terms like \"it appears\" or \"suggesting.\" A better description would be a direct statement of fact: \"The sky is clear with a few clouds.\"\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":**\n    *   The phrase \"**indicating** an urban setting\" is an inference. The instruction is to describe the elements (graffiti, buildings) and let the viewer make the inference.\n\n4.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":**\n    *   The phrase \"**add a touch of natural color to the otherwise urban landscape**\" explains the compositional role of the trees. This is an analytical statement about how the elements function within the scene, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\nHere is a revised version of the caption that adheres strictly to all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a low-angle point of view, the scene is an outdoor basketball court during the day. In the foreground, a basketball with a printed face design rests on the textured red court surface. In the background, several people are playing basketball. The court is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls, buildings, and trees with autumn-colored leaves under a clear sky with a few clouds.",
