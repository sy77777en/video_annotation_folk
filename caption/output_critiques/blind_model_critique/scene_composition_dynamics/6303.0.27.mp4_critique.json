    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor basketball court during the day, surrounded by urban elements. The court's surface is a textured red material, and a basketball with a unique face design is prominently placed in the foreground. In the background, a group of people is engaged in a game, with their movements adding dynamic energy to the scene. The surrounding environment includes graffiti-covered walls and nearby buildings, indicating an urban setting. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting fair weather. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of natural color to the otherwise urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the imagined video content.\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the main elements but misses key visual details and violates some instructions. It fails to specify the crucial low-angle point of view, which places the viewer at court level and emphasizes the basketball. The description of the basketball's \"unique face design\" is too vague; the ball actually features a distinct, stylized cartoon smiley face with 'X's for eyes, which is a central visual hook. The caption also omits the shallow depth of field, where the basketball is in sharp focus while the background players are intentionally blurred, a significant compositional choice. While it mentions \"urban elements,\" it misses more specific features like the weathered chain-link fence bordering the court and the single, tall brick apartment building visible in the distance. Furthermore, it neglects to mention the subtle motion of a few fallen orange leaves blowing across the court's surface, and it misses a small, semi-transparent creator watermark in the bottom-right corner. Finally, the phrase \"adding dynamic energy\" is a subjective interpretation, which the instructions advise against.",
