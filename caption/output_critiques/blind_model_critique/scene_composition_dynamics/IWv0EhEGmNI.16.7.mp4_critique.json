    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent and detailed evaluation of the caption. Here is a breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good and follows most of the instructions with precision. It successfully captures the scene's key elements in a single, coherent paragraph. However, it contains two specific violations related to speculative language, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **High:** The descriptions of the point of view, characters' appearances (woman's hair, man's attire), markings (\"G-25\"), and the overlay (subtitles) are specific and factual. The description of the lighting (\"dimly lit, green-tinted\") and the general environment is precise.\n*   **Inaccuracy/Violation:** The phrases \"possibly an airfield\" and \"likely a helicopter\" introduce speculation. The instructions state to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" If the location is not clearly identifiable as an airfield or the vehicle as a helicopter, these descriptions are inaccurate because they are assumptions, not observations.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is very complete and covers nearly all required elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"over-the-shoulder POV.\"\n    *   **Setting & Environment:** \"outdoors at night in a dimly lit, green-tinted environment.\"\n    *   **Time of Day:** \"at night.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** The \"dark silhouette of a large vehicle,\" \"out-of-focus figures,\" and the man's detailed attire are all included.\n    *   **Motion:** \"The man gestures with a gloved hand while speaking.\"\n    *   **Overlays:** The subtitles are correctly identified as an \"overlay\" with their content, color, and placement described.\n    *   **Subjects:** The subjects are described in a way that establishes context without excessive personal detail, as instructed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear, one-paragraph summary of the scene.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"tense,\" \"dramatic\").\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Focus on Setting:** While it describes subjects, the primary focus remains on the overall scene, lighting, and context.\n*   **Identifies Overlays:** It correctly follows the instruction to specify overlays and describe their content and placement.\n*   **Describes Motion:** It includes the man's gesture, fulfilling the requirement to describe motion.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere:**\n\n*   **Speculative Language:** This is the most significant violation. The use of **\"possibly an airfield\"** and **\"likely a helicopter\"** directly contradicts the rule: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n    *   **Correction:** To adhere to the instructions, the caption should describe only what is visible. For example, instead of \"possibly an airfield,\" it could say \"on a large, flat paved surface.\" Instead of \"likely a helicopter,\" it should state \"the dark silhouette of a large vehicle with rotor blades\" (if blades are visible) or simply \"a large vehicle\" if they are not.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is of high quality and demonstrates a strong understanding of most of the complex instructions. Its structure, detail, and objectivity are excellent. The only flaw is the inclusion of speculative language. By removing the words \"possibly\" and \"likely\" and describing only the observable features of the location and vehicle, the caption would be a perfect execution of the instructions.",
