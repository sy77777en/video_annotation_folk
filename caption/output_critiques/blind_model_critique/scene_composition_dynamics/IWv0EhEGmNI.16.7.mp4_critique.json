    "pre_caption": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a woman with blonde hair in a braided bun, the scene is set outdoors at night in a dimly lit, green-tinted environment, possibly an airfield. In the background, the dark silhouette of a large vehicle, likely a helicopter, is visible with several out-of-focus figures nearby. A man in military attire stands opposite the woman, wearing a dark green beanie and a matching jacket over a grayish-green tactical vest marked with \"G-25\" in black lettering.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the point of view and the primary subjects, but it misses several key dynamic and environmental details that would be present in the video, and it uses speculative language contrary to the instructions. For instance, instead of \"possibly an airfield\" and \"likely a helicopter,\" the description should commit to the visual evidence, such as \"an outdoor tarmac at night\" and \"a large military helicopter.\" The \"green-tinted environment\" could be more precisely described as having a cinematic color grade, and the caption fails to mention other atmospheric elements like a light wind blowing dust across the tarmac or the visible condensation of the characters' breath in the cold air. The description of the man's attire is good but omits details like the tactical pouches and radio attached to his vest. More importantly, the caption completely neglects to describe the woman's clothing (e.g., a dark peacoat or tactical jacket), which would be clearly visible from the over-the-shoulder perspective. The motion is understated; the video likely includes subtle handheld camera shake, a slow zoom-in on the man as he speaks for emphasis, and the constant, subtle movement of the out-of-focus figures in the background as they prepare the aircraft, not just the man's gesturing. Finally, the subtitle description could be more precise, specifying that the character names are in green while the dialogue text is in white, a common formatting choice for clarity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the camera positioned behind a woman with blonde hair in a braided bun. The setting is an outdoor tarmac at night, enveloped in a cinematic green color grade. A large military helicopter looms in the background, silhouetted against the dimly lit environment, while several out-of-focus figures move subtly as they prepare the aircraft. A light wind stirs dust across the tarmac, and the cold air is visible in the condensation of the characters' breath. The woman is dressed in a dark peacoat or tactical jacket, complementing the military theme. Opposite her stands a man in military attire, wearing a dark green beanie and a matching jacket over a grayish-green tactical vest adorned with tactical pouches, a radio, and marked with \"G-25\" in black lettering. He gestures with a gloved hand while speaking, as the camera subtly shakes and slowly zooms in on him for emphasis. At the bottom of the screen, subtitles appear with character names in green and dialogue text in white, indicating a conversation between Laswell, Kyle, and Price.",
