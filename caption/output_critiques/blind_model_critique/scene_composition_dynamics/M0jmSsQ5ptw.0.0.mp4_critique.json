    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good and closely follows the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the major visual elements:\n*   The action of a skydiver exiting an aircraft.\n*   The bright, sunny sky with large, white, puffy clouds.\n*   The sprawling landscape below, characterized by a grid of roads, buildings, and patches of brown and green terrain.\n*   The body of water visible on the horizon.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very thorough, but could be slightly more complete in one area:\n*   **Point of View:** The caption implies an aerial view with \"From high above the ground,\" but it omits that this is a **first-person point of view** (likely from a helmet camera). The instruction asks to specify the POV if relevant, and in this case, it's a key element that immerses the viewer in the experience.\n*   **Motion:** While it mentions the skydiver \"exits an aircraft,\" it doesn't describe the continuous motion of falling or flying through the air, which is the primary dynamic of the entire video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels at following the provided guidelines:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear, one-paragraph summary of the scene without unnecessary words.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly prioritizes the description of the sky and the landscape over the skydiver, as instructed.\n*   **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"amazing\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **No Extraneous Information:** It does not infer the purpose of the scene, mention things that are not visible, or use forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Structure:** It logically describes the scene from the immediate surroundings (sky, clouds) to the elements below (landscape, water).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, well-structured, and adheres strictly to the negative constraints of the instructions. Its only minor shortcoming is the omission of an explicit mention of the first-person point of view and the continuous falling motion, which would have made it even more comprehensive.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person point of view high above the ground, a skydiver exits an aircraft into a bright, sunny sky filled with large, white, puffy clouds, beginning a continuous descent through the air. Below, a sprawling landscape unfolds, marked by a grid of roads and buildings interspersed with patches of brown and green terrain. In the distance, a body of water is visible on the horizon under the clear blue sky.",
