    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the general scenery, but it misses several key dynamic and contextual elements from the video. It fails to specify the first-person point of view from a helmet-mounted camera, which is crucial as the skydiver's arms and legs are occasionally visible at the edges of the view, grounding the perspective. The description is also too static; it doesn't capture the rapid motion of the freefall, the wind distortion, or the experience of clouds rushing past the camera. Furthermore, the caption omits the heads-up display (HUD) overlay in the lower-left corner, which shows constantly updating altitude and speed data in white digital numbers. The description of the aircraft is vague; the video clearly shows the skydiver jumping from the side door of a small, single-propeller plane, which then banks away. Finally, while the landscape is mentioned, the caption doesn't convey the sense of it growing larger and more detailed as the descent continues, a primary visual aspect of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective via a helmet-mounted camera, a skydiver leaps from the side door of a small, single-propeller plane, which banks away as the freefall begins. The rapid descent is exhilarating, with the wind distorting the audio and clouds rushing past the camera. The skydiver's arms and legs occasionally appear at the edges of the view, enhancing the immersive experience. In the lower-left corner, a heads-up display (HUD) overlay provides real-time updates of altitude and speed in white digital numbers. Below, the sprawling landscape becomes increasingly detailed, with a grid of roads and buildings interspersed with patches of brown and green terrain, while a distant body of water glimmers on the horizon under the clear blue sky.",
