    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves from the inside of a smooth, red, funnel-shaped structure with a matte surface and gentle curves, transitioning into a large, indoor swimming pool area. The pool is surrounded by white tiled walls and flooring, with a metal handrail leading into the water. The water’s surface is calm, reflecting the bright overhead lighting, and the environment is clean and minimalistic. The space is illuminated by a round wall light, and an open doorway is visible in the background, contributing to the sense of depth and openness in the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good but has one specific flaw that violates the instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptive details. It precisely describes the two distinct environments (the red structure and the pool area), their materials (\"matte surface,\" \"white tiled walls,\" \"metal handrail\"), shapes (\"funnel-shaped,\" \"gentle curves,\" \"round wall light\"), and the state of the elements (\"water’s surface is calm\"). The description of the transition as a continuous movement is also accurate for a video of someone exiting a water slide.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully includes nearly all the required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n*   **Setting:** Clearly described as an \"indoor swimming pool area\" preceded by a \"funnel-shaped structure.\"\n*   **Motion and Transition:** The movement from the structure into the pool is well-described as a continuous transition.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Excellent detail is provided on the slide, tiles, handrail, and lighting.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the stylistic and content rules, but it fails on one key point.\n\n*   **Strengths in Adherence:**\n    *   It is a single, concise paragraph.\n    *   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It avoids speculation (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than a subject.\n\n*   **Weaknesses in Adherence:**\n    *   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final clause, \"...**contributing to the sense of depth and openness in the setting**,\" is an interpretation of the visual composition's effect. The instruction explicitly forbids explaining the purpose or impact of scene elements. The caption should have simply stated that an open doorway is visible in the background.\n    *   **Minor Subjectivity:** The word \"minimalistic\" is a subjective style assessment. While \"clean\" can be an objective observation of a lack of dirt, \"minimalistic\" is an interpretive label.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is excellent in its descriptive quality, structure, and adherence to most rules. However, it is not a perfect fit for the instructions because it includes an analytical statement about the scene's composition. To be fully compliant, the final interpretive clause should be removed.",
