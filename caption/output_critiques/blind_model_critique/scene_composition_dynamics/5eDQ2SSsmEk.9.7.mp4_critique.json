    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a futuristic, industrial setting viewed from an objective perspective. It takes place in a dimly lit, expansive space, possibly a docking area or a large platform, with a metallic and mechanical aesthetic. The environment is characterized by towering structures and machinery, with beams of light cutting through the darkness, creating a stark contrast. The scene is illuminated by various light sources, including spotlights and glowing red and blue indicators, adding to the high-tech atmosphere. The presence of a vehicle, with sleek, angular design and illuminated elements, suggests movement and activity within this space. The overall ambiance is enhanced by a sense of depth and scale, with scattered particles or stars visible in the background, contributing to the scene's otherworldly feel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n**1. Use of Speculative and Ambiguous Language:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n*   **Caption Violation:** The caption states the setting is \"**possibly** a docking area or a large platform.\" This is a direct violation of the rule against speculation and offering ambiguous options.\n*   **Caption Violation:** It says the vehicle's presence \"**suggests** movement and activity.\" Instead of suggesting, the caption should describe any actual movement that occurs.\n\n**2. Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Caption Violation:** The caption uses several subjective and interpretive terms:\n    *   \"**futuristic**\": This is an interpretation of the style. The instruction requires describing the elements that create this look (e.g., \"sleek, angular designs,\" \"glowing panels\"), not labeling the style itself.\n    *   \"**high-tech atmosphere**\": This describes a feeling or mood, which is subjective.\n    *   \"**otherworldly feel**\": This is another subjective interpretation of the scene's ambiance.\n    *   \"The overall **ambiance is enhanced by**...\": This explains how an element affects the scene, which is forbidden.\n\n**3. Inferring the Role of the Setting:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n*   **Caption Violation:** By describing the location as a potential \"**docking area**,\" the caption infers a specific function for the environment, which is explicitly disallowed.\n\n**4. Incomplete Description of Motion:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe... human-made movements such as traffic flowing...\"\n*   **Caption Issue:** The caption \"suggests movement\" but does not state whether the vehicle, camera, or any other elements are actually in motion. A good caption would definitively state, for example, \"A vehicle with a sleek, angular design drives across the platform.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it relies heavily on speculation, subjective interpretation, and inference rather than providing a direct, objective description of the visible elements and actions as required by the instructions.",
