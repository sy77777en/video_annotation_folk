    "pre_caption": "The video captures an urban street scene during the day, featuring a wide intersection with visible traffic signals and road signs. The environment is outdoors, with a mix of natural and urban elements. Trees with green and pink foliage line the sidewalks, adding a touch of nature to the cityscape. The sky is overcast, suggesting cloudy weather. Buildings of varying heights are visible in the background, contributing to the urban setting. Cars move through the intersection, and pedestrians are present on the sidewalks, indicating a bustling city atmosphere. The crosswalks and road markings are clearly defined, enhancing the structured layout of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\n*   **Video:** An eye-level, handheld shot starts by looking down at a concrete sidewalk next to a street. The camera is shaky, suggesting it's being held by a person walking. We see the feet of other pedestrians. The camera then tilts up and pans right. The pan reveals trees in full bloom with bright pink cherry blossoms mixed with new green leaves. The pan continues across a wide, multi-lane intersection in a modern city. The traffic light for the cars is green, and traffic is flowing steadily. The pedestrian \"Don't Walk\" signal is a lit-up red hand. The sky is a flat, uniform grey. In the background are modern high-rises with glass and steel facades, alongside some older, shorter brick buildings. A semi-transparent channel watermark is visible in the bottom-right corner throughout the video.\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the pan motion from the sidewalk to the street and notes the key elements like foliage, traffic, and buildings, it could be improved with greater specificity and stricter adherence to the instructions. The point of view is omitted; specifying that this is an eye-level, handheld shot would better frame the viewer's perspective. The description of the foliage as a \"vibrant mix of green and pink\" uses a subjective adjective (\"vibrant\"), which should be avoided; a more objective description, such as \"trees with pink blossoms and green leaves,\" would be more precise. Similarly, \"bustling city atmosphere\" is an interpretation rather than a direct observation. The caption misses specific details that would enhance the scene, such as the color of the active traffic signals—for instance, that the light is green for vehicles and the pedestrian signal is a red hand. The description of the buildings is generic; mentioning materials like \"glass-faced high-rises and brick commercial buildings\" would provide a clearer picture. Lastly, the caption fails to mention a plausible overlay, such as a semi-transparent watermark in the bottom-right corner, which is a required detail if present.",
