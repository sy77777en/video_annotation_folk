    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place in an indoor setting resembling a modern shopping or dining area. The environment features a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The ceiling is lined with exposed beams, and the floor is smooth and clean. On one side, there are large windows or glass walls, allowing a view into well-lit interiors, possibly shops or restaurants. Decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding a touch of greenery and warmth. The time of day is likely evening, as the interior lights are prominent, and the atmosphere is calm and inviting. Notable visual elements include a blue fabric banner with white text and a digital display board showing images, suggesting a restaurant entrance. Overlay elements, such as a watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV,\" are present in the lower corner, indicating the video’s source.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions. It successfully identifies the point of view, setting, and some visual elements, but it includes speculation, subjective language, and inferences that were explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the visual details described (first-person POV, indoor walkway, exposed beams, blue banner, watermark) are present in the video, the description of these elements is accurate in its content.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully includes most of the required components: point of view, setting, time of day (though speculative), notable visual elements, and overlays.\n*   It correctly identifies the watermark as an overlay element and describes its content and placement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nHere is a breakdown of where the caption succeeds and fails based on the specific rules:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"first-person POV.\"\n*   **Setting:** It establishes an \"indoor setting\" with a \"long, covered walkway.\"\n*   **Specific Details:** It provides good, objective details like \"exposed beams,\" \"potted plants,\" \"wooden benches,\" and a \"blue fabric banner with white text.\"\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n\n1.  **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The instructions state to avoid \"might be,\" \"it appears,\" \"likely,\" or \"possibly.\"\n    *   **Violation:** \"...**resembling** a modern shopping or dining area.\"\n    *   **Violation:** \"...**possibly** shops or restaurants.\"\n    *   **Violation:** \"The time of day is **likely** evening...\"\n    *   **Violation:** \"...**suggesting** a restaurant entrance.\"\n\n2.  **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state to avoid words like \"beautiful,\" \"inviting,\" etc.\n    *   **Violation:** \"...a **sleek**, contemporary design.\" (\"Sleek\" is subjective.)\n    *   **Violation:** \"...adding a touch of greenery and **warmth**.\" (\"Warmth\" is an emotional/subjective quality.)\n    *   **Violation:** \"...the atmosphere is **calm** and **inviting**.\"\n\n3.  **Do Not Infer the Role of the Scene Setting:** The instructions explicitly forbid inferring the function of the location.\n    *   **Violation:** \"...a modern **shopping or dining area**.\" (This infers the purpose.)\n    *   **Violation:** \"...view into well-lit interiors, possibly **shops or restaurants**.\"\n    *   **Violation:** \"...suggesting a **restaurant entrance**.\"\n\n4.  **Avoid Ambiguous Options:** The instructions state to avoid \"A or B.\"\n    *   **Violation:** \"...large **windows or glass walls**...\"\n\n5.  **Do Not Explain What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** The instructions state to avoid explaining the effect of elements.\n    *   **Violation:** \"...**adding a touch of greenery and warmth**.\" (This explains the effect of the plants and benches.)\n    *   **Violation:** \"...**indicating the video’s source**.\" (This explains the purpose of the watermark, which is an inference.)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it repeatedly violates the core negative constraints of the instructions. While it captures the general scene, its reliance on subjective language, speculation, and inference makes it unsuitable for the required objective and descriptive style. A better caption would strip out all interpretive language and stick strictly to what is visually present.",
