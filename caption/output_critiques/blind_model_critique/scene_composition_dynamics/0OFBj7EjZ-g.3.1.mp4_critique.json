    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a tiled floor, where a large, abstract sculpture resembling a human figure lies horizontally. Surrounding the figure are several wooden structures, possibly resembling shelves or crates, some of which are overturned or leaning. Scattered across the floor are small, colorful objects, adding a sense of disarray. The scene is well-lit, suggesting an artificial light source typical of an indoor environment. The overall composition is structured and geometric, with a focus on the contrast between the orderly grid of the tiles and the chaotic arrangement of the wooden elements and scattered objects. Overlays include text or visual elements, which are not part of the physical scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main components of the scene, but it lacks specificity and misses key visual details that define the environment and the viewer's experience. The description of the sculpture as simply \"abstract\" and \"lying horizontally\" is an understatement; the video shows it is a fragmented, polished white marble figure, with its torso and limbs separated and scattered, suggesting it has been shattered rather than placed. The caption's use of \"possibly resembling shelves or crates\" is speculative; the structures are clearly splintered wooden shipping crates, some with visible stenciling and markings. The \"small, colorful objects\" are more specifically a mix of white packing peanuts and crumpled blue and red tissue paper, indicating the sculpture was recently unpacked or damaged in transit. Crucially, the caption omits any mention of the camera's motion and point of view. The video is filmed from an eye-level perspective, executing a slow, deliberate pan from left to right, which gradually reveals the extent of the damage, creating a sense of discovery. The lighting is not just \"well-lit\" but is cast by harsh, overhead fluorescent tube lights that create sharp, defined shadows on the grey, concrete-tiled floor, characteristic of a storage facility or gallery loading bay. Finally, the \"added text\" is a semi-transparent watermark of a gallery logo, which is a more precise description than the current general statement.",
