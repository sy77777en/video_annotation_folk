    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, sun-drenched desert landscape characterized by white sand dunes and distant, pale mountains. Partially buried in the sand lies the massive, derelict hull of a ship, its rusted red-brown and grey metal contrasting with horizontal white stripes. The vessel is broken, with a smaller superstructure resting askew atop the main wreckage. The scene is set under a clear, pale blue sky during the day, with the bright sun casting a dark shadow from the shipwreck onto the sand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the core elements of the scene, but it describes the video as if it were a static photograph, missing the opportunity to convey motion and dynamic perspective. For instance, the \"ground-level perspective\" could be more specific; the video might feature a slow, low-angle tracking shot that moves alongside the shipwreck, emphasizing its immense scale as it glides past the corroded hull. The description of the ship as \"broken\" is vague; it could be improved by detailing how it is damaged, such as \"fractured in the middle with its stern partially submerged in the sand.\" Furthermore, the caption omits any description of natural movement, such as fine sand blowing across the dunes in the wind or the shimmering effect of heat haze distorting the view of the distant mountains, which would add life to the desert setting. While the colors are noted, the textures could be more vivid; for example, describing the \"peeling layers of paint\" on the white stripes or the \"pitted and crumbling texture\" of the rusted metal would provide a richer visual account. Finally, the shadow is described as static, whereas the video might show the camera moving into or out of the shadow, creating a dynamic shift in lighting from the harsh, bright sun to the cool, dark shade.",
