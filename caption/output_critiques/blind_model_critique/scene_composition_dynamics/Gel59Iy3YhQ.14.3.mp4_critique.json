    "pre_caption": "A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen shows a bustling outdoor kitchen set in a snowy, winter village at night. The central gameplay area is a rectangular arrangement of wooden counters surrounding two snowy patches, bisected by a moving conveyor belt made of blue, icy blocks. In the background, snow-covered pine trees, large decorative candy canes, and wooden stalls with warm lights create a festive atmosphere. Two small, cartoon-like characters, one dressed as Santa Claus, move around the kitchen, interacting with ingredients and appliances. Overlays are present on the screen. At the top, a series of panels displays drink orders. A score and tip multiplier are shown in the bottom-left corner, while a countdown timer is visible in the bottom-right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that masterfully adheres to the provided instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video content.\n*   **Point of View and Setting:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"third-person 3D game\" and accurately describes the setting as a \"bustling outdoor kitchen set in a snowy, winter village at night.\"\n*   **Scene Elements:** The description of the \"rectangular arrangement of wooden counters,\" \"snowy patches,\" and the \"moving conveyor belt made of blue, icy blocks\" is precise. The background details, including \"snow-covered pine trees, large decorative candy canes, and wooden stalls with warm lights,\" are all present and correctly described.\n*   **Subjects:** The description of the \"two small, cartoon-like characters\" is accurate and respects the instruction to avoid excessive detail.\n*   **Overlays:** The placement and content of all overlay elements (drink orders, score, tip multiplier, and timer) are described with perfect accuracy.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, covering all the key aspects required by the instructions.\n*   It includes the point of view, environment, time of day, and notable visual elements.\n*   It successfully describes the materials and colors of key objects (e.g., \"wooden counters,\" \"blue, icy blocks\").\n*   It incorporates the motion within the scene (\"moving conveyor belt,\" characters \"move around\").\n*   It correctly identifies and details all the overlays, which are a significant part of the visual information.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption follows the given rules almost perfectly.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Clarity and Tone:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids speculation, inference, and emotional language, with one minor exception.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery over the subjects, providing just enough context for the characters.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to the sequence of events.\n*   **Minor Deviation:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses \"bustling\" and \"festive.\" While \"bustling\" can be seen as a description of the observable high level of activity, \"festive\" is a subjective interpretation of the atmosphere created by the decorations. This is a very minor point in an otherwise flawless execution, but it is a slight deviation from the strict rule.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is of outstanding quality. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the instructions by creating a description that is both detailed and concise, objective yet vivid. The minor use of a subjective adjective (\"festive\") is the only point of critique in what is otherwise a model example of how to follow the prompt.",
