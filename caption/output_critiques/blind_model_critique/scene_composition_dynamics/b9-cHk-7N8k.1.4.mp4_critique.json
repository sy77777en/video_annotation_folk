    "pre_caption": "A wide, static shot shows a large, white houseboat moored in a calm cove on a lake, surrounded by vast, reddish-brown rock formations and canyons. The time is either sunrise or sunset, with a bright glow on the horizon behind the silhouetted buttes, while the rest of the sky is covered in dark clouds. The still water reflects the sky and the surrounding landscape. A smaller boat is tied to the side of the houseboat, and a paddleboard is visible in the water nearby. The rocky, sandy shoreline in the foreground and along the edges of the cove indicates a low water level. The video is framed with black bars at the top and bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the general scene, but it misses key dynamic and specific visual details that would provide a more complete picture. The shot is a static time-lapse from a high vantage point on the shore, not just an extreme wide shot. This perspective is crucial as it allows the viewer to observe the dramatic movement of the dark, textured clouds across the sky and the shifting light of the sunset, which is clearly identifiable and not an ambiguous \"sunrise or sunset.\" The description of \"still water\" is misleading; while the cove is calm, the time-lapse reveals a subtle, glassy ripple effect on the water's surface as the light changes. The \"large, white houseboat\" is more specifically a two-story vessel with a dark blue trim and a prominent water slide off the back, and its interior lights are on, casting a warm, yellow glow. The smaller boat is a red speedboat, and the paddleboard is bright yellow. Instead of inferring a \"low water level,\" the caption should note the very distinct, white mineral \"bathtub ring\" visible at the base of the red rock formations, a more direct and striking visual. Lastly, the black bars are cinematic letterboxing, and the caption omits a semi-transparent watermark of a compass icon in the bottom-right corner.",
