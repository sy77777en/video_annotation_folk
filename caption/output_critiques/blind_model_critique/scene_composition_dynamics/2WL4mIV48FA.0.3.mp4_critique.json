    "pre_caption": "A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a blue, open-cockpit race car captures the vehicle speeding along an asphalt track. The track winds through a landscape of green, rolling hills under an overcast sky. As the blue car, which features a \"GoPro\" logo on its nose, takes a curve, it overtakes a green and black prototype-style race car with a large rear wing. In the background, a small white building stands near the track, and a single orange cone is visible on the side of the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main action and setting, but it could be improved by adding more specific visual details that are likely present in such a video. The description of the point of view as \"locked-on\" is slightly technical; a more natural phrasing like \"first-person view\" would be better. While the caption mentions the camera is mounted on the car, it doesn't specify where, which significantly changes the perspective. For instance, if mounted on a roll bar, the driver's helmet and hands on the steering wheel would be visible, adding a human element to the action. The description of the track as simple \"asphalt\" misses key details like the red and white painted kerbs the car likely rides over in the corners, or the dark tire marks indicating the racing line. The sense of speed could be better conveyed by mentioning the slight vibration of the camera or how the green hills in the periphery become a motion blur. Furthermore, the \"GoPro\" logo is described as if it were an overlay, but it is a physical decal on the car's bodywork; a true overlay, such as a speedometer or a lap timer in a corner of the screen, is a common feature in these videos and is not mentioned. Finally, describing the cones as two separate sets of obstacles feels disjointed; it would be more effective to integrate them into the action, for example, by noting that the car is navigating a chicane marked by the orange cones.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A first-person view from a camera mounted on the roll bar of a blue, open-cockpit race car captures the thrilling speed as the vehicle races along a winding asphalt track. The track, lined with red and white painted kerbs, snakes through a landscape of green, rolling hills that blur into motion under an overcast sky. As the blue car, adorned with a \"GoPro\" decal on its nose, takes a sharp curve, it skillfully overtakes a green and black prototype-style race car with a large rear wing. The driver's helmet and hands on the steering wheel are visible, adding a human element to the high-speed action. The camera vibrates slightly, enhancing the sense of speed, while dark tire marks on the track indicate the racing line. In the background, a small white building stands near the track, and the car expertly navigates a chicane marked by orange cones. A digital overlay in the corner of the screen displays a speedometer and lap timer, providing real-time racing data.",
