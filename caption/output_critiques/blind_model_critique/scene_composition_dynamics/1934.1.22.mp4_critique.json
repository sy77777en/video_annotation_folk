    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with a minimalist, theatrical stage design. The environment is characterized by a stark black backdrop, creating a dramatic contrast with the subject dressed in a white outfit. The subject's attire includes a cap and gloves, adding to the monochromatic theme. The stage features a raised platform and a large, rectangular element with geometric patterns on the left side, contributing to the abstract aesthetic. The lighting is bright, emphasizing the contrast between the subject and the dark background. The overall scene is devoid of additional props or furniture, focusing on the simplicity and visual impact of the contrasting colors and shapes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"\n\nMake your output sound natural, as if written by a thoughtful human. Keep the tone conversational, clear, and professional—no stiff or overly formal language. Prioritize readability, flow, and conciseness.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a breakdown of the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the minimalist stage design, the black backdrop, the subject's white attire (including cap and gloves), the raised platform, and the rectangular element with geometric patterns. The description of the bright lighting is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing two key details required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention that the scene is captured from a fixed, static point of view.\n*   **Motion:** It completely omits the central action of the video, which is the subject's continuous dancing or performing movements. The instructions state to describe motion if it is present.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption repeatedly explains the purpose or effect of the visual elements instead of just describing them.\n    *   \"...**creating a dramatic contrast** with the subject...\"\n    *   \"...**adding to the monochromatic theme**.\"\n    *   \"...**contributing to the abstract aesthetic**.\"\n    *   \"...**emphasizing the contrast** between the subject and the dark background.\"\n    *   \"...**focusing on the simplicity and visual impact** of the contrasting colors and shapes.\"\n    All these phrases interpret the scene's artistic intent, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing anything not visible\":** The phrase \"The overall scene is devoid of additional props or furniture\" describes an absence rather than what is present. While this helps define the minimalist style, it technically violates this rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because while it is factually accurate, it significantly fails to follow the specific stylistic and negative constraints of the instructions. It consistently explains the *why* (emphasis, contribution, focus) instead of just describing the *what* (the visual facts). It also omits required information about the point of view and the subject's motion.",
