    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person point of view, capturing a lively street scene in a quaint outdoor setting. The time of day is likely afternoon, with a clear sky and scattered clouds. The environment features traditional Japanese architecture, with wooden buildings lining the street, some displaying signs and banners. A notable element is a bright red vending machine positioned near a shop entrance. The street is bustling with pedestrians, some wearing masks, walking along the sidewalk. A silver car is seen driving down the road, which is bordered by a narrow curb. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of color to the scene, and the overall atmosphere is vibrant and dynamic, with people moving about and vehicles passing by.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the Japanese setting, and the presence of pedestrians and vehicles. However, it misinterprets the point of view's movement and includes excessive, sequential detail about passing cars while omitting more significant environmental features. The description of a \"first-person point of view\" is too generic; the video shows a very smooth, forward-walking motion, suggesting the use of a gimbal, which provides a gliding, stable perspective rather than a natural human gait. The caption's play-by-play of each car (\"a silver car exits,\" \"a light blue car,\" \"a silver car,\" \"a black and white car\") is overly detailed and reads like an event log, detracting from the overall scene. In contrast, it misses key architectural details visible on the wooden buildings, such as the dark-stained lattices on the lower floors and the traditional grey-tiled roofs. It also fails to mention the dense web of black utility cables crisscrossing above the street, a prominent feature of the scenery. Furthermore, the caption uses forbidden subjective words like \"lively,\" \"quaint,\" and \"vibrant,\" and a speculative phrase, \"likely afternoon.\" The description could be improved by replacing the car inventory with a general statement about traffic flow and using that space to describe the building lattices, tiled roofs, and overhead wires, while removing all subjective and speculative language.",
