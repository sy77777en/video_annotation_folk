    "pre_caption": "From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set at night within a large, brightly lit athletics stadium. A red running track encircles a green grass infield, with multi-tiered red and white spectator stands visible in the background. Blue banners with white \"TDK\" logos line the edge of the track. Three female athletes, draped in red, white, and blue American flags, are being interviewed near the track as a microphone with a \"Sports\" logo is held up to them. The stadium lights illuminate the scene, while the crowd in the stands remains softly out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A television broadcast-style viewpoint.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the nighttime athletics stadium setting, it misses key dynamic and broadcast-specific elements. The \"television broadcast-style viewpoint\" is not just a perspective but includes a slight, natural sway characteristic of a shoulder-mounted camera, which is not mentioned. A significant omission is the lack of any description of the on-screen graphics typical of a broadcast; the video clearly displays a semi-transparent blue and white lower-third overlay identifying the athletes by name and listing their event as the \"Women's 4x400m Relay.\" The description of the interview is static, failing to capture the motion of the athletes laughing and speaking into the microphone, or the interviewer's arm adjusting its position. Furthermore, the description of the flags as simply \"draped\" is imprecise; the athletes are wearing them as capes over their blue and red team uniforms. Finally, the phrase \"enhancing the scene's realism\" is a subjective interpretation and should be omitted in favor of a more objective description of the shallow depth of field.",
