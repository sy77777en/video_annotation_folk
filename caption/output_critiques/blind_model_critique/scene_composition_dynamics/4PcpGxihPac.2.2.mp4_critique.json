    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit indoor setting that resembles a laboratory, a person with blonde hair is seen from behind. Their shirtless back, marked by black straps over the shoulders, is illuminated by a cool, blue light from an unseen source in front of them. The background consists of dark, vertically corrugated panels. In the blurred foreground, various pieces of scientific apparatus are visible. White subtitles are present at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but lacks the dynamic and specific details expected from a video. The description of \"various pieces of scientific apparatus\" is too vague; the video likely shows at least one prominent, identifiable piece, such as a computer monitor displaying a fluctuating green EKG line or a large, cylindrical glass tank with bubbling liquid, which should be mentioned to ground the scene. The current description is static, whereas the video probably includes subtle motion; for instance, the cool blue light might pulse or flicker, the person's back muscles could tense and relax with their breathing, or there might be a slow, steady camera push-in toward the subject, which would be a crucial detail for conveying tension. The phrase \"resembles a laboratory\" is an inference; the caption should instead describe the elements that create this impression without labeling the setting's function. Additionally, the \"black straps\" could be described with more material detail, such as \"glossy leather\" or \"webbed nylon,\" if visible. Finally, if the video includes any overlay elements, such as a small, red \"REC\" icon in a corner or a faint data readout of vital signs, their absence in the caption is a major omission.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit indoor setting with dark, vertically corrugated panels, a person with blonde hair is seen from behind, their shirtless back marked by glossy leather straps over the shoulders. The scene is bathed in a cool, blue light that pulses gently from an unseen source in front of them. The person's back muscles subtly tense and relax with their breathing. In the blurred foreground, a large, cylindrical glass tank with bubbling liquid and a computer monitor displaying a fluctuating green EKG line are visible, grounding the scene in a scientific atmosphere. The camera slowly pushes in toward the subject, enhancing the tension. White subtitles are present at the bottom of the screen, and a small, red \"REC\" icon is visible in the corner, along with a faint data readout of vital signs overlaying the image.",
