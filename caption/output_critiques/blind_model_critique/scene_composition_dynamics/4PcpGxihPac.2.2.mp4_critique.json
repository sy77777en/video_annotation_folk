Their shirtless back, marked by black straps over the shoulders, is illuminated by a cool, blue light from an unseen source in front of them.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate and adheres closely to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the indoor setting, the dim lighting, the cool blue light source, the person viewed from behind with blonde hair and black straps, the corrugated background panels, the blurred scientific apparatus in the foreground, and the white subtitles. All descriptions are factually correct based on the visual information.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It successfully captures the essential details needed to understand the scene without being overly cluttered. It includes the setting, lighting, a contextual description of the subject, background and foreground elements, and the overlay text, fulfilling all relevant requirements from the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions, with only very minor points for improvement.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the scene.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives and speculative language like \"it seems\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   **Focus on Setting:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and scenery, describing the subject only in relation to their placement and key visual features, as instructed.\n    *   **Element Description:** It effectively describes the color, shape, and texture of notable elements (e.g., \"dark, vertically corrugated panels,\" \"black straps\").\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Minor Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The phrase \"resembles a laboratory\" is a slight inference about the setting's function. While it's a logical conclusion based on the \"scientific apparatus,\" the instruction \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" suggests a more neutral description like \"an indoor setting containing various pieces of scientific apparatus\" would be technically more compliant. However, this is a very minor point, as \"resembles\" is descriptive of its appearance rather than a definitive statement of its role.\n    *   The instruction asks to \"specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene).\" While \"subtitles\" inherently implies an overlay, explicitly stating \"An overlay of white subtitles is present...\" would follow the rule more precisely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the vast majority of the detailed instructions exceptionally well. The minor points noted are subtle and do not detract from the overall high quality and utility of the description.",
