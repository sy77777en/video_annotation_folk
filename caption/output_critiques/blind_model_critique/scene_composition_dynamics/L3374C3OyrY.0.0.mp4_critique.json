    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good but could be improved by including a few missing details as required by the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of a plausible and coherent scene. It logically connects the elements: a wet soccer ball on a pitch at night is struck by a cleat, causing a spray of water. All described details (colors, materials, action) are specific and objective.\n\n### Completeness\nThis is the main area for improvement. The caption is missing a few key elements mandated by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require stating the POV (e.g., first-person, drone shot, close-up). The caption omits this. Based on the description, the POV is likely a **low-angle close-up**, which is a crucial detail for understanding the scene's composition.\n*   **Motion Description:** While it mentions the \"slow motion\" contact, it could be slightly more integrated. The current structure feels a bit like a list of events.\n*   **Overlays:** The caption does not mention any overlays. If the video has none, this is correct. However, if there are any watermarks, text, or icons, they must be described as per the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption adheres very well to most of the stylistic and content rules:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the scene without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"bright\" is used descriptively for the lights, which is appropriate).\n    *   **No Speculation:** It avoids terms like \"appears to be\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   **Focus on Setting:** It correctly prioritizes the setting (pitch, night, lights) and uses the subject (foot, ball) to describe an action within that setting.\n    *   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use \"image,\" \"frame,\" or explain what the scene \"emphasizes.\"\n\n### Revised Caption Example\nHere is an example of how the caption could be revised to be fully compliant with the instructions:\n\n\"From a low-angle close-up, the scene is set on a green soccer pitch at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights. A yellow and black Nike soccer ball, covered in water droplets, rests on the turf. In slow motion, a foot wearing a bright red cleat with a silver swoosh makes contact with the ball, causing a spray of water to erupt from its surface upon impact.\"",
