    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation by describing the mud and the bird's appearance, but it lacks key details that would create a more complete picture. It fails to mention the point of view; for instance, a low-angle, close-up shot would significantly influence the scene by emphasizing the texture of the mud and the bird's movements. The description of the environment as just 'muddy' is too general; adding context like 'a drying riverbed' or mentioning sparse, trampled green grass at the edges would better establish the setting. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the interaction and motion within the scene, such as the bird's feet sinking into the soft mud, the squelching sound this implies, or the ripples created in the puddles as it walks. Finally, the description of the bird and the ground feels a bit disconnected; these elements could be integrated more smoothly to describe the action, and the caption omits any mention of potential overlays, such as a small channel watermark in a corner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a low-angle, close-up shot of a drying riverbed under daylight, where thick, brown mud with uneven surfaces and small puddles of murky, light-brown water dominate the scene. Sparse, trampled green grass lines the edges, adding context to the muddy environment. A bird with a grey back, white underbelly, black wing markings, a grey head, and a prominent yellow wattle and beak navigates the terrain. As it walks, its feet sink into the soft mud, creating a squelching sound and sending ripples through the puddles. The bird's movements are fluid, seamlessly integrating with the textured ground. A small channel watermark is visible in the corner, subtly overlaying the scene.",
