A single maroon long-sleeved shirt with a collar and white polka dot pattern is present, made of a soft, fabric material. The shirt is initially laid out flat with sleeves extended, then is shown neatly folded, occupying a smaller area on the same wooden surface.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and follows the instructions with a high degree of precision.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the whitewashed wooden plank background, and its texture. The description of the shirt—maroon, long-sleeved, collared, with a white polka dot pattern—is precise. The depiction of the action, showing the shirt first laid out and then folded, is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very thorough. It successfully covers all the key aspects requested in the instructions:\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Clearly described as \"indoors against a backdrop of whitewashed wooden planks.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The shirt's color, material, pattern, and form are detailed. The background's texture and arrangement are also noted.\n*   **Motion/Changes:** The transition from the shirt being \"laid out flat\" to \"neatly folded\" is clearly explained.\n*   **Lighting & Overlays:** It correctly states that the lighting is even and that there are no overlays.\n\nThe only minor detail that could have been added is the point of view (e.g., \"a static, top-down view\"), but its omission does not detract from the overall quality, as the description implies a static shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the provided guidelines.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full picture of the scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. While \"neatly\" could be seen as slightly subjective, in this context, it functions as a factual description of the folded state. It successfully avoids speculation or inference about the scene's purpose.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and instead describes the change over time (\"initially... then is shown\").\n*   **Focus:** The focus remains on the setting and the primary object, as instructed, without creating a narrative or inferring a story.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and written in a clear, objective style.",
