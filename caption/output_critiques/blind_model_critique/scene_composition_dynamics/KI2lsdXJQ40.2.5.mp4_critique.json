    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a spacious room with light blue walls and a large window letting in natural daylight. The floor is covered with brown tiles that have a subtle, textured pattern. Several figures, crafted in a stylized manner with elongated heads and simplified facial features, are dressed in dark formal attire and are positioned throughout the room, some standing in small groups and others facing the window.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a very good caption that follows most of the instructions well. However, there are a few key areas where it falls short or could be improved.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. The details are specific and internally consistent (e.g., \"natural daylight\" from a window corresponds with a visible \"overcast sky\"). It describes colors, materials, and the appearance of the figures in a factual, non-interpretive way.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing two key elements required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly ask to indicate the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, panning shot). The caption does not mention how the scene is being filmed, which is a significant omission.\n*   **Motion or Changes:** The caption describes a static scene. If the video contains any camera movement, movement of the figures, or changes in light, the caption fails to describe it. If the video is a completely still shot, the caption is complete in this regard, but it's a critical piece of information for a *video* description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to most of the \"do's\" and \"don'ts\" but violates one important rule.\n\n**Strengths (What it does correctly):**\n\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness:** It provides a lot of information without being overly wordy.\n*   **Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and does not infer the role of the setting (e.g., it doesn't call it a museum or an office).\n*   **Detailing Visuals:** It correctly describes colors (\"light blue walls,\" \"brown tiles\"), materials (\"glass panes\"), and features (\"elongated heads,\" \"textured pattern\").\n*   **Subject Description:** It describes the figures' placement and appearance in a way that complements the scene without giving them a narrative, as instructed.\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly notes the absence of overlays.\n\n**Weaknesses (Where it deviates from instructions):**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The phrase \"creating a calm atmosphere\" violates this rule. \"Calm\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood. A better, more objective description would have been to simply state, \"The lighting is soft and even.\"\n*   **Slight Redundancy:** The final sentence, \"No overlays or additional visual elements are present in the video,\" is slightly redundant. The phrase \"additional visual elements\" is vague. Simply stating \"No overlays are present\" or omitting the sentence entirely (as their absence is implied by not mentioning them) would be more concise.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is excellent in its descriptive quality, objectivity, and structure. Its primary weaknesses are the failure to include the **point of view** and any **motion**, and its minor use of a **subjective adjective** (\"calm\"). By addressing these points, the caption would be a perfect execution of the instructions.",
