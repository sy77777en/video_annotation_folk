    "pre_caption": "The video captures an underwater scene in a vibrant coral reef environment. The setting is outdoors beneath the ocean's surface, showcasing a diverse array of coral formations and marine life. The corals display a variety of colors, including red, white, and shades of brown, with intricate textures and branching shapes. Fish of different species swim around the corals, adding movement and life to the scene. The water is clear, allowing sunlight to illuminate the vivid colors and details of the reef. The overall atmosphere is serene and colorful, highlighting the natural beauty of the underwater ecosystem.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption.\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt at describing the scene but has significant issues with adherence to the provided instructions, particularly the negative constraints.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption accurately describes the general contents of what is presumably a video of a coral reef. The elements mentioned—corals of various colors, fish, clear water, and sunlight—are all plausible and correctly identified for such an environment.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete as it misses several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption fails to mention the point of view. It does not specify if this is a first-person view from a diver, a static shot from a mounted camera, a slow pan, or a drone-like shot moving over the reef. This is a critical omission.\n*   **Motion:** While it mentions the movement of fish, it does not describe any camera motion (e.g., panning, tilting, moving forward), which is essential for describing a video.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention whether any overlays like text, watermarks, or icons are present.\n*   **Specific Features:** The description of textures is not specific. \"Intricate textures\" is a judgment, not a description. The instructions ask for features like \"texture or markings,\" which would be better served by words like \"bumpy,\" \"porous,\" or \"ridged.\"\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n*   **Use of Subjective/Emotional Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words like **\"vibrant,\" \"diverse,\" \"intricate,\" \"vivid,\" \"serene,\"** and **\"colorful.\"** The phrase **\"natural beauty\"** is also highly subjective.\n*   **Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption directly violates this with the phrases **\"adding movement and life to the scene\"** and **\"highlighting the natural beauty of the underwater ecosystem.\"** These are interpretations of the scene's effect, not objective descriptions.\n*   **Word Choice:** The instruction asks for simple, natural English. Phrases like \"showcasing a diverse array of\" are slightly more interpretive and less direct than simply describing what is there.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nIn conclusion, while the caption correctly identifies the basic elements of the scene, it fails to follow the core principles of the instructions. It is overly subjective, interpretive, and incomplete. It reads more like a promotional description than the objective, factual, and detailed scene report the instructions demand. A better caption would have omitted all subjective language, included the point of view, and described textures and shapes with more precise, neutral terms.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an underwater scene in a coral reef environment. The camera moves slowly over the reef, capturing a first-person view as if from a diver. Various corals are visible, displaying colors like red, white, and brown, with bumpy and ridged textures. Fish of different species swim around the corals. The water is clear, and sunlight penetrates the surface, illuminating the reef. No overlays such as text or icons are present. The scene is presented in a straightforward manner, focusing on the natural elements of the underwater ecosystem.",
