    "pre_caption": "The video takes place inside a vehicle at night, with the interior dimly lit by the dashboard’s soft blue and red lights. The dashboard displays illuminated gauges and a digital clock reading 5:23, while the windshield reveals a dark, indistinct outdoor environment. The vehicle’s interior features dark upholstery and a metal security partition with a grid pattern separating the front and back seats. A person in the back seat is visible holding a black rifle with a matte finish and textured grip, positioned near the partition. The scene includes an overlay of green subtitle text near the bottom center that reads, “Price: What is there a difference?” The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones and subtle reflections from the dashboard lights.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully follows nearly all the rules and guidelines, resulting in a clear, objective, and informative description.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It precisely identifies key elements and their features:\n*   **Lighting:** Correctly notes the dim interior lit by \"soft blue and red lights\" from the dashboard.\n*   **Dashboard Details:** Accurately mentions the \"illuminated gauges\" and the specific time on the \"digital clock reading 5:23.\"\n*   **Key Objects:** The \"metal security partition with a grid pattern\" and the \"black rifle with a matte finish and textured grip\" are described with precise details regarding their material, color, and texture, as requested.\n*   **Overlay:** The description of the \"overlay of green subtitle text\" is perfect, including its content, color, and placement.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene without being excessive.\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly establishes the viewpoint from \"inside a vehicle,\" which effectively communicates a first-person or passenger perspective.\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It clearly defines the setting as an indoor space (\"inside a vehicle\") and describes the visible outdoor environment as \"dark, indistinct,\" which is an objective observation.\n*   **Time of Day:** \"At night\" is clearly stated and supported by visual evidence.\n*   **Subjects:** The person is mentioned in context (\"in the back seat\") with their most notable action (holding a rifle), but the description rightly avoids excessive detail about the person themselves, focusing instead on the object they are holding.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels at following the specific constraints of the instructions.\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that flows logically from the general setting to specific details.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. Words like \"soft\" (lights) and \"muted\" (color palette) are used in a descriptive, technical sense rather than an emotional one.\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption masterfully avoids speculation. Instead of guessing what is outside, it correctly labels the view as \"indistinct.\" It does not infer the purpose of the vehicle or the situation (e.g., it doesn't call it a police car or a military transport).\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** While a subject with a rifle is a significant element, the caption gives equal, if not more, weight to the vehicle's interior, the lighting, and the partition, successfully prioritizing the setting as instructed.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It correctly uses the term \"overlay\" for the subtitles and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement\n*   While the description of being \"inside a vehicle\" is effective, the instruction specifically asks to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person.\" The caption could be made even more precise by explicitly stating it is a **first-person point of view** from the front seat, but this is a very minor critique as the current phrasing is clear and effective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and objective, capturing all the essential visual information in a concise and well-written paragraph. It demonstrates a clear understanding of every rule, from describing material and texture to avoiding speculation and emotional language.",
