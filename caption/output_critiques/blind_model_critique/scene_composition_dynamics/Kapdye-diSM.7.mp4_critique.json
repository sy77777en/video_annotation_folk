    "pre_caption": "From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, the perspective moves slowly down a city street during the day. The road is flanked by tall, ornate buildings constructed from light-colored stone, featuring numerous windows and black flags hanging from poles. The paved street is marked with white lines for parking, where several vehicles, including a black SUV, a white van, a dark convertible, and a white SUV, are either parked or in motion. Green trees are interspersed along the sidewalk. The scene is presented with a red and white text overlay in the bottom right corner that reads \"the STRADMAN\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the first-person point of view, the daytime city setting, and the presence of an overlay, but it misses the central focus and atmosphere of the scene. While it lists several generic vehicles, it fails to mention the main subject: a vibrant, metallic purple hypercar that is the clear focal point towards which the camera is moving. The descriptions of the other cars as a \"dark sedan\" or \"white van\" are too vague; the video shows these are also high-end luxury vehicles, which contributes to the opulent feel of the location, likely a famous district like Rodeo Drive or a street in Monaco, given the architecture and density of exotic cars. The caption mentions \"ornate buildings,\" but omits that their ground floors are occupied by recognizable luxury brand storefronts with large glass windows. Furthermore, the description of movement as simply \"slowly down a city street\" is imprecise; the camera actually glides smoothly along the sidewalk, its movement deliberately slowing and panning to build anticipation before finally resting its gaze on the purple hypercar. The caption also neglects to mention the bright, sunny weather, which creates sharp shadows and causes intense, specular reflections on the cars' polished paint and the buildings' windows, a key visual characteristic of the scene.",
