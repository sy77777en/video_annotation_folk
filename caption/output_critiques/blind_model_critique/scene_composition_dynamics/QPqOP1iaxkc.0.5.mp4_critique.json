    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a narrow corridor within a public transit station. On one side, a large green metal wall features a black door with a small window labeled \"D-2.\" Opposite the green wall is a white-tiled wall with a yellow emergency call box and a digital display screen. The corridor contains a large, boxy kiosk with a glass window and a beige vented panel. Further down the corridor, two police officers in dark uniforms stand near the white wall. The space is illuminated by overhead artificial lighting, and the floor is made of dark tiles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the sequence of movement and the key elements of the scene, but it could be improved by adding more specific textural and atmospheric details that were present. For instance, the \"green metal wall\" in the passageway was visibly worn, with scratches and minor dents suggesting heavy use, and the \"overhead artificial lighting\" inside the room cast a distinct, cool-white fluorescent glare, creating sharp, defined shadows. The caption mentions a \"digital display screen,\" but fails to note that it was displaying a static, blue-and-white schematic map of the station's security zones, which provides important context. Furthermore, after entering the room, the camera does not remain static; it performs a slow, deliberate pan from left to right, first lingering on the empty security kiosk before moving to the two police officers, who were standing at ease and conversing quietly, not just standing. The description of the kiosk as \"boxy\" is accurate, but it omits the detail that the glass window was reinforced with visible wire mesh. Finally, the phrasing \"distinct from a yellow emergency call box\" is slightly awkward; stating their relative positions, such as \"a digital display screen is mounted on the white wall, several feet away from a yellow emergency call box,\" would create a clearer spatial relationship.",
