A vertical, glowing light tube stands on the floor, casting a bright, cool-toned light. Three women in dresses and heels are positioned around this light source.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the core elements of the scene, particularly the lighting, the subjects' presence, and the focus on the prosthetic leg. However, it could be improved by more fully integrating the visual components to create a more cohesive description of the video's flow and atmosphere. The caption mentions a \"reflective floor\" but misses the opportunity to describe the prominent reflections of the vibrant pink, purple, and cool-toned lights, which would be a significant visual element. It also describes the camera's downward tilt but doesn't establish the initial point of view, which I imagine is a medium shot capturing the women from the waist down before the movement begins. Furthermore, while the prosthetic is noted, the \"intricate dark patterns\" could be more specifically described; in the video, it appears to be a glossy carbon fiber weave, a detail that adds a specific texture and modern feel. Finally, the caption presents the women as static, whereas in the video they are holding dynamic, stylized poses and shifting their weight subtly, which adds life to the scene and complements the sleek, fashion-shoot aesthetic. A more effective caption would describe how the camera's smooth, deliberate tilt down their bodies serves to reveal the prosthetic as the shot's focal point, connecting the initial wider view with the final detailed shot of the footwear.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an indoor studio setting, a scene unfolds against a plain wall bathed in vibrant pink and purple light. Initially, the camera captures a medium shot of three women in dresses and heels, standing in dynamic, stylized poses around a vertical, glowing light tube that casts a bright, cool-toned light. The reflective floor beneath them mirrors the vivid hues, enhancing the atmosphere with a striking visual effect. As the camera smoothly tilts downward, it transitions from the women's poised figures to focus on their lower legs and feet, highlighting the sleek, fashion-shoot aesthetic. One woman wears a black prosthetic leg, featuring a glossy carbon fiber weave, paired with a black heeled shoe. This deliberate camera movement emphasizes the prosthetic as the focal point, seamlessly connecting the initial broader view with the detailed shot of the footwear.",
