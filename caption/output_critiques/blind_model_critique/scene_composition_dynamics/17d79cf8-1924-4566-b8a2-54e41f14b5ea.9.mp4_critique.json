    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down at a construction task taking place outdoors during the day. On a patch of uneven dirt ground, a person's hands press a rectangular, red-orange brick into a line of similar bricks held together by wet, dark gray mortar. A taut white string is stretched along the row of bricks, acting as a guide. The person's legs, clad in patterned shorts, are visible at the bottom of the view. Nearby, a green plastic bucket contains more mortar, and in the background, a coiled black hose and other construction debris are scattered near a concrete ledge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the basic construction task, but it misses several key details and actions that would be visible. The description omits the use of a metal trowel, which the person uses to scoop mortar from the green bucket and expertly spread it onto the brick line before placing the new brick. The description of the \"white string\" is also incomplete; it is not just resting on the stairs but is stretched tautly across the length of the wall, acting as a guide line for ensuring the bricks are level. The setting is slightly ambiguous; describing the location as an \"unfinished second-story terrace\" would better reconcile the \"second floor\" elevation with the \"uneven dirt ground\" base. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention that the person's hands are covered by thick, tan-colored work gloves, and the \"construction debris\" is more specific, including scattered wood offcuts and broken pieces of terracotta tile. The description captures a static moment, whereas the video shows the continuous, rhythmic motion of the hands working, with the camera view shifting slightly as the person adjusts their body.",
