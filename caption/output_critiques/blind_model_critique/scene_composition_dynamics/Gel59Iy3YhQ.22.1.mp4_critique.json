    "pre_caption": "A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art golf game set on a small, sandy island surrounded by turquoise water. The island features a central green with a yellow flag, several palm trees, and small bushes.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a scene from a pixel-art golf game. It correctly identifies the setting (sandy island), key objects (palm trees, green, flag), the subject's action (swinging a club), and the motion of the ball. The description of the heads-up display (HUD) is precise, capturing the exact text and information visible (\"6th hole,\" \"par 3,\" \"SHOVEL DIGGING WEDGE,\" \"PLUGGED\").\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It includes the point of view (\"top-down or oblique top-down\"), the environment (\"sandy island surrounded by turquoise water\"), notable visual elements (pixel-art style, yellow flag, green shirt), and a thorough breakdown of the overlay elements, including their content and placement on the screen.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the gaming perspective.\n    *   **Setting & Scenery:** It focuses on the environment, describing it clearly without making assumptions.\n    *   **Overlays:** It explicitly identifies the \"heads-up display\" as an overlay and meticulously describes its components in the top-left, top-right, and bottom sections, as requested.\n    *   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The language is objective and factual, avoiding words like \"appears\" or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Motion:** It describes the key motion in the scene: the character swinging and the ball flying.\n    *   **Simple Language:** The description uses clear, natural English.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is both detailed and objective.",
