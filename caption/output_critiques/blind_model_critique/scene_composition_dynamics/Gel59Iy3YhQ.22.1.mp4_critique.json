    "pre_caption": "A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art golf game set on a small, sandy island surrounded by turquoise water. The island features a central green with a yellow flag, several palm trees, and small bushes. A character in a green shirt swings a club, sending a white golf ball flying towards the hole on the green. The scene is framed by a heads-up display. In the top left, information about the hole indicates it is the 6th hole, a par 3, with player scores listed below. In the top right, indicators for wind and slope are visible. The bottom of the screen displays the selected club, a \"SHOVEL DIGGING WEDGE,\" a power meter, and information about the ball's lie, which is \"PLUGGED.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by clearly identifying the game's pixel-art style, the island setting, and the specific details of the heads-up display. However, it could be more precise and dynamic. The point of view is described as \"top-down or oblique top-down,\" which is ambiguous; specifying it as an oblique top-down view would better account for the visible sides of the palm trees and the character. The description lacks a sense of motion; the turquoise water likely has a subtle ripple animation, and the palm trees probably sway slightly, corresponding to the wind indicator mentioned in the HUD. Furthermore, the action sequence feels incomplete. While it describes the character swinging and the ball flying \"towards the hole,\" it omits the crucial conclusion of the shot—where the ball lands and the result. The description of the ball's lie as \"PLUGGED\" is presented after the swing, creating a slight logical confusion; it would be clearer to state this was the condition of the ball *before* the swing with the \"SHOVEL DIGGING WEDGE.\" Finally, the description misses a key visual element: the camera movement. After the ball is struck, the camera likely pans to follow its arc through the air and track it to its landing spot, a standard convention in golf games that significantly influences the viewing experience.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a pixel-art golf game with an oblique top-down view, set on a small, sandy island surrounded by subtly rippling turquoise water. The island features a central green with a yellow flag, several palm trees swaying gently in the wind, and small bushes. A character in a green shirt swings a club, sending a white golf ball flying towards the hole on the green. The camera dynamically pans to follow the ball's arc through the air, tracking it to its landing spot. The heads-up display frames the scene, with the top left indicating it's the 6th hole, a par 3, and player scores listed below. The top right shows indicators for wind and slope. At the bottom, the selected club, a \"SHOVEL DIGGING WEDGE,\" is displayed alongside a power meter and information about the ball's lie, which was \"PLUGGED\" before the swing.",
