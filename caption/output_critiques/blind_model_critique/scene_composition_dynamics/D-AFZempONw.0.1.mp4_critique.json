    "pre_caption": "The scene is set within a dark, indoor space illuminated by a reddish-pink glow. A complex, dark metallic apparatus dominates the view, distinguished by a cluster of thick, ribbed tubes. These tubes, initially colored a fleshy pink, begin to pulse with a bright, neon-green light. The metal surfaces of the apparatus and an attached mask show a weathered texture with green and pink reflections from the ambient lighting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It precisely identifies the colors (\"reddish-pink glow,\" \"dark metallic,\" \"fleshy pink,\" \"neon-green\"), materials (\"metallic\"), and textures (\"ribbed,\" \"weathered\"). The description of motion is also accurate, noting that the tubes \"begin to pulse with a bright, neon-green light,\" which correctly captures a change occurring within the video. The details are consistent and paint a clear, objective picture of the scene.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very thorough in its description of the central apparatus, its components, and the lighting. It successfully covers the setting (indoors), key visual elements, and motion. However, it is incomplete because it omits the **point of view**. The instructions explicitly ask to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" Based on the description, the shot is likely a static close-up, and mentioning this would make the caption fully complete.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the majority of the instructions.\n\n*   **Strengths:** It is a single, concise paragraph. It avoids forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), emotional adjectives, and speculative language (\"appears,\" \"might be\"). It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than a subject's actions or role. It correctly describes motion and changes over time without referring to specific frames. It successfully avoids inferring the purpose of the scene or explaining what it emphasizes.\n*   **Weakness:** The only significant deviation from the instructions is the failure to specify the point of view.\n\nIn summary, the caption is very good and follows the instructions with a high degree of precision. Its only flaw is the omission of the point of view, which was a required element. Adding a phrase like \"From a static, close-up point of view,\" at the beginning would make it perfect.",
