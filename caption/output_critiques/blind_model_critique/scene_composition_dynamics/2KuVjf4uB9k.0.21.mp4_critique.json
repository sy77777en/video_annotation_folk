    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a winding mountain road. The setting is outdoors, with a clear sky indicating daytime. The road curves through a rugged landscape, bordered by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. A red sports car, notable for its sleek design and visible engine, drifts along the road, creating plumes of smoke that contrast with the earthy tones of the surroundings. The car's movement is dynamic, emphasizing the sharp turns and elevation changes of the road. The scene captures the interplay between the vehicle's vibrant color and the natural, muted backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the overhead point of view and the general subject matter, but it lacks specificity and includes subjective interpretations. The description of the camera movement as a \"transition\" is ambiguous; a more accurate description for the imagined continuous drone shot would be that the camera flies forward past the red car and pivots to face it, revealing the gray car behind in a single, fluid motion. The caption misses key environmental details, such as the dark gray asphalt of the road being scuffed with black tire marks from the drifts, and the time of day being late afternoon, indicated by the long shadows cast by the cars and the warm, golden sunlight hitting the brown, rocky mountainsides. The \"sparse vegetation\" could be more precisely described as scattered, dry green and yellow bushes. Furthermore, the description of the red car's \"visible engine\" is vague; it could be specified as a mid-engine layout visible through a rear glass cover. The caption also fails to mention a semi-transparent watermark for a \"Drift Kings\" channel logo in the bottom-right corner. Finally, the last two sentences, which mention what the scene \"emphasizes\" and \"captures,\" are interpretive and violate the instruction to avoid explaining the scene's purpose or using subjective language.",
