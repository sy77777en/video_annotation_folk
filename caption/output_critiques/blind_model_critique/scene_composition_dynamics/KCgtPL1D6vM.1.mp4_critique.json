    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It correctly identifies the specific location (\"Lisbon, Portugal,\" \"RUA DA MADALENA\"), the branding on the tram (\"carris,\" \"MONKEY 47\"), and the colors and materials of the surrounding environment (yellow and stone facades, iron-railed balconies).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and covers nearly all the required elements:\n*   **Setting:** Clearly identified as an \"outdoor scene in Lisbon, Portugal\" on a \"narrow street with tram tracks.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** \"Daytime\" and \"overcast sky\" are both included.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It effectively describes the buildings, street sign, and trams, including their colors, materials, and specific markings.\n*   **Subjects & Motion:** It includes pedestrians, a scooter, and two trams, noting the movement of the foreground tram (\"moves across the foreground\").\n*   **Point of View:** The only element missing is the point of view (e.g., \"From an eye-level perspective...\"). While not a major omission, including it would make the description even more thorough as per the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich, detailed description in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"charming,\" \"it seems\").\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The focus remains on the overall scene, with subjects like pedestrians and trams described in a way that complements the setting rather than becoming the main focus.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n*   **Prohibited Terms:** It correctly avoids terms like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or any language that infers purpose or emphasis.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is very good. It is a well-written, factual, and detailed description that captures the essence of the scene while strictly following the provided guidelines. The only minor improvement would be to add the point of view to make it fully compliant with every aspect of the instructions.",
