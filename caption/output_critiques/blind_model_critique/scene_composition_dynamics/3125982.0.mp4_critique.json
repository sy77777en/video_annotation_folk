    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a gym setting with a focus on a wooden floor. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light streaming in, casting soft shadows across the floor. The environment is spacious, with exercise equipment visible in the background, indicating an area dedicated to fitness activities. The floor is smooth and polished, with a warm, natural wood tone. The scene captures a person engaged in a workout, wearing athletic attire, including gloves and shorts, with movements suggesting physical exercise. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, emphasizing activity and motion within the gym space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n**What the caption does correctly:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It correctly identifies the setting as an indoor gym and the time of day as daytime.\n*   It describes the material and appearance of a notable visual element (the smooth, polished wooden floor).\n*   It avoids using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n\n1.  **Missing Point of View:** The instructions require specifying the point of view (e.g., static shot, low-angle, handheld). The caption omits this crucial detail.\n2.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The caption uses \"The lighting **suggests** daytime\" and \"movements **suggesting** physical exercise.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements. It should state what is visible directly (e.g., \"The scene is lit by natural daytime light,\" \"a person performs physical exercises\").\n3.  **Inference and Interpretation:**\n    *   The phrase \"...with exercise equipment visible in the background, **indicating an area dedicated to fitness activities**\" is an inference about the setting's role, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   The statement \"The overall atmosphere is **dynamic**, **emphasizing activity and motion**...\" is a direct violation of the rules to avoid emotional/subjective adjectives (\"dynamic\") and to not explain what the scene \"emphasizes.\"\n    *   Saying the scene has \"a **focus on** a wooden floor\" is an interpretation of the shot's composition, which should be avoided in favor of a direct description.\n4.  **Improper Focus:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\" While the caption starts with the setting, the final two sentences shift focus to the person's activity and the \"atmosphere,\" which contradicts the primary directive.",
