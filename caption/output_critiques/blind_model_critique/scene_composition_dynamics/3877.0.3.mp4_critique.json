    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a mountainous region, characterized by rugged terrain and distant peaks under a cloudy sky. The environment suggests a cool, overcast day, with muted natural colors dominating the scene. The landscape features rolling hills and valleys, providing a sense of vastness and isolation. The focus is on a person positioned prominently in the foreground, wearing a light-colored cap and layered clothing, which includes a dark shirt with a yellow undershirt. The person's posture and expression suggest engagement with the surroundings. The overall atmosphere is serene and contemplative, with the natural backdrop providing a dramatic contrast to the human presence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual details described (a person in a mountainous region under a cloudy sky) are present in the video, the caption is factually accurate in its description of the physical elements. It correctly identifies the setting, weather, and the subject's presence.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several key details requested by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It does not specify the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, drone shot), which is a required element if relevant.\n*   **Motion:** It fails to describe any motion, such as wind, camera movement, or movement from the subject.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention whether there are any overlay elements like text, watermarks, or icons.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It violates multiple core rules outlined in the instructions.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses words like \"serene,\" \"contemplative,\" and \"dramatic.\" These describe a mood or feeling, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption includes phrases like \"suggests a cool, overcast day\" and \"The person's posture and expression suggest engagement with the surroundings.\" This is inferential and speculative, directly contradicting the instructions.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption states, \"The focus is on a person...\" and \"...the natural backdrop providing a dramatic contrast to the human presence.\" These statements explain the compositional focus and artistic effect, which is explicitly disallowed. The phrase \"providing a sense of vastness and isolation\" also falls into this category.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** While the subject's placement is mentioned, the description of their clothing (\"dark shirt with a yellow undershirt\") and especially their \"expression\" goes into more detail than necessary, shifting focus away from the scenery.\n\nIn summary, the caption reads more like a subjective interpretation or an artistic analysis of the scene rather than the objective, factual description required by the instructions. It consistently injects emotion, speculation, and commentary on the scene's focus, all of which were explicitly prohibited.",
