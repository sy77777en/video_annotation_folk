    "pre_caption": "The video, observed from an objective viewpoint, unfolds against a stark white background. A vibrant green, grass-like surface slopes upwards from the bottom of the frame, upon which a black and white soccer ball is visible. An anime-style male character, identifiable by white hair and a dark athletic uniform with a white number \"7\", appears in a dynamic, mid-action pose on this green surface, positioned near the soccer ball.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subjects and the progressive reveal of the scene, but it lacks specificity regarding the point of view and the nature of the motion. The video is presented from a side-angle, medium tracking shot that follows the ball, a detail that would provide important context for the viewer. The description of the ball \"moving through the air\" is too general; in the video, the ball is spinning rapidly with a visible motion blur, arcing downwards towards the character who is not just in a \"dynamic pose\" but is specifically frozen at the apex of a volley kick, with one leg extended. The phrase \"gradually come into view\" is also vague; the reveal happens as the camera tilts down with the ball, bringing the ground plane and the waiting character into the shot from the bottom edge. Furthermore, the caption focuses heavily on the character's appearance while the instruction asks to prioritize the setting. The \"grass-like surface\" could be more definitively described as a stylized, artificial-looking turf of a soccer pitch, complete with a solid white boundary line that becomes visible near the character's feet. The soccer ball itself has a distinct black and white hexagonal pattern with a subtle blue energy trail, a notable visual element that is omitted.",
