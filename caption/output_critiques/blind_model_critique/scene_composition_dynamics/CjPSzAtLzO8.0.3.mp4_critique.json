    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a fast-moving, blurry view of a vehicle on a paved road before pulling back to reveal a wider, high-angle perspective. The scene is set in a vast desert landscape under a clear, light blue sky. A dark asphalt racetrack curves through the beige, sandy terrain, which is marked with tire tracks alongside the road. In the distance, a range of brown, rocky mountains lines the horizon. Two vehicles are visible driving along the track in this expansive, arid environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres to the majority of the instructions. It successfully creates a clear and objective picture of the video's content and flow.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the point of view as a drone, the camera movement from a close-up to a wide shot, the environment as a desert, and the key elements within it, such as the racetrack, mountains, and vehicles. The description of colors and textures (e.g., \"dark asphalt,\" \"beige, sandy terrain,\" \"brown, rocky mountains\") is precise.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but has one minor omission:\n\n*   **Time of Day:** The instruction requires stating the time of day. The caption implies it is daytime with \"clear, light blue sky,\" but it does not state it explicitly (e.g., \"during the day\"). This is the only significant piece of missing information.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption demonstrates an excellent understanding of and adherence to the detailed instructions.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Point of View and Motion:** It correctly identifies the \"drone\" POV and describes the camera's motion (\"pulling back to reveal a wider, high-angle perspective\"), effectively explaining the scene transition.\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It clearly establishes the setting as an \"outdoors\" \"desert landscape\" and describes its features without making assumptions about the specific location, as instructed.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"dramatic\") and speculative language (\"it appears,\" \"might be\"). It uses descriptive but objective words like \"vast\" and \"expansive.\"\n*   **Element Description:** It provides concise yet informative details about the color, material, and features of notable elements (the \"dark asphalt racetrack,\" \"beige, sandy terrain,\" \"tire tracks\").\n*   **Subject Description:** The vehicles are mentioned in context (\"driving along the track\") without excessive detail, perfectly following the guideline.\n*   **Formatting and Structure:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, exactly as requested. It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"",
