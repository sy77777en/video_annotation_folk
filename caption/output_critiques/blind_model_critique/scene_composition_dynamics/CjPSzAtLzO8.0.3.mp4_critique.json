    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a fast-moving, blurry view of a vehicle on a paved road before pulling back to reveal a wider, high-angle perspective. The scene is set in a vast desert landscape under a clear, light blue sky. A dark asphalt racetrack curves through the beige, sandy terrain, which is marked with tire tracks alongside the road. In the distance, a range of brown, rocky mountains lines the horizon. Two vehicles are visible driving along the track in this expansive, arid environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the drone's movement from a close, blurry shot to a wide, high-angle view, but it could be more specific to better reflect the visual details of the scene. The initial description of a \"fast-moving, blurry view\" could be enhanced by specifying the point of view, such as a low-angle tracking shot closely following the vehicles from behind. The description of the desert as \"beige, sandy terrain\" is somewhat generic; the video likely shows sparse, dry scrub brush or other hardy vegetation, which would add texture and realism to the landscape. The \"tire tracks alongside the road\" could be more precisely described as dark skid marks curving in the sand off the track's corners, suggesting aggressive driving. While the caption identifies the \"asphalt racetrack,\" it misses key defining features like the red-and-white painted curbing on the turns or a visible start/finish line. The description of the \"two vehicles\" is too vague; specifying them as \"two sports cars\" would provide important context without excessive detail. Finally, the caption omits the quality of the light, such as \"bright, direct sunlight casting short, hard shadows,\" which would better establish the arid atmosphere and time of day.",
