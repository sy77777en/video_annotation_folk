    "pre_caption": "The video captures a dramatic scene at an airport during nighttime, with a locked-on POV shot fixed to an aircraft. The setting is outdoors, featuring a large airplane adjacent to a hangar. The environment is illuminated by bright lights on the hangar, casting reflections on the wet tarmac. A significant explosion occurs, with flames and thick black smoke engulfing the wing of the aircraft. The fire's intense orange and yellow hues contrast with the dark night sky. The hangar's structure is modern, with large glass panels and metal framing. The scene transitions from the initial explosion to the aftermath, where smoke continues to billow, partially obscuring the view of the hangar and the aircraft. The fixed perspective emphasizes the unfolding chaos and destruction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in terms of its structure and descriptive detail, but it fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints outlined in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate in its description of the visual events. It logically portrays a scene of an explosion on an aircraft wing at an airport at night. The details provided—such as the wet tarmac, hangar lights, and the color of the flames—are specific and create a clear, factual picture of the event as it would likely appear in a video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and successfully incorporates most of the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly identified as a \"locked-on POV shot fixed to an aircraft.\"\n*   **Setting:** Specified as \"outdoors\" at an \"airport\" with a \"hangar.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Stated as \"nighttime.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Describes the hangar (\"large glass panels and metal framing\"), the ground (\"wet tarmac\"), and the fire (\"orange and yellow hues,\" \"thick black smoke\").\n*   **Motion/Changes:** Effectively describes the \"explosion\" and the subsequent \"billowing smoke.\" It also correctly notes the transition from the event to its \"aftermath.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has significant weaknesses. While it follows many rules, it directly violates several key prohibitions.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It combines details from across the video without referring to specific frames.\n*   It avoids speculative language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   It correctly identifies the setting, POV, and time of day.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses several words that impart emotion, judgment, or subjective interpretation.\n    *   **\"dramatic scene\"**: \"Dramatic\" is an emotional interpretation of the event.\n    *   **\"significant explosion\"**: \"Significant\" is a subjective judgment of the explosion's scale.\n    *   **\"intense orange and yellow hues\"**: \"Intense\" is a subjective descriptor of the color's quality.\n    *   **\"unfolding chaos and destruction\"**: \"Chaos\" and \"destruction\" are highly emotional and interpretive terms.\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final sentence is a direct violation of this rule.\n    *   **\"The fixed perspective emphasizes the unfolding chaos and destruction.\"**: This sentence explicitly analyzes the cinematic effect of the POV, which the instructions forbid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is factually strong and structurally complete, but its failure to remain objective is a major flaw. It successfully describes *what* is happening but violates the instructions by adding subjective analysis of *how* it feels (\"dramatic,\" \"chaos\") and what the shot \"emphasizes.\" To be compliant, all subjective adjectives and the final analytical sentence would need to be removed.",
