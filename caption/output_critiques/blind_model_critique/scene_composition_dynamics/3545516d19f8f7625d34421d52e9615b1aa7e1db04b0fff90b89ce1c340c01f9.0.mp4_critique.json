    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive coastal landscape during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a prominent white lighthouse with a red top situated on a rocky shoreline. Surrounding the lighthouse are a few small buildings with red roofs, nestled among green trees. The coastline curves gently, bordered by a vast, calm blue sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. A tall communication tower stands nearby, adding a vertical element to the scene. The clear sky and bright sunlight enhance the natural colors, creating a serene and picturesque view of the coastal environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully captures the main visual elements but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and misses one important aspect of the video.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the physical elements is highly accurate. The video does show a drone shot of a coastal landscape with a white lighthouse (red top), small buildings (red roofs), a rocky shoreline, a calm blue sea, a dense forest, and a communication tower, all under a clear, sunny sky.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Good:** The caption correctly identifies the point of view (\"filmed by a drone\"), setting (\"outdoors,\" \"coastal landscape\"), time of day (\"during the day\"), and notable visual elements with their colors and shapes.\n*   **Incomplete:** The most significant omission is the **lack of any description of motion**. The instruction states, \"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe... human-made movements.\" The video is not a static shot; the drone is actively moving, panning, and circling the lighthouse to reveal different angles of the landscape. This dynamic movement is a defining characteristic of the video and should have been included.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violated - Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using \"serene\" and \"picturesque.\" These words describe a feeling or an opinion about the scene rather than an objective fact.\n*   **Violated - Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption includes two phrases that break this rule:\n    1.  \"...adding a vertical element to the scene.\" This is an interpretive comment on the tower's role in the composition.\n    2.  \"...creating a serene and picturesque view of the coastal environment.\" This explains the overall effect or highlight of the scene.\n*   **Followed:** The caption correctly avoids referring to specific frames, focuses on the setting, uses simple English, and is formatted as a single paragraph without introductory text. It also correctly avoids speculation.\n\n### Summary:\n\nWhile the caption provides a factually accurate list of the scene's contents, it fails by describing a dynamic video as a static picture, and it violates the negative constraints by including subjective and interpretive language. A better caption would incorporate the drone's movement and remove the subjective commentary.",
