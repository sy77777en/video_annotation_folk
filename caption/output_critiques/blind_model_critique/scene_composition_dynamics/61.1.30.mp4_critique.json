    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit ambiance, likely during the evening. The environment features a room with striped curtains and a hanging light fixture that casts a soft glow. The walls and decor suggest a retro or vintage style, with muted colors and a cozy atmosphere. A person is present, wearing a white uniform and a hat, adding to the nostalgic feel of the scene. The lighting creates a mix of shadows and highlights, enhancing the intimate and slightly mysterious mood of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\n*   **Video Content:** A static, eye-level shot from inside a vintage diner booth at night. The booth has red vinyl seats and a chrome-edged laminate table. Outside the window, the blurry lights of passing cars are visible. The walls are dark wood-paneled. A person in a white soda jerk uniform and paper hat stands beside the booth, partially in shadow. A single, bare bulb in a fluted glass shade hangs overhead, casting a focused, warm yellow light. A semi-transparent watermark is in the bottom-right corner.\n\n***\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the dimly lit, vintage-style interior and the presence of a person in uniform, but it lacks the specificity and objectivity required. The description of an \"indoor setting\" is too general; the scene is clearly a booth in a vintage diner, a detail established by the red vinyl seating and wood-paneled walls, which are not mentioned. The caption fails to describe the material and color of key elements, such as the faded red and cream of the \"striped curtains\" or the specific nature of the \"hanging light fixture,\" which is a single bulb in a fluted glass shade. It uses prohibited subjective terms like \"warm,\" \"cozy,\" and \"nostalgic,\" and speculates on the time of day (\"likely during the evening\") when the dark exterior and blurry car lights visible through the window confirm it is night. Furthermore, the caption omits the static, eye-level point of view and fails to mention the semi-transparent watermark present in the bottom-right corner.",
