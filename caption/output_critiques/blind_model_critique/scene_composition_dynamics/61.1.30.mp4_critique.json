    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit ambiance, likely during the evening. The environment features a room with striped curtains and a hanging light fixture that casts a soft glow. The walls and decor suggest a retro or vintage style, with muted colors and a cozy atmosphere. A person is present, wearing a white uniform and a hat, adding to the nostalgic feel of the scene. The lighting creates a mix of shadows and highlights, enhancing the intimate and slightly mysterious mood of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Use of Subjective and Emotional Language:** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using words and phrases like \"warm... ambiance,\" \"soft glow,\" \"cozy atmosphere,\" \"nostalgic feel,\" and \"intimate and slightly mysterious mood.\" These terms describe feelings and interpretations rather than objective visual facts.\n\n*   **Inference and Speculation:** The instructions say to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The caption includes several instances of speculation and inference:\n    *   \"**likely** during the evening\" is speculative.\n    *   \"walls and decor **suggest** a retro or vintage style\" is an inference.\n    *   \"**adding to the nostalgic feel** of the scene\" infers the effect of the subject.\n    *   \"**enhancing the intimate and slightly mysterious mood**\" is an interpretation of what the lighting does, which the instructions forbid (\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\").\n\n*   **Missing Required Information:** The caption omits several details requested in the instructions:\n    *   It does not mention the **point of view** (e.g., eye-level, high-angle).\n    *   It fails to describe any **motion or changes** within the scene, which is a critical component of a video description.\n    *   It does not mention if there are any **overlay elements** like text or watermarks.\n\n*   **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The instructions ask to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"The video depicts,\" which is an unnecessary introductory phrase.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it is highly interpretive and subjective, uses speculative language, and omits mandatory descriptive elements like point of view and motion. It focuses more on creating a mood than on providing a clear, objective description of the visual information as required by the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An indoor setting with dim lighting features a room with striped curtains and a hanging light fixture.
