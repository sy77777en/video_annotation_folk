    "pre_caption": "A macro view captures a weevil positioned on a vibrant green leaf. The insect has a dark, textured exoskeleton with a golden-brown coloration and a pitted surface. Its head features large, dark compound eyes and a long, prominent snout extending downwards. The leaf beneath it is smooth, with a few small white specks visible on its surface. The scene is illuminated by bright, direct light, which creates distinct highlights on the weevil's body and legs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw regarding its adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies the subject as a weevil and provides precise details about its physical characteristics (\"dark, textured exoskeleton,\" \"golden-brown coloration,\" \"pitted surface,\" \"long, prominent snout\"). The description of the leaf (\"vibrant green,\" \"smooth,\" \"small white specks\") and the lighting (\"bright, direct light,\" \"distinct highlights\") is also accurate and specific. The use of \"macro view\" correctly identifies the point of view.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption describes a static scene. If the video includes any motion—such as the weevil walking, its antennae twitching, the leaf swaying, or the camera's focus shifting—the caption would be incomplete for failing to mention these changes. It correctly omits details that are not visible, such as the time of day or the broader environment beyond the leaf, thereby avoiding speculation as instructed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n**Strengths:**\n*   It successfully provides a concise, informative description using simple, natural English.\n*   It correctly identifies the point of view (\"macro view\").\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and speculative language like \"it appears.\"\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It follows the single-paragraph format without any introductory text.\n*   It describes color, texture, and shape as requested.\n\n**Weakness:**\n*   The primary failure is its focus. The instruction explicitly states, \"**Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.**\" This caption does the opposite. The majority of the description is dedicated to the weevil (the subject), while the leaf (the setting/scenery) receives minimal attention. The level of detail on the weevil is extensive, which contradicts the instruction to keep subject descriptions complementary to the scene \"without excessive detail.\" A better caption would have shifted the focus more toward the leaf and its context, treating the weevil as an element within that scene rather than the main point of focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A vibrant green leaf serves as the backdrop, its smooth surface dotted with small white specks. Bright, direct light illuminates the scene, casting distinct highlights across the leaf's texture. Resting on the leaf is a weevil, its presence adding a touch of life to the setting. The weevil's dark, textured exoskeleton and golden-brown coloration subtly contrast with the leaf's vivid hue, while its long snout and large, dark eyes are visible under the bright lighting.",
