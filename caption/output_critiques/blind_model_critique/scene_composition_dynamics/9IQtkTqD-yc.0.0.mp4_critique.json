    "pre_caption": "The scene is viewed through a night vision device, casting the entire landscape in a grainy, green monochrome and framed by a dark, circular vignette. The setting is a rural area at night. A light source intermittently flashes, illuminating a dirt road that stretches toward a dark treeline in the background. When the light is on, a small shed is visible on the right side of the road, and a fence line with weeds is on the left. A prominent, gnarled, leafless tree stands silhouetted against the sky, next to a leafy tree. The light source turns on and off, alternately revealing and obscuring the details of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It masterfully adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate based on the visual details it describes. It creates a clear and consistent mental image of the scene: a night-vision view of a rural road where a flashing light reveals and hides elements. The descriptions of the green monochrome, grainy texture, circular vignette, and specific objects like the gnarled tree and shed are precise and factual.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, successfully incorporating all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly identified as \"viewed through a night vision device.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Specified as a \"rural area at night\" with descriptive features like a \"dirt road,\" \"treeline,\" \"shed,\" and \"fence line.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Stated as \"at night.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It details the night vision effect (\"grainy, green monochrome,\" \"dark, circular vignette\") and key landscape features (\"gnarled, leafless tree,\" \"leafy tree\").\n*   **Motion/Changes:** The core action of the \"light source intermittently flashes\" and its effect (\"alternately revealing and obscuring the details\") is described perfectly.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery, describing the placement of objects (\"shed is visible on the right,\" \"fence line... on the left\") without excessive detail.\n*   It strictly avoids all forbidden elements: there are no emotional or subjective adjectives, no speculative language (\"appears to be,\" \"might be\"), no references to \"frames\" or \"images,\" and no inference about the purpose or mood of the scene.\n*   The description of the night vision effect and the circular vignette is handled as a property of the point of view, which aligns perfectly with the instruction to describe visual elements and framing.\n*   The description of the flashing light is dynamic, explaining the overall change rather than a static, frame-by-frame account.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is observed through a night vision device, enveloping the entire landscape in a grainy, green monochrome and bordered by a dark, circular vignette. Set in a rural area at night, a light source intermittently flashes, illuminating a dirt road that extends toward a dark treeline in the background. When the light is on, a small shed becomes visible on the right side of the road, while a fence line with weeds appears on the left.
