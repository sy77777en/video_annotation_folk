    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It is a well-executed example of following the provided instructions.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the specific location as \"Ryan Field,\" the sport as American football, and the team mascot as \"WILDCATS.\" The descriptions of the field markings (white lines, purple \"N\" logo), player uniforms (white and dark), and the overcast weather conditions are precise and factual. The detail about the stadium lights being on during the day is an astute observation that adds to the accuracy of the scene's description.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very comprehensive and covers all the required elements.\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"high-angle, panning shot\" and includes a foreground element (\"back of a spectator's head\") that grounds the perspective.\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It clearly states the setting is an \"American football stadium\" and names it, noting it is \"crowded\" and outdoors.\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** It specifies an \"overcast day\" with a \"grey sky.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It details the turf, logos, stadium architecture (\"tan building,\" \"light towers\"), and surrounding environment (\"green trees and distant buildings\").\n*   **Subjects:** It includes the players and spectators with appropriate, non-excessive detail about their placement and appearance.\n*   **Motion:** It effectively describes the camera's \"panning\" motion and what this movement reveals.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption perfectly adheres to the stylistic and content rules.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It avoids subjective or emotional language (e.g., \"exciting,\" \"beautiful\").\n*   It refrains from speculation (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   It focuses on describing the setting and scenery, as instructed, rather than the action.\n*   It logically organizes the details, starting with a wide view and then focusing on specific elements like the field, stands, and the pan.\n*   It correctly avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model response that is accurate, thorough, and strictly follows all constraints of the prompt, resulting in a clear and objective description of the video.",
