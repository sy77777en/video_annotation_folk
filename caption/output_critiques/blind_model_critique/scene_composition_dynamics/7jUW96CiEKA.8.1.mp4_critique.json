    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene at the edge of a calm body of water with greenish, reflective water. A bank covered in dense green grass and some taller, drier reeds runs along the water's edge. A white egret with a long yellow beak is positioned amongst the grass on the bank. Initially, the bird is crouched low, looking down towards the water. It then makes a quick upward movement before settling back into a standing posture on the grassy bank. The scene occurs during daylight hours.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved by including the point of view and refining the introductory phrasing to better align with the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is accurate in its description of the scene. It correctly identifies the environment (edge of a body of water), the elements within it (green grass, reeds, water), their properties (greenish, reflective water), the subject (white egret with a yellow beak), and its actions (crouching, moving upward, standing).\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Information:** The caption fails to mention the **point of view**. The instructions explicitly state to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" A description like \"From a static, eye-level point of view\" would have fulfilled this requirement.\n*   **Well-Covered:** The caption successfully includes the setting (outdoors, by water), time of day (daylight), notable visual elements (colors of water, grass, and bird), and the motion of the subject.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and speculative language like \"it appears.\"\n    *   It uses simple, objective, and natural English.\n    *   It successfully describes motion by detailing the bird's movement over time.\n    *   It focuses on descriptive details like color (\"greenish,\" \"white,\" \"yellow\") and texture (\"dense green grass\").\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Point of View:** This is the most significant deviation from the instructions. The POV is a required element that was omitted.\n    *   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video captures...\" While not explicitly forbidden, the instructions favor a more direct description of the scene itself. A stronger opening would integrate the point of view and describe the scene directly, such as: \"From a static, eye-level point of view, an outdoor scene is set at the edge of a calm body of water...\" This removes the meta-reference to \"the video\" and immediately grounds the viewer in the scene.",
