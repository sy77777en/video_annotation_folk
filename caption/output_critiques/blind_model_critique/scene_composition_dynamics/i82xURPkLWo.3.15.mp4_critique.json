    "pre_caption": "The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body in a rustic indoor setting. The room features large windows that offer a view of a vast, open landscape with golden fields stretching to the horizon under a clear sky, suggesting daytime. The interior includes worn wooden walls and a mix of vintage and eclectic furniture, such as leather chairs and a wooden desk. Potted plants and a standing lamp add to the cozy atmosphere. The scene captures a blend of natural and man-made elements, with the expansive outdoor view contrasting the intimate, lived-in feel of the room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and contains significant errors in terminology and structure.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Inaccurate:** The caption uses the contradictory phrase \"third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot.\" An \"over-the-shoulder\" shot is a specific type of third-person shot. A \"Point of View\" (POV) shot simulates what a character sees, which is a first-person perspective. The two terms are mutually exclusive, making the description technically incorrect and confusing. The correct term would simply be \"an over-the-shoulder shot.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Incomplete:** The most significant omission is the complete lack of any description of **motion or change**. A video is a time-based medium, but the caption describes the scene as if it were a static photograph. It fails to mention if the character moves, if there is any movement outside (like wind in the fields), or if the camera itself pans, tilts, or moves. This is a critical failure for a video description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates multiple explicit negative constraints:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":**\n    *   The caption uses the word \"**cozy** atmosphere.\" \"Cozy\" is a subjective feeling.\n    *   It describes the room as having an \"**intimate, lived-in feel**.\" Both \"intimate\" and \"lived-in feel\" are subjective interpretations of the scene, not objective descriptions.\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":**\n    *   The caption states the view is \"...under a clear sky, **suggesting daytime**.\" The instruction forbids speculative language like \"suggesting.\" It should be stated directly as \"during the daytime.\"\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":**\n    *   The final sentence, \"The scene captures a blend of natural and man-made elements, with the expansive outdoor view **contrasting** the intimate, lived-in feel of the room,\" is entirely analytical. It explains a thematic contrast, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n\n4.  **Violation of \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text\":**\n    *   The caption begins with \"**The video presents...**\" This is introductory text that should have been omitted. The description should start directly with the scene itself (e.g., \"An over-the-shoulder shot shows...\").\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the caption successfully identifies some key visual elements like the setting, furniture, and outdoor view, it fails fundamentally by treating the video as a still image, using incorrect cinematic terminology, and including forbidden subjective, speculative, and analytical language. It directly contravenes at least four distinct rules laid out in the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An over-the-shoulder shot shows a character’s upper body in a rustic indoor setting with large windows revealing a vast landscape of golden fields under a clear sky during the daytime. The room features worn wooden walls and a mix of vintage furniture, including leather chairs and a wooden desk. Potted plants and a standing lamp are present. The video captures subtle movements: the character shifts slightly, the fields outside sway gently in the breeze, and the camera slowly pans to the right, enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene.",
