    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video. It is an excellent example of how to follow the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. Every element described is clearly visible in the video.\n*   **Environment:** The scene is indeed dark, outdoors at night, and filled with \"dense, swirling smoke.\"\n*   **Lighting:** A \"bright, white light source from the left\" accurately describes the primary illumination and its \"strong backlit effect.\"\n*   **Background Element:** The \"large, dark structure with a glowing red light\" is a precise and factual description of the object in the background.\n*   **Subject:** The \"person wearing a light-colored jacket\" who \"moves through the center\" is an accurate and concise summary of the subject's appearance and action.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully captures all the essential information required to understand the scene without being overly detailed.\n*   It establishes the setting, time of day, and atmosphere immediately.\n*   It includes the most significant visual elements: the smoke, the powerful light source, and the background structure.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the motion within the scene (\"swirling smoke\" and \"person... moves through\").\n*   It correctly omits any mention of overlays, specific locations, or scene transitions, as none are present.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the specific rules of the prompt exceptionally well.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full picture of the scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words, using neutral descriptors like \"dark,\" \"dense,\" \"bright,\" and \"large.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** It masterfully avoids guessing what the background object is, simply calling it a \"large, dark structure,\" which adheres strictly to the \"do not infer\" rule.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description prioritizes the atmospheric environment (smoke, light) over the person, as instructed. The person is described only in relation to their context within the scene.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text, markdown, or forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"it appears.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dark, outdoor setting at night, dense, swirling smoke fills the air, partially obscuring the view. A bright, white light from the left creates a striking backlit effect, illuminating the haze. Through the smoke, a large, dark structure with a glowing red light is visible in the background. A person in a light-colored jacket moves through the center of this foggy environment.",
