    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting during daylight, featuring a close-up view of a hand sketching on a small notepad. The notepad is held by another hand, and the sketch depicts a simple structure, possibly a building or tower, drawn with a dark pen. The background is blurred, suggesting a natural environment, possibly with earthy tones. The focus remains on the notepad and the sketching process, highlighting the texture of the paper and the movement of the pen. The scene maintains a neutral, observational perspective, emphasizing the act of drawing in a serene outdoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it correctly identifies some basic elements, it violates the rules against using speculative language, subjective adjectives, and explaining the scene's emphasis.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly forbids speculative statements like 'it appears,' 'might be,' or 'A or B.' The caption violates this rule multiple times:\n    *   \"...a simple structure, **possibly** a building or tower...\"\n    *   \"...**suggesting** a natural environment...\"\n    *   \"...**possibly** with earthy tones.\"\n    A good caption would describe only what is certain and visible.\n\n*   **Explaining Emphasis/Purpose:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption directly contradicts this:\n    *   \"...**highlighting** the texture of the paper...\"\n    *   \"...**emphasizing** the act of drawing...\"\n    The caption should describe the visual facts of the scene, not interpret the creator's intent or the scene's focus.\n\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption includes one:\n    *   \"...in a **serene** outdoor setting.\"\n    \"Serene\" is an emotional interpretation of the atmosphere, not a factual description.\n\n*   **Incomplete Description:** By using vague and speculative terms for the background (\"suggesting a natural environment, possibly with earthy tones\"), the caption fails to provide a concrete description of the visible colors or shapes, even if they are blurred.\n\n*   **Point of View:** The caption mentions a \"close-up view\" and \"observational perspective,\" which are stylistic interpretations rather than a clear description of the point of view (e.g., first-person, third-person).\n\n**A corrected version adhering to the instructions would look like this:**\n\nFrom a close-up perspective, an outdoor scene during daylight shows a hand using a dark pen to sketch on a small, white paper notepad held by another hand. The pen moves across the textured paper, creating a simple line drawing of a structure with a pointed roof. The background is out of focus, showing blurred green and brown tones.",
