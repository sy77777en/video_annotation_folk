    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is not good. While it captures some visual elements correctly, it fails to meet several key requirements of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the scene (dark, indoor, vertical structures with lines) and the figure (viewed from behind, suit color, helmet, arm device) is objective and fact-based.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy/Violation:** The phrase \"appear reflective or illuminated\" violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements (\"appears\") and ambiguous options (\"A or B\"). The instruction requires a definitive description of what is visible.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is significantly incomplete according to the instructions. It is missing several mandatory elements:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption mentions the figure is \"viewed from behind,\" but it does not state the overall camera POV as required (e.g., \"a static third-person shot,\" \"a slow tracking shot\").\n*   **Time of Day:** While it mentions a \"dark\" setting, this describes the lighting, not the time of day. The instruction explicitly asks for the time of day to be mentioned.\n*   **Motion or Changes:** This is a major omission. The instructions require a description of any motion (natural or human-made) or scene transitions. The caption describes a static scene (\"stands within\"), which is unlikely for a video. It fails to mention if the camera is moving, if the figure moves, or if the lights on the structures are changing.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to several specific rules:\n\n*   **Fails - Avoid Speculative Statements:** As mentioned, using \"appear\" is a direct violation of the rule: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n*   **Fails - Include All Required Elements:** It omits POV, time of day, and motion, which are all explicitly requested in the instructions.\n*   **Partial Fail - Subject Detail:** The instruction states to ensure subjects \"complement the scene without excessive detail\" and to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\" The description of the suit (\"grey and white suit with darker grey or black sections, including a helmet, and have a device mounted on their left forearm\") borders on excessive detail, shifting focus away from the scenery. A more compliant description might have been \"a figure in a grey and white suit and helmet.\"\n*   **Succeeds - Formatting and Tone:** The caption correctly avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" uses simple English, avoids emotional adjectives, does not infer the setting's role, and is presented as a single paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a poor execution of the instructions because it omits multiple required categories of information (POV, time of day, motion) and violates specific negative constraints (no speculative language, no ambiguity). It provides a basic visual summary but does not fulfill the comprehensive and precise requirements of the prompt.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a static third-person shot in a dark, indoor environment filled with tall, vertical structures that have numerous parallel, horizontal lines, which are reflective and illuminated, casting intricate patterns of light and shadow. It is nighttime, enhancing the darkness of the setting. A figure stands motionless within this space, wearing a grey and white suit with a helmet, and a device is mounted on their left forearm. The scene remains static, with no visible movement from the figure or changes in the lighting.",
