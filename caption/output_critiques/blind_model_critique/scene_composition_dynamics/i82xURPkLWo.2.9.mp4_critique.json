    "pre_caption": "In an outdoor setting, several bonsai trees rest on a wooden surface. In the foreground, a deciduous bonsai with small green leaves and a thick, gnarled trunk sits in a dark rectangular pot. To its right are two evergreen bonsai, one with dark green foliage and a twisted trunk, and another with a lighter, weathered trunk and exposed roots. The background, seen past a wooden railing, is a blurred natural landscape of trees and open land under an overcast sky. The view tilts upward to reveal a person in a reddish-brown shirt working on a wooden structure behind the trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the camera movement, but it could be more specific to better capture the scene's details. The point of view is omitted; specifying it as a handheld shot would clarify the smooth but personal nature of the upward tilt. The \"outdoor setting\" and \"wooden surface\" are too general; describing it as a \"wooden workbench on a covered deck\" would provide more context. While the main bonsai is well-described, the \"two bonsai trees to the left\" could be detailed further, for instance, as \"smaller juniper bonsai in blue ceramic pots.\" The description of the person is minimal; instead of just \"working on a wooden structure,\" it could be more descriptive, such as \"sanding a large overhead beam of a wooden pergola,\" which adds context without being overly detailed. The caption also misses potential ambient details like small gardening tools (shears, a wire roll) resting on the workbench near the pots, and it fails to describe the material of the dark rectangular pot, which could be specified as \"matte black ceramic.\" Finally, the transition feels slightly abrupt; framing the camera's upward movement as a slow tilt that reveals the person would create a more cohesive and descriptive narrative of the action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "On a covered deck, several bonsai trees rest on a wooden workbench. In the foreground, a deciduous bonsai with small green leaves and a thick, gnarled trunk sits in a matte black ceramic pot. To its right are two smaller juniper bonsai in blue ceramic pots, each with distinct features: one with dark green foliage and a twisted trunk, and another with a lighter, weathered trunk and exposed roots. Small gardening tools, including shears and a wire roll, are scattered on the workbench near the pots. The background, seen past a wooden railing, is a blurred natural landscape of trees and open land under an overcast sky. The handheld camera smoothly tilts upward, revealing a person in a reddish-brown shirt sanding a large overhead beam of a wooden pergola behind the trees, adding a personal touch to the scene.",
