The scene features a dimly lit room with a soft, amber glow, highlighting a small Ferris wheel model made of metal beams.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several core requirements of the instruction, particularly the negative constraints against using subjective language and inferring mood or intent.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The factual descriptions of the objects (Ferris wheel model, teddy bear, toy car, carousel, patterned walls, carpeted floor) are likely accurate representations of the visual content.\n*   However, the caption heavily relies on interpretive and emotional descriptions (\"warm, nostalgic atmosphere,\" \"sense of stillness and contemplation,\" \"childhood wonder\"), which are not objective facts visible in the scene. The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is missing several key pieces of information requested by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It does not mention the POV (e.g., static shot, handheld, eye-level).\n*   **Time of Day:** It is not specified.\n*   **Object Details:** While it mentions the Ferris wheel is made of \"metal beams,\" it lacks further detail on the color, material, or texture of the other toys as instructed.\n*   **Motion:** It implies stillness but does not explicitly state whether the video is a static shot or if there is any movement (e.g., the Ferris wheel turning).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption is filled with subjective language.\n    *   **Examples:** \"warm, nostalgic atmosphere,\" \"soft, amber glow,\" \"playful yet serene environment,\" \"vintage aesthetic,\" \"quiet, reflective moment,\" \"childhood wonder.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption interprets the purpose of the lighting and object arrangement.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...amber glow, **highlighting** a small Ferris wheel model,\" \"...teddy bear sits... **creating a sense of stillness and contemplation**,\" \"...toys... **adding to the playful yet serene environment**,\" \"...patterns on the walls, **contributing to a vintage aesthetic**.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption makes an inference about the scene's mood.\n    *   **Example:** \"The overall ambiance **suggests** a quiet, reflective moment...\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The caption assigns an emotional role and aesthetic (\"vintage aesthetic,\" \"childhood wonder\") to the setting rather than just describing it factually.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption Following the Instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the scene is an indoor, dimly lit room. An amber light source illuminates a small, black Ferris wheel model made of metal, which stands on a carpeted floor. A brown, plush teddy bear sits on the floor in front of the Ferris wheel. Also on the floor are other toys, including a red toy car and a small carousel model. The walls in the background have a dark, intricate pattern.",
