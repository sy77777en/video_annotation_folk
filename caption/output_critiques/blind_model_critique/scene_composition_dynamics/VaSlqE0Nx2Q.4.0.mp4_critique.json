    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors in a windswept, open landscape dominated by tall, dry grasses and rolling sand dunes under a sky filled with scattered clouds. The environment is rendered in black and white, giving the scene a monochromatic appearance. The grasses in the foreground are thin, upright, and textured, with some bending in the wind, while the dunes in the background have smooth, undulating shapes with visible ridges and patches of vegetation. The lighting suggests daytime, with sunlight casting soft shadows across the terrain. A solitary figure is present, partially obscured by the grasses and later seen as a small silhouette traversing the expansive sandy area, emphasizing the scale of the natural surroundings. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption that captures the scene well, but it contains a few specific violations of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the rules:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It successfully paints a clear and coherent picture of the scene by describing the black-and-white landscape, the natural elements like dry grass and sand dunes, the presence of wind, and the movement of a solitary figure. The details about texture (\"thin, upright, and textured\" grass; \"smooth, undulating\" dunes) are precise and effective.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete, covering many of the required elements:\n*   **Environment/Setting:** Yes, \"outdoors in a windswept, open landscape.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Yes, \"daytime.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Yes, it describes the grasses, dunes, and monochromatic style.\n*   **Subjects:** Yes, it describes the \"solitary figure\" and its context.\n*   **Motion:** Yes, it mentions the \"windswept\" landscape, grass \"bending in the wind,\" and the figure \"traversing\" the area.\n*   **Overlays:** Yes, it correctly notes their absence.\n\nHowever, it is missing one key element:\n*   **Point of View:** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, panning shot, drone shot), which is a required component of the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has a few clear issues.\n\n**Violations:**\n1.  **Explaining Emphasis (Major Violation):** The instruction explicitly states, \"**Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.**\" The caption violates this rule with the phrase, \"**emphasizing the scale of the natural surroundings.**\" This is an interpretation of the scene's effect, not a direct description of its content.\n2.  **Using Introductory Text (Minor Violation):** The instruction says to return the description \"**without... introductory text.**\" The caption begins with \"**The video takes place...**\" which is an unnecessary introductory phrase. The description should begin directly, for example: \"Outdoors, a windswept, open landscape is dominated by...\"\n3.  **Using Speculative Language (Minor Violation):** The instruction says to \"**Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.**\" The phrase \"**The lighting suggests daytime**\" is borderline speculative. A more direct and confident statement, such as \"The lighting is consistent with daytime,\" or simply stating it is \"daytime,\" would adhere more strictly to the rule.\n\n**Good Adherence:**\n*   It correctly avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It successfully combines details from across the video's duration without referring to specific frames (e.g., \"partially obscured by the grasses and later seen as a small silhouette\").\n*   It is written as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It focuses on the setting over the subject, as instructed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is well-written and descriptive but fails on a few key negative constraints, most notably by interpreting the scene's emphasis. Removing the interpretive phrase, the introductory text, the speculative word, and adding the point of view would make it fully compliant with the instructions.",
