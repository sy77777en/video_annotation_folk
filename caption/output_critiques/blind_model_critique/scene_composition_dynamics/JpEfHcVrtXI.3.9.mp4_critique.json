    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the \"third-person 3D game video\" point of view, the \"small figure in a bright yellow raincoat,\" and the \"pitch-black indoor space.\"\n*   The description of the lighting is precise: the figure is the \"sole source of light,\" casting a \"moving circle of illumination.\"\n*   Details like the \"dark, planked floor,\" \"wet patches,\" and \"amorphous dark shapes\" are all factually correct and visible in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene. It includes the point of view, setting, key subject, lighting, environmental details, and motion (\"running\").\n*   It successfully combines details from the entire video into a single, coherent description without referencing specific moments.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as overlays, weather, or a specific time of day (which is irrelevant for a pitch-black indoor scene).\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and avoids unnecessary words.\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses neutral, descriptive language (\"bright yellow,\" \"pitch-black,\" \"amorphous\") and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"scary,\" \"eerie\").\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption avoids any speculation, such as what the dark shapes might be or why the character is running.\n*   **Focus:** It maintains focus on the setting and scenery, using the subject to complement the scene's description, as instructed.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n*   **Prohibited Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"",
