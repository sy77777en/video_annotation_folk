    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the figurines and the initial background, but it misinterprets the core visual element of the scene. The phrase \"the scene is actually seen through a train window\" is ambiguous and likely incorrect; the video probably reveals that the figurines are a *reflection* on the train window, not something being viewed outside of it. The critique is that the caption fails to mention this crucial distinction. Furthermore, it completely omits any description of the actual scenery visible *through* the glass, which is essential for context. For instance, the caption doesn't describe the dark, blurry landscape or the city lights rushing past outside, which would contrast with the sharp, static reflection of the train's interior. The description of the camera movement is good, but the reveal it leads to is not clearly articulated. A better caption would specify that the figurines are a reflection of the train's interior and would also describe the moving environment visible outside the window, which confirms the setting and enhances the visual narrative of the journey.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an indoor setting, a row of silver, metallic soldier figurines stands at attention, their polished surfaces reflecting bright light. These figurines, wearing helmets and uniforms with chest straps, are actually a reflection on a train window. As the view slowly pulls back, the scene reveals a dark, blurry landscape with city lights rushing past outside, contrasting with the sharp, static reflection of the train's interior. This juxtaposition of the moving environment and the still reflection enhances the visual narrative of the journey.",
