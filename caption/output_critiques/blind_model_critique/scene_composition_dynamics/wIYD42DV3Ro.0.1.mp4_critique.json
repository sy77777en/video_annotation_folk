    "pre_caption": "The video captures a horse racing event from a broadcast POV shot set up for television production. The setting is outdoors at a racetrack, with a large grandstand filled with spectators on one side and a well-maintained grassy area on the other. The time of day is overcast, with diffused daylight illuminating the scene. The racetrack is a dirt path, and the horses, ridden by jockeys in colorful attire, are in motion, kicking up dust as they race. The grandstand is a multi-tiered structure with a distinctive spire, adding architectural interest. In the background, there are additional buildings and tents, suggesting a bustling event atmosphere. Overlay elements include a network logo in the top right corner, indicating the broadcast nature of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A television broadcast-style viewpoint.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a solid overview of the horse racing scene, it misses some key details characteristic of a professional broadcast and could be more precise in its descriptions. The mention of only a network logo as an overlay is an understatement; the video clearly shows a persistent, semi-transparent ticker along the bottom of the screen that displays the race number, the current running order with horse numbers and jockey silks, and the fractional times for the race. The description of the camera work as a \"broadcast POV shot\" is accurate, but it fails to specify that the camera executes a smooth, continuous pan from left to right, keeping the lead group of horses centered in the shot as they navigate the far turn of the track. Furthermore, the description of the \"tents\" on the infield is vague; they are large, white, peak-top marquees arranged in a neat row. The \"additional building\" that comes into view could be more specifically described as a long, two-story structure with a red-tiled roof, which helps to better ground the scene without inferring the building's purpose. Lastly, the phrase \"suggesting a bustling event atmosphere\" is an inference that violates the instruction to avoid subjective interpretation.",
