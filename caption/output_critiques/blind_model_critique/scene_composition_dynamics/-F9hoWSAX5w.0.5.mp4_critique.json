The structure is partially covered in tattered construction wrap and has visible fire escape stairs. The sky is overcast, casting a muted, greenish hue over the scene, suggesting a cloudy day. The building's facade shows signs of wear, with exposed brick and peeling materials. The environment appears still, with no visible movement or activity, emphasizing the building's neglected state.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, even though it is generally accurate in its description of the scene's physical elements.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Accurate Details:** The caption correctly identifies the main subject (a multi-story building with a cylindrical tower), its condition (signs of wear, exposed brick, peeling materials), and specific features (construction wrap, fire escape stairs).\n*   **Environmental Accuracy:** The description of the overcast sky, the resulting muted/greenish light, and the lack of motion are all plausible and well-described visual details.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, drone shot, street-level view). This is a critical piece of information required by the instructions to describe how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation:** Starting the caption with \"The video depicts...\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'... Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The description should begin by describing the scene directly, not by referring to the medium itself.\n*   **Violation:** Using the subjective adjective \"dilapidated.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" While the building shows signs of wear, \"dilapidated\" is an interpretation of its state rather than a neutral observation. The later phrase \"shows signs of wear\" is a much better, more objective description.\n*   **Violation:** Using speculative language like \"suggesting a cloudy day\" and \"The environment appears still.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The caption should state what is visible: \"The sky is overcast\" and \"The environment is still.\"\n*   **Violation:** Explaining the scene's emphasis with \"...emphasizing the building's neglected state.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" This is a direct interpretation of the artistic or emotional effect of the scene, which is explicitly forbidden. The description should focus only on what is visually present.\n\n### Corrected Example:\n\nHere is an example of how the caption could be rewritten to follow all instructions:\n\n\"From a street-level point of view, a multi-story building with a cylindrical corner tower stands in an outdoor urban setting under an overcast sky. The light has a muted, greenish hue. The building's facade has exposed brick and peeling materials, and it is partially covered in tattered construction wrap, with fire escape stairs visible on its side. The scene is still, with no discernible movement or activity.\"",
