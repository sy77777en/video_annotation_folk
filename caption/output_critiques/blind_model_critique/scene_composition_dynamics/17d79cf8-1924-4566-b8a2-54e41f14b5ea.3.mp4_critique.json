    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place outdoors during the day. The setting is a construction site with a focus on bricklaying. The ground is covered with reddish-brown dirt and scattered bricks, some whole and others broken. A person’s hands are visible, interacting with the bricks, indicating active construction work. A round container filled with gray cement is present, suggesting ongoing masonry tasks. In the background, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, with some greenery peeking through, adding a natural element to the scene. The environment is dry, with no visible signs of moisture or weather effects. The overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor and construction activity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates several key instructions, although it follows others correctly.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"first-person POV.\"\n*   **Setting, Environment, and Time:** It clearly states the setting is \"outdoors during the day\" at a \"construction site.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It accurately describes the color and state of the ground (\"reddish-brown dirt and scattered bricks\"), the container (\"round container filled with gray cement\"), and background elements (\"partially constructed brick wall,\" \"greenery\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple and the description is organized logically from the general scene to specific details.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Violation: Avoids Inference and Speculation:**\n    *   The caption states a container is \"suggesting ongoing masonry tasks\" and that hands are \"indicating active construction work.\" These are inferences about the purpose of the objects and actions. The instruction is to describe only what is visible, not what is suggested or indicated.\n    *   **Correction:** Instead of \"suggesting ongoing masonry tasks,\" it should simply state, \"A round container holds gray cement.\" Instead of \"indicating active construction work,\" it should describe the action itself, such as \"A person's hands handle bricks and mortar.\"\n\n*   **Violation: Avoids Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:**\n    *   The final sentence, \"The overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor and construction activity,\" is a direct violation. It interprets the meaning and feeling of the scene rather than describing its visual components. The instruction explicitly states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n\n*   **Violation: Focuses on Setting, Not Interpretation:**\n    *   Phrases like \"with a focus on bricklaying\" and the concluding sentence shift the caption from a neutral description to an interpretation of the scene's subject matter and theme.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the visual elements but fails to adhere to the strict constraints against inference, interpretation, and summarizing the scene's \"sense\" or \"focus.\" The last sentence, in particular, is a significant departure from the required objective and descriptive tone. To be considered \"good\" under the given rules, the caption must be purely descriptive and avoid any language that interprets the meaning or purpose of the scene's contents and actions.",
