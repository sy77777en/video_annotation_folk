    "pre_caption": "An outdoor, animated scene is set by a calm, blue-green body of water. In the background, a large, out-of-focus vessel with a prominent mast is moored under a hazy, light blue sky with soft clouds. The overall visual style is that of a hand-drawn illustration.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but incomplete. It successfully captures the general atmosphere and key visual elements but misses some details required by the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as an outdoor, animated setting by a body of water. The descriptions of the \"blue-green\" water, the \"out-of-focus vessel with a prominent mast,\" and the \"hazy, light blue sky with soft clouds\" are precise and factually correct based on the visual information. The identification of the \"hand-drawn illustration\" style is also an accurate assessment of the visual treatment.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits several key details mandated by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It does not specify the point of view (e.g., eye-level, low-angle shot).\n*   **Time of Day:** While \"light blue sky\" implies daytime, the instruction asks to state the time of day explicitly.\n*   **Motion:** This is the most significant omission. The instructions require a description of motion for videos. The caption describes the water as \"calm\" but does not mention if there are any subtle movements, such as gentle ripples, the swaying of the vessel, or the drifting of clouds, which would be expected in an animated video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Followed:** The caption adheres well to many negative constraints. It is a single paragraph, avoids forbidden terms like \"image,\" uses simple and objective language, and refrains from speculation or emotional adjectives. It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery.\n*   **Not Followed:** The caption fails to adhere to the affirmative instructions to include the point of view, an explicit time of day, and a description of any motion present in the video. These elements are crucial for providing a comprehensive description as outlined in the prompt.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is viewed from an eye-level perspective, set during the daytime by a calm, blue-green body of water. In the background, a large, out-of-focus vessel with a prominent mast is moored under a hazy, light blue sky with soft clouds. The water gently ripples, the vessel subtly sways, and the clouds drift slowly across the sky, all contributing to the serene atmosphere. The overall visual style is that of a hand-drawn illustration.",
