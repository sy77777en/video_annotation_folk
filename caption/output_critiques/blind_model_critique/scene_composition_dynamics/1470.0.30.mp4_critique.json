    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor bathroom setting with a person relaxing in a bathtub filled with white, frothy bubbles. The room features a radiator and a muted color palette, with soft lighting suggesting a calm atmosphere. The person in the tub has a towel wrapped around their head and wears headphones, with cucumber slices placed over their eyes. The scene transitions as the person's expression changes from relaxed to surprised, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor bathroom setting, the presence of a person in a bubble-filled bathtub, and the soft, natural daytime lighting. However, it deviates from the instructions by providing excessive detail about the subject, describing the towel on their head, the headphones, and the cucumber slices over their eyes, which shifts the focus away from the scenery. The use of the word \"relaxing\" introduces a subjective emotional state, and the phrase \"suggesting the daytime\" is a minor inference, both of which are to be avoided in favor of direct, objective descriptions. Furthermore, the caption omits the point of view, which could be a static, eye-level shot. It could also provide more specific details about the environment's materials as instructed, for example, by describing the radiator as a \"white, vertically-ribbed radiator\" or mentioning other plausible elements like \"light grey tiled walls\" or a \"small wooden stool\" next to the tub to better establish the setting. A more compliant description would focus on the room's features first and then place the subject within it with less specific detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor bathroom with a white, vertically-ribbed radiator and light grey tiled walls, creating a muted color palette. Soft, natural lighting fills the room, enhancing the calm atmosphere. A small wooden stool is positioned next to a bathtub filled with white, frothy bubbles.
