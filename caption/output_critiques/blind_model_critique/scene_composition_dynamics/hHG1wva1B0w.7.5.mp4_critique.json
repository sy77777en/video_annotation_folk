    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors in a room resembling a library or study, with dark wood bookshelves filled with books lining the back wall. A large window is on the left, and the floor is tiled in a black and white checkered pattern. In the center of the room, a red, translucent figure sits in a gray chair at a light-colored wooden table. On the table are a stack of books, a small white cup, and several scattered papers. Text overlays are present at the bottom of the screen, with \"June 7th, 1977\" on the left and \"Pitkin County Courthouse, Aspen, Co\" on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the indoor setting and key objects, it misses several crucial visual details that define the scene's character and misrepresents the animation of the overlays. The description fails to specify the point of view, which is a static, eye-level medium shot, creating a formal, observational feel. The \"red, slightly reflective figure\" is too vague; it is a person wearing a glossy, crimson-colored raincoat and hat, obscuring their features. The caption omits the dominant light source: soft, cool daylight filtering through the large window, which casts a distinct shadow of the figure across the light-colored wooden table and checkered floor. Furthermore, the location text, \"Pitkin County Courthouse, Aspen, Colorado,\" does not appear all at once but is typed out with a typewriter sound effect, reinforcing the 1977 date. The persistent \"[2,19]\" overlay is not just text but is enclosed within a semi-transparent, white, rectangular box resembling a case file label. Finally, the caption neglects to mention the view through the window, which shows the out-of-focus green leaves of a large tree, and it misses the aged, slightly dusty texture of the dark wood bookshelves.",
