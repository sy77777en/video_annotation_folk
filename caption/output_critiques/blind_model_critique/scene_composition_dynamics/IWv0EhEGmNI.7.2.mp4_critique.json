    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out onto a dark, foggy street at night. The scene is dimly illuminated by a single, tall streetlamp whose light is diffused by the thick fog. On the left stands a dark, two-story building with an arched doorway that reveals a lit room inside. The view is partially obscured by a dark structure on the right, and as the perspective shifts slightly, a white car and a body on the paved ground become visible further down the street. The scene includes several overlay elements: a compass at the top of the screen, objective text that changes from \"Find Hadir.\" to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir.\", location markers with distance indicators, and dialogue subtitles at the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by establishing the first-person POV and the dark, foggy atmosphere, but it misses key visual details that would be prominent in such a video game scene. A crucial omission is the lack of any mention of the character's hands or a held weapon, which would typically occupy the lower portion of the screen in a first-person perspective and are essential for context. The description of the environment could be more specific; \"dark structure on the right\" is vague and could be improved by identifying it as a \"weathered brick wall\" or a \"rusted shipping container.\" Likewise, \"paved ground\" could be enhanced to \"wet asphalt,\" which would realistically reflect the single streetlamp's \"hazy, yellow light.\" The motion is described as a \"slight shift,\" but a more active description like a \"slow, cautious walk forward\" would better capture the movement. Furthermore, while the overlay elements are correctly identified, their visual characteristics are missing; specifying that the HUD elements, such as the compass and objective text, are rendered in a \"cool blue and white digital font\" would provide a more complete picture. Finally, the description of the objective text \"changing\" is a bit awkward; it would be clearer to state that the objective \"updates from 'Find Hadir.' to 'Search the clocktower for Hadir.'\" during the scene.",
