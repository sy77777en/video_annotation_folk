    "pre_caption": "The video shows a recording of a computer screen with visible UI elements, likely from video editing software. The interface includes various controls and color grading tools, such as color wheels and scopes, displayed prominently at the bottom. The main section features a video clip with a green tint, possibly night vision, showing a person holding a camera. The environment is indoors, with the software interface providing a structured and technical setting. The overall color scheme is dark, with the green-tinted video clip contrasting against the darker interface. The time of day is not specified, but the screen's brightness and the software's dark theme suggest a focus on clarity and detail.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**This is a recording of a computer screen with visible UI elements.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but has several significant flaws when measured against the detailed instructions. It correctly identifies the general content but fails on key requirements regarding speculation, motion, point of view, and inference.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Good:** The caption accurately identifies the main subject as a \"recording of a computer screen\" showing \"video editing software\" with \"color wheels and scopes.\"\n*   **Good:** It correctly describes the content of the video clip: a \"green tint,\" a \"person holding a camera,\" and a \"dark\" color scheme.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The statement \"The environment is indoors\" is ambiguous. It fails to distinguish between the setting of the video clip (indoors) and the primary setting of the overall scene (a digital software interface). The instruction asks for a clear description of the setting.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Missing - Point of View:** The caption fails to explicitly state the point of view, which is a **screen recording**. This is a specific requirement of the instructions.\n*   **Missing - Motion:** This is a major omission. The caption describes a static scene, but the video contains significant motion. It fails to mention that the video clip is playing, the person in the clip is moving, the scopes are actively changing in real-time, and a mouse cursor moves across the screen to interact with the software.\n*   **Missing - Overlays:** While it mentions \"UI elements,\" it doesn't explicitly identify them as overlays as instructed. The entire software interface and the mouse cursor are overlay elements that should be described as such.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation - Avoid Speculation:** The caption uses the words \"**likely** from video editing software\" and \"**possibly** night vision.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements (\"'there might be,' 'it appears'\"). The presence of color wheels and scopes makes it definitively color grading/editing software, and the visual style is clearly meant to be night vision. These should be stated factually.\n*   **Violation - Do Not Infer or Explain Emphasis:** The last sentence, \"...the software's dark theme **suggest a focus on clarity and detail**,\" is a direct violation of the rule \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" It infers the *purpose* of the design choice, which is forbidden.\n*   **Violation - Do Not Infer the Role of the Scene Setting:** The phrase \"...with the software interface **providing a structured and technical setting**\" is an interpretation of the setting's role, which the instructions prohibit.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates several core instructions. It uses speculative language, infers purpose and emphasis, and omits crucial details like motion and a clear point of view. A better caption would state the facts of the scene directly and without interpretation, clearly distinguishing between the software interface and the video clip it contains, and describing the dynamic elements.\n\nHere is an example of a caption that would better follow the instructions:\n\n**A screen recording shows a dark-themed video color grading software interface. In the main preview window, a green-tinted, night-vision-style video clip plays, showing a person in a dark indoor setting holding a camera. Below the preview are three prominent color wheels labeled \"Lift,\" \"Gamma,\" and \"Gain.\" To the right, animated scopes, including a waveform and vectorscope, react in real-time to the video content. A white arrow-shaped mouse cursor moves across the screen, interacting with the user interface.**",
