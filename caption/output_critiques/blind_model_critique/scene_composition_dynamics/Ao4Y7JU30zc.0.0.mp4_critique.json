    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good but has a few areas where it deviates from the specific instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key visual elements: the dim, hazy lighting, the silhouetted figure, the bench, the backlight, the empty hangers, and the precise text on the sign. The description of the floor and walls is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is mostly complete, covering the environment, setting, and notable visual elements.\n*   **Omission:** The caption fails to mention the **point of view** (e.g., static, eye-level shot), which is a specific requirement in the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It successfully combines details into a single, coherent paragraph without referring to specific frames.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or speculative language like \"it appears.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the sign as a physical object in the scene rather than an overlay.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery, keeping the description of the subject minimal as requested.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective Language:** The phrase \"utilitarian feel\" is subjective and interpretative. The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" A more objective description would focus solely on the physical attributes, such as \"The room is furnished simply with a bench and has a plain concrete floor.\" The word \"stark\" is also borderline subjective.\n    *   **Inference:** Identifying the location as a \"locker room\" is an inference based on the visual cues (bench, hangers, sports sign). While it is a logical and likely correct conclusion, the instruction \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" suggests it would be more compliant to describe the components without naming the room type (e.g., \"In a dimly lit room...\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written and captures the scene effectively. However, to be in perfect alignment with the instructions, it should **add the point of view** and **remove subjective language** like \"utilitarian feel\" and \"stark.\"",
