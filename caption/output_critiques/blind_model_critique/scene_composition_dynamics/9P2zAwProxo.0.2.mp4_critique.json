    "pre_caption": "A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures them moving down a wide, snow-covered ski slope during the day. The slope is bordered by a forest of bare, leafless trees under an overcast sky. The person is dressed in winter gear, including a black helmet, blue-tinted goggles, a black vest over a light-colored jacket, and red gloves, while holding ski poles. The packed snow shows tracks, and more trees are visible in the background on the rolling terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed (e.g., by hand, selfie stick, or invisible selfie rod) and is facing them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the selfie point of view and the general setting of a ski slope. However, the description of the person's attire, including details like 'white buttons and white sleeves,' is excessively detailed and shifts focus away from the scenery, contrary to the instruction to avoid detailed subject descriptions. The description of motion is generic; it could be improved by specifying the activity (skiing or snowboarding) and describing the dynamic action, such as carving turns and kicking up plumes of snow. The caption misses key atmospheric details, such as the flat, grey light typical of an overcast day or the reflection of the surrounding forest visible in the person's blue-tinted goggles. Additionally, it omits plausible background elements like other distant skiers on the rolling terrain and potential overlays, such as a camera brand watermark in a corner of the view. Refining the description to include these dynamic and environmental details while simplifying the subject's description would create a more vivid and compliant caption.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A selfie POV shot captures a skier gracefully carving turns down a wide, snow-covered slope, kicking up plumes of snow under an overcast sky. The flat, grey light of the day enhances the serene atmosphere, with the surrounding forest of bare trees reflecting in the skier's blue-tinted goggles. The skier, dressed in winter gear with a black helmet and red gloves, is seen holding ski poles. Tracks crisscross the packed snow, and distant skiers dot the rolling terrain. A subtle camera brand watermark appears in the corner, adding an authentic touch to the scene.",
