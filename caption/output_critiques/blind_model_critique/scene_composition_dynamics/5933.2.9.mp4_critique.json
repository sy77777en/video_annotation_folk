    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a field of tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through a partly cloudy sky, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the background, leafless trees form a dark silhouette against the sky, suggesting a season of late autumn or early winter. The grasses are slender and topped with feathery plumes, adding texture to the landscape. A person with a backpack is present, moving through the field, their back to the viewer, which adds a sense of scale and direction to the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with a focus on the interaction between the person and the expansive, serene environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the core elements of the scene, such as the golden field and the time of day. However, it misses several key details and violates some instructions. The point of view is not specified; the video is filmed from a steady, eye-level third-person perspective that tracks the person from behind. The description of the background is vague; the leafless trees form a distinct, dark treeline against a pale blue sky streaked with wispy white clouds, not just a silhouette. A crucial detail is omitted: the person is not just moving through the field but is following a narrow, trodden dirt path that winds through the tall grass. The caption also includes speculative phrasing (\"appears to be,\" \"suggesting a season\") and subjective interpretations (\"calm and natural,\" \"serene environment,\" \"adds a sense of scale\"), which should be replaced with purely descriptive language. For instance, instead of \"suggesting a season,\" it could state the trees are bare. Finally, the description fails to mention a small, semi-transparent watermark with a logo in the bottom-right corner of the screen.",
