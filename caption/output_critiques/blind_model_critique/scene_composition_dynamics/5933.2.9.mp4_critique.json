    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a field of tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through a partly cloudy sky, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the background, leafless trees form a dark silhouette against the sky, suggesting a season of late autumn or early winter. The grasses are slender and topped with feathery plumes, adding texture to the landscape. A person with a backpack is present, moving through the field, their back to the viewer, which adds a sense of scale and direction to the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with a focus on the interaction between the person and the expansive, serene environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it accurately describes the visual content, it violates several key negative constraints outlined in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the rules:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual scene it portrays (a person in a field of grass). It correctly identifies the setting, time of day, natural elements, and the subject's presence.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete, covering the environment, time of day, notable visual elements (grasses, trees), and the subject. However, it is missing one required element:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions state to indicate the POV if relevant. The description implies a third-person shot, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It breaks several explicit rules:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   The caption uses: `\"...appears to be late afternoon...\"`\n    *   The caption uses: `\"...suggesting a season of late autumn or early winter.\"`\n\n*   **Violation 2: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses: `\"...casting a warm glow...\"`\n    *   The caption uses: `\"The overall atmosphere is calm and natural...\"`\n    *   The caption uses: `\"...expansive, serene environment.\"`\n\n*   **Violation 3: Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption does this twice.\n    *   It interprets the subject's role: `\"...which adds a sense of scale and direction to the scene.\"`\n    *   It explains the focus of the video: `\"...with a focus on the interaction between the person and the expansive, serene environment.\"`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe caption is poorly written because it prioritizes creating a mood over adhering to the strict, objective requirements of the instructions. It includes speculation, subjective descriptions, and interpretive analysis, all of which were explicitly forbidden.\n\nA good caption, following all the instructions, would look like this:\n\nFrom a third-person perspective, the video shows an outdoor field of tall, golden grasses under a partly cloudy sky during the late afternoon. The slender grasses have feathery plumes and sway in the breeze. In the background are the dark silhouettes of leafless trees. A person wearing a backpack moves through the field with their back toward the camera.",
