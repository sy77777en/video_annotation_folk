    "pre_caption": "In a third-person 3D game video, the scene is set at a vibrant, outdoor street festival during the daytime. The central focus is a large, white, rectangular conveyor belt platform surrounded by wooden cooking stations equipped with stoves, sinks, and ingredient dispensers. The paved ground is scattered with confetti, and the area is decorated with blue and yellow balloons, festive banners, and palm trees, creating a tropical ambiance. Small, cartoonish chef characters move around the kitchen area, while other characters wait behind a counter at the top of the scene. A heads-up display is visible as an overlay. Across the top, several panels depict food orders with their required ingredients. The bottom-left corner shows a gold coin icon with a score of 532 and a tip multiplier, while the bottom-right corner features a timer counting down.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is good but could be more specific about the point of view and the dynamic nature of the scene. The term \"third-person 3D game video\" is a genre, not a camera perspective; specifying a \"fixed, high-angle view\" would more accurately describe how the player sees the entire kitchen layout at once. The description of the characters is somewhat static; the video likely shows them in frantic motion, so mentioning specific actions like chopping ingredients on wooden boards, carrying finished plates, and washing dishes would better capture the gameplay. The concept of a \"kitchen float\" implies movement, which isn't described; the caption could be improved by noting if the float is slowly moving forward along a street, with crowds of spectators or other parade elements visible in the background. Additionally, while the HUD is well-described, the caption could mention dynamic visual cues, such as the timer turning red as it nears zero or completed food orders being checked off with a green tick, which are common and important visual indicators in this type of game. Finally, the \"tropical ambiance\" could be reinforced by describing details on the float itself, such as bamboo trim or tiki-style carvings on the cooking stations, which would likely be present to support the theme.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a vibrant, outdoor street festival scene during the daytime, the video showcases a fixed, high-angle view of a bustling kitchen float in a third-person 3D game.

Confetti is scattered on the paved ground, and the area is festively decorated with blue and yellow balloons, banners, and palm trees. Small, cartoonish chef characters are in frantic motion, chopping ingredients on wooden boards, carrying finished plates, and washing dishes. The float slowly moves forward along the street, with crowds of spectators and other parade elements visible in the background. A heads-up display overlays the scene, with panels at the top showing food orders and their required ingredients. As the timer in the bottom-right corner counts down, it turns red when nearing zero, while completed orders are checked off with a green tick.
