In the middle distance, two figures ride camels, moving across the expansive terrain. The background is dominated by a range of dark, rocky mountains, one of which has a distinct pyramid-like shape. A rocky, dark brown slope occupies the left foreground, while a small, green bush sits on the right. In the far distance, the landscape flattens into a plain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good, but it has one notable omission.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies and describes all the key elements of the scene: the desert landscape, rolling orange dunes, pale blue sky, the two figures on camels, the dark rocky mountains with a pyramid-like peak, the foreground slope, and the small green bush. The description of colors, shapes, and placement of these elements is precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete according to the instructions. It successfully includes:\n*   **Environment and Setting:** A vast outdoor desert landscape.\n*   **Time of Day:** Implied as daytime with the \"pale blue sky.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It provides excellent detail on the dunes, mountains, slope, and bush, including their color and shape.\n*   **Subjects:** The figures on camels are included with appropriate context and placement (\"middle distance\") without excessive detail.\n*   **Motion:** It correctly notes that the figures are \"moving across the expansive terrain.\"\n\nHowever, it is missing one key piece of information required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., a wide shot, a static shot, a panning shot from a ground-level perspective). This is a required element that influences how the viewer perceives the scene's scale and composition.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres well to the stylistic and formatting rules:\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"lonely\").\n*   It avoids speculation (\"appears to be,\" \"might be\").\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than the subjects.\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It does not infer the purpose of the scene or what it emphasizes.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, descriptive detail, and adherence to most of the stylistic constraints. Its only significant flaw is the failure to describe the **point of view**, which was explicitly requested in the instructions. Adding a phrase like \"A wide, static shot reveals...\" at the beginning would make it fully compliant.",
