    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with a dimly lit, narrow room featuring textured, dark walls. The environment is stark and minimalistic, with a focus on the central figure positioned in the middle of the scene. The walls have a rough, uneven surface, adding to the austere atmosphere. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows and highlighting the contours of the figure's back. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by earthy tones. Overlay elements include a small icon in the bottom left corner, which is not part of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas where it fails to adhere to the specific negative constraints and requirements of the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the scene as an \"indoor setting with a dimly lit, narrow room featuring textured, dark walls\" is correct. The characterization of the environment as \"stark and minimalistic\" and the walls having a \"rough, uneven surface\" is also accurate. The description of the lighting as \"subdued\" and the color palette as \"muted\" fits the visual information.\n*   **Slightly Inaccurate:** The shadows are quite strong and create high contrast rather than being uniformly \"soft.\" The term \"earthy tones\" is a reasonable interpretation, but the scene is closer to a desaturated or monochromatic palette dominated by grays, blacks, and skin tones.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Missing - Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view, which is a specific requirement. It should have stated that the video is from a **static, eye-level point of view** positioned behind the subject.\n*   **Missing - Motion:** The instructions require a description of motion or changes. A key feature of this video is its complete lack of motion; it is a static shot. This should have been mentioned.\n*   **Incomplete - Overlay Description:** While the caption correctly identifies the overlay icon, it could be more descriptive by mentioning its color (white).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction:**\n\n*   **Violation - Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption violates this rule twice:\n    *   \"...with a **focus on** the central figure...\"\n    *   \"...**highlighting** the contours of the figure's back.\"\n    These phrases interpret the compositional and lighting choices rather than just describing them objectively.\n\n*   **Violation - Subjective/Inferential Language:** The instruction says to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and not to infer the role of the setting. The phrase:\n    *   \"...adding to the **austere atmosphere**.\"\n    This is an interpretation of the mood and the *effect* of the visual elements, which is discouraged.\n\n*   **Violation - Introductory Text:** The instruction states, \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption begins with:\n    *   \"The video presents...\"\n    This is unnecessary introductory phrasing. The description should begin directly.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more closely follows all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the scene is set indoors within a dimly lit, narrow room with dark, textured walls. The walls have a rough, uneven surface. A single figure is positioned in the center, seen from behind. The lighting is high-contrast, creating bright areas on the figure's back and casting deep shadows. The overall color palette is muted and desaturated. The scene is motionless. A small, white overlay icon is present in the bottom left corner.",
