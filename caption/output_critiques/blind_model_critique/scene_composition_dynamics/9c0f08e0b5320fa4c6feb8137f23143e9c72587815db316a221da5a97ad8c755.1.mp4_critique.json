    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully captures the main essence of the scene but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and misses a few required details.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate. It provides a clear and correct description of the setting (indoors, textured wall), the subject and their action (a young man playing a keyboard), the key props (stool, keyboard), and the camera motion (slowly pulling back). The descriptions of color, texture, and material are specific and plausible.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing two specific elements requested in the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions explicitly ask to indicate the point of view (e.g., eye-level, straight-on shot). While the caption describes the camera *movement* (pulling back), it doesn't state the initial POV.\n*   **Time of Day:** The instructions require mentioning the time of day. Even in an artificially lit indoor scene where the time is indeterminate, this aspect is unaddressed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n*   It correctly identifies the setting as \"indoors.\"\n*   It describes the color, material, and texture of visual elements (wall, stool, keyboard).\n*   It keeps the subject description minimal and contextual.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It correctly describes the camera motion (\"slowly pulls back\").\n*   It avoids mentioning anything not visible.\n\n**Where it violates the instructions:**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives and Interpretation:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The phrase \"**creating a neutral and minimalist setting**\" directly violates this. \"Neutral\" and \"minimalist\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's style and mood. The caption should describe the elements that lead to this feeling (e.g., \"The scene contains only a stool, a keyboard, and a person against a plain wall\") rather than labeling the setting itself.\n*   **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction says to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'.\" The phrase \"**resembles concrete or plaster**\" is a soft form of speculation. While it's a useful comparison, a stricter adherence would describe only the visible texture and finish without comparing it to something it might be. A better phrasing would be, \"a large wall with a textured, mottled, light-grey and beige finish.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong attempt that is accurate and descriptive. However, its use of subjective, interpretive language (\"neutral and minimalist\") is a clear violation of the instructions. To be fully compliant, it would need to remove those subjective terms and add the missing details about the point of view and time of day.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is set indoors against a large wall with a textured, mottled, light-grey and beige finish. In the foreground, a young man is seated on a simple wooden stool, playing a black electronic keyboard. The environment is evenly lit, and the camera is positioned at eye-level, capturing a straight-on shot. As the camera slowly pulls back, it gradually widens the view to include more of the keyboard and the simple surroundings. The time of day is not specified, but the lighting suggests an artificially lit setting.",
