    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with dim lighting, creating a shadowy and mysterious atmosphere. The environment appears to be a workshop or mechanical space, characterized by industrial elements. A beam of light cuts through the darkness, highlighting dust particles in the air. The walls are obscured, but a yellow garment hangs in the background, adding a splash of color. The scene includes machinery with visible wires and metal components, suggesting a focus on technical or mechanical work. The overall color palette is dark, with muted tones and subtle contrasts between light and shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the dim, industrial feel of the scene, but it misses several key details and violates some core instructions. It fails to specify the point of view, which is a slow, steady pan from left to right at eye-level, creating a sense of deliberate observation. The description of \"machinery\" is too general; the video clearly shows a partially disassembled motorcycle engine on a workbench, with greasy metal parts, exposed copper wiring, and a soldering iron from which a faint wisp of smoke rises, adding subtle motion that the caption omits. The \"yellow garment\" is identifiable as a high-visibility safety vest hanging from a hook on a pegboard wall, a detail that would add more specific context to the workshop setting. The caption also neglects to mention a small, semi-transparent watermark for \"MechWorks\" in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Furthermore, it uses the speculative phrase \"appears to be,\" the subjective adjective \"mysterious,\" and the inferential clause \"suggesting a focus on technical or mechanical work,\" all of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions.",
