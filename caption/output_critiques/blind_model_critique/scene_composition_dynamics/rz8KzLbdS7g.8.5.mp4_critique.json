    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, capturing a serene residential neighborhood on a sunny day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a quiet street lined with well-maintained houses. The houses are primarily two-story structures with light-colored facades, surrounded by lush greenery and neatly trimmed hedges. A silver van is parked on the left side of the street, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sky is partly cloudy, allowing sunlight to cast soft shadows on the ground. The street is paved, with a mix of concrete and cobblestone paths leading to the house entrances. Vibrant green plants and blooming flowers, including hydrangeas, enhance the tranquil atmosphere. The overall environment is peaceful, with a sense of suburban calmness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person point of view and the general suburban setting, it misses key dynamic elements and includes subjective language forbidden by the instructions. The video likely involves motion, such as a slow walk forward, causing the perspective to shift and revealing more of the street, but the caption describes a static scene. It also uses prohibited emotional and inferential phrases like \"serene,\" \"well-maintained,\" \"tranquil atmosphere,\" and \"adding a touch of everyday life.\" The description of the houses as having \"light-colored facades\" is too general; in the video, they are clearly white vinyl siding with black shutters. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention that the character's hands, holding a smartphone as if recording, are visible at the bottom of the view. It also omits a crucial overlay: a small, semi-transparent watermark with the text \"Oakwood Living\" in the bottom-right corner. A more accurate description would incorporate the forward walking motion, replace subjective terms with objective details like \"a street with no visible pedestrian or vehicle traffic,\" specify the house materials, and include the visible hands and the text overlay.",
