    "pre_caption": "A third-person 3D game video shows a scene inside a vast, dark warehouse-like structure. The environment is rendered in a monochromatic style, with high ceilings, exposed beams, and large, high-up windows. A single spotlight hangs from the ceiling, casting a bright, circular beam onto the dark floor, which is marked with yellow lines. In the background, a large open doorway reveals a foggy exterior with a bare tree and the silhouette of a bus. Numerous stylized, faceless figures in dark clothing are scattered throughout the space, some standing in a group while others are positioned individually. A single figure wearing a red shirt stands directly within the spotlight's beam.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the scene as \"monochromatic\" when it clearly features selective color with the yellow floor lines and the prominent red shirt; a more accurate description would be a desaturated or grayscale environment with specific color highlights. It also completely omits any sense of motion, which was central to the video. The camera wasn't static but performed a slow, deliberate dolly zoom, moving from a wide shot of the entire warehouse to a medium shot focused on the figure in the red shirt, creating a sense of growing importance. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the subtle environmental movements, such as dust motes swirling in the spotlight's beam and the thick fog billowing slowly past the open doorway. For a \"3D game video,\" a critical missing detail is the minimalist heads-up display (HUD) in the bottom-left corner, which showed a simple, white health bar and an objective marker. The description of the \"faceless figures\" is also too general; in the video, they were not just stylized but appeared to be made of a glossy, black obsidian-like material that faintly reflected the single light source, and they were not entirely still but engaged in a subtle, synchronized swaying motion.",
