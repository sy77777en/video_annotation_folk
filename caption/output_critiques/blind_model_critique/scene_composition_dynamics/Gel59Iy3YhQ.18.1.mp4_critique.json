    "pre_caption": "A third-person 3D game video shows a scene inside a vast, dark warehouse-like structure. The environment is rendered in a monochromatic style, with high ceilings, exposed beams, and large, high-up windows. A single spotlight hangs from the ceiling, casting a bright, circular beam onto the dark floor, which is marked with yellow lines. In the background, a large open doorway reveals a foggy exterior with a bare tree and the silhouette of a bus. Numerous stylized, faceless figures in dark clothing are scattered throughout the space, some standing in a group while others are positioned individually. A single figure wearing a red shirt stands directly within the spotlight's beam.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video game scene. It identifies specific, verifiable details like the warehouse-like structure, the monochromatic style, the single spotlight, the yellow floor lines, the foggy exterior with a tree and bus, and the distinct figures, including the one in the red shirt. Every element mentioned is a concrete visual detail.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete and addresses all the required components from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as a \"third-person 3D game video,\" which is a specific and appropriate POV for this type of media.\n*   **Setting:** Clearly states it is \"inside a vast, dark warehouse-like structure\" and describes the exterior view through the doorway.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It details the \"high ceilings, exposed beams,\" the \"single spotlight,\" the \"dark floor... marked with yellow lines,\" and the \"stylized, faceless figures.\"\n*   **Color and Style:** It specifies the \"monochromatic style\" and the contrasting \"red shirt\" and \"yellow lines.\"\n*   **Subjects:** The figures are described in terms of their placement (\"scattered,\" \"in a group,\" \"individually\") and appearance (\"stylized, faceless,\" \"dark clothing\") without excessive detail, perfectly complementing the scene as instructed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the rules meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that flows logically from the general environment to specific details.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words (e.g., \"eerie,\" \"dramatic\"). Words like \"vast\" and \"dark\" are used as objective descriptors of size and light level.\n*   **No Speculation:** It avoids phrases like \"it seems\" or \"it might be.\" It states what is present.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The primary focus is on the environment, with the subjects described only in relation to their place within it.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It does not use \"image,\" \"frame,\" or other prohibited words.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n*   **No Inference:** The caption describes *what* is in the scene but does not infer *why* (e.g., it doesn't call it a \"standoff\" or a \"meeting\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and comprehensive without being speculative or overly detailed.",
