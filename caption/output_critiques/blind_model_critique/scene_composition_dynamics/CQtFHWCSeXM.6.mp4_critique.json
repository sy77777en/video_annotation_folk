    "pre_caption": "The video shows the exterior of a large, two-story red brick house with white-framed windows and a dark shingled roof, set behind a black wrought iron fence with spear-point finials. An arched wooden front door is a central feature of the house. In the foreground, a well-maintained green lawn and various bushes, including one with red flowers near the entrance, are visible behind the fence. To the right, a white stucco pillar with a modern black light fixture forms part of the property's boundary, alongside a black wrought iron gate that opens onto a paved area. The scene, captured during the daytime under an overcast sky, also reveals a neighboring house with a light-colored stucco exterior and a red tile roof to the right as the view widens slightly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main features of the house and its immediate surroundings, but it lacks specificity and omits key dynamic and textural details present in the video. The description of the camera movement as \"the view widens slightly\" is an understatement; the video actually begins with a close-up on the modern black light fixture on the white stucco pillar, then executes a slow, smooth pan from left to right, revealing the gate and then the full expanse of the house and a portion of the neighboring property. The caption fails to mention the visible texture of the dark grey asphalt shingles on the roof or the matching red brick chimney on the left side. Furthermore, the \"paved area\" is specifically a driveway made of interlocking grey stone pavers, and the arched wooden front door features a small, rectangular glass pane in its upper section. The scene is not entirely static, as the leaves on the bushes near the entrance can be seen rustling gently in a breeze, an element that adds life to the shot. Finally, the caption completely misses the semi-transparent real estate agency watermark located in the bottom-right corner of the screen.",
