    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place high in the sky within a Minecraft world. The scene is set during the daytime, with a clear blue sky and blocky white clouds. The viewpoint is focused on a large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks, which has a layered, curved design. In the distance below, a green landscape is visible. During the clip, a white block is placed onto the structure and then immediately mined, causing it to shatter into small particles. A small character model stands on a floating platform in the upper left corner. The scene includes several overlay elements: in the bottom left, an inventory hotbar displays various blocks, with the white block selected. In the bottom right, controller prompts for \"Place,\" \"Mine,\" \"Drop,\" and \"Emote\" are visible. A small white crosshair is centered on the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the first-person perspective and the general Minecraft environment, but it lacks specificity regarding key visual details and motion. The description of \"smooth, white blocks\" is too general; in the video, the blocks are clearly white quartz, distinguished by their faint linear texture and chiseled edges, which gives the structure a more refined appearance than simple smooth blocks would. The caption also misses the player's own movement; the viewpoint is not static but involves slow, deliberate flight, with the character drifting sideways and panning to get a better angle for placing blocks on the expansive, multi-tiered platform. Furthermore, while the overlays are mentioned, the description is incomplete, as it omits the prominent health, hunger, and experience bars situated directly above the central hotbar. Finally, the \"large, complex structure\" could be described with more geometric detail, such as noting its sharp, angular design and the presence of light-blue stained glass panes integrated into the white quartz flooring, which are significant visual elements of the build.",
