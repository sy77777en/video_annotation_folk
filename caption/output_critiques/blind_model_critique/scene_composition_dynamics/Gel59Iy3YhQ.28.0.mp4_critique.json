    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place high in the sky within a Minecraft world. The scene is set during the daytime, with a clear blue sky and blocky white clouds. The viewpoint is focused on a large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks, which has a layered, curved design. In the distance below, a green landscape is visible. During the clip, a white block is placed onto the structure and then immediately mined, causing it to shatter into small particles. A small character model stands on a floating platform in the upper left corner. The scene includes several overlay elements: in the bottom left, an inventory hotbar displays various blocks, with the white block selected. In the bottom right, controller prompts for \"Place,\" \"Mine,\" \"Drop,\" and \"Emote\" are visible. A small white crosshair is centered on the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good and follows the instructions closely. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured. However, there are a few minor points for improvement regarding classification and conciseness.\n\n#### Accuracy:\n*   **Highly Accurate:** The caption accurately describes a typical scene from the game *Minecraft*, specifically from a first-person perspective in creative or building mode.\n*   **Details:** The descriptions of the blocky clouds, the action of placing and mining a block (including the shattering particle effect), and the specific UI elements (hotbar, controller prompts, crosshair) are all correct for the game.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The description of \"A small character model stands on a floating platform in the upper left corner\" is likely a misinterpretation. In a first-person view in *Minecraft*, this element is typically a UI overlay (the \"paper doll\") showing the player's skin and armor. It is not a physical character standing in the game world. It should be classified as an overlay element along with the hotbar and prompts.\n\n#### Completeness:\n*   **Very Complete:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n    *   **Environment/Setting:** \"high in the sky within a Minecraft world,\" \"daytime,\" \"clear blue sky,\" \"green landscape.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** The \"large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks\" is well-described.\n    *   **Motion:** The action of placing and mining the block is included.\n    *   **Overlays:** The hotbar, controller prompts, and crosshair are all identified and described.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption adheres to the vast majority of the rules exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly identifies the **point of view** and the **setting** (*Minecraft* world).\n    *   It uses simple, objective language (\"blocky,\" \"smooth,\" \"layered,\" \"shatter\") and avoids emotional or speculative words.\n    *   It correctly identifies most UI elements as **overlays** and describes their content and placement.\n    *   It describes **motion** within the scene (placing and mining the block).\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    1.  **Classification of Elements:** As mentioned in the accuracy section, the \"small character model\" should be described as an overlay, not an object within the scene. Similarly, while the crosshair is described, it isn't explicitly grouped with the other \"overlay elements.\" For perfect adherence, all UI components should be described together as overlays.\n    2.  **Conciseness:** The phrase \"as if through the character’s eyes\" is redundant, as \"first-person POV\" already conveys this meaning. Removing it would make the opening slightly more concise.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback to better align with the instructions:\n\nA first-person POV shot takes place high in the sky within a Minecraft world during the daytime, under a clear blue sky with blocky white clouds. The viewpoint is focused on a large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks with a layered, curved design, while a green landscape is visible in the distance below. During the clip, a white block is placed onto the structure and then immediately mined, causing it to shatter into small particles. The scene includes several overlay elements: a small character model on a platform in the upper left corner, an inventory hotbar in the bottom left, controller prompts in the bottom right, and a small white crosshair centered on the screen.",
