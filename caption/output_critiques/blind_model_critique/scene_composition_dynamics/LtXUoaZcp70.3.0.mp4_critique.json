    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good but has one specific flaw that violates the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the black background, the large circular table with a granular surface, and the six humanoid figures. The description of the figures as glowing blue, constructed from a lattice of particles, having a porous/digital texture, and wearing military-style uniforms is precise and true to the visual information. The description of the camera motion—starting on one figure and pulling back and up to reveal the group—is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully incorporates all the required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** It describes the camera movement (\"gradually pulls back and upwards\") which defines the changing point of view for the viewer.\n*   **Setting:** It establishes the setting as an abstract space (\"Against a stark black background\") with a key prop (\"a large, circular table\").\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It provides excellent detail on the color, material, and texture of the figures (\"glowing blue,\" \"dense lattice of tiny particles,\" \"porous, digital texture\") and the table (\"dark, granular surface\").\n*   **Subjects:** It includes the subjects (\"six humanoid figures\") and their context (\"seated around the table,\" \"wearing military-style uniforms,\" \"static poses\") without excessive detail.\n*   **Motion:** It clearly describes the primary motion in the scene, which is the camera movement.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to almost all of the negative and positive constraints in the instructions, with one notable exception.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It does not infer the purpose of the scene (e.g., calling it a \"war room\").\n*   It avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives.\n*   It combines details from the entire video into a single, flowing description.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n*   The caption violates the rule: **\"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"**\n    *   The phrase \"**appears to be** constructed\" is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. A more direct and compliant phrasing would be: \"Each figure is rendered in a uniform, glowing blue and **is constructed** from a dense lattice of tiny particles...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, detail, and structure. It successfully follows the vast majority of the complex instructions. However, its use of the speculative phrase \"appears to be\" is a direct violation of a key negative constraint. By correcting this single phrase, the caption would be a perfect execution of the instructions.",
