    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes holding a dark gray firearm, shows an outdoor, urban setting during the daytime. The view encompasses light-colored concrete or stucco buildings, one of which has an external black metal staircase that a figure briefly ascends. A dark green armored vehicle is visible in the distance, positioned near stacked wooden crates on the dusty ground. The perspective then moves forward, entering a more enclosed area characterized by wooden scaffolding or debris, with light filtering through gaps in the structure. A heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a mini-map with icons and text in the bottom left, ammunition and status bars in the bottom right, and objective markers in the upper central area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and provides a high-quality description that aligns almost perfectly with the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the **first-person POV**, the presence of a **dark gray firearm**, the **outdoor urban setting**, and the **daytime** lighting.\n*   The descriptions of the environment, including **light-colored buildings**, a **black metal staircase** with a figure on it, a distant **dark green armored vehicle**, and **stacked wooden crates**, are all precise and match the visual content.\n*   The description of the motion—moving forward into an area with **wooden scaffolding or debris**—is also correct.\n*   The description of the **heads-up display (HUD)** as an overlay is accurate, and the placement of its elements (mini-map, ammo count, objective markers) is correctly identified.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete, covering nearly all the essential elements requested.\n*   It successfully includes the point of view, setting, time of day, notable objects, motion, and overlay elements.\n*   The description of the HUD is thorough, detailing its main components and their locations on the screen.\n*   The only minor omission is the small, white crosshair in the center of the screen, which is a persistent part of the HUD. However, its absence does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the description.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption demonstrates an outstanding adherence to the specific rules provided in the instructions.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Tone and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"intense,\" \"chaotic\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Focus:** It focuses on the setting and scenery, mentioning the figure only briefly to provide context for the action, which aligns with the instruction to not give excessive detail on subjects.\n*   **Clarity:** It clearly distinguishes between scene elements and overlays by stating, \"A heads-up display is overlaid on the view.\"\n*   **Motion:** It effectively describes the continuous forward motion and the resulting change in the immediate environment.\n*   **Inference:** It does not infer the role of the setting (e.g., calling it a \"battlefield\" or \"warzone\") or explain what the scene emphasizes, sticking strictly to visual facts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a model caption that successfully follows all constraints and requirements. It is accurate, comprehensive, and written in the precise, objective style requested.",
