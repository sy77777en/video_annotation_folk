    "pre_caption": "A monitor is set within a weathered, greenish-gray industrial frame in a dark environment. The screen displays a corrupted video feed characterized by horizontal scan lines and digital glitches. The feed flickers between two scenes: one is a depiction of an underwater facility labeled \"PATHOS-II,\" situated at a depth between 90 and 4000 meters, with a small map of the Atlantic Ocean visible in the corner. The other scene is a heavily distorted corporate photograph of a team, captioned \"DEVELOPING THE FUTURE AS A TEAM!\" with a \"WAU\" logo in the upper left.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes the physical monitor, its frame, the corrupted nature of the video feed (glitches, scan lines), and the specific content of the two alternating scenes. The details, such as the \"PATHOS-II\" label, the depth gauge, the \"WAU\" logo, and the corporate slogan, are all correctly identified and placed.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the overall setting (\"dark environment\"), the primary object (the monitor and its \"weathered, greenish-gray industrial frame\"), the motion (\"flickers between two scenes\"), and the notable visual elements within the feed, including colors (\"murky teal tones\"), light sources (\"red and white\"), and visual effects (\"pixelated,\" \"distorted\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both informative and easy to read.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. Terms like \"weathered,\" \"corrupted,\" and \"distorted\" are used as objective descriptors of the visual state.\n    *   **Focus on Setting:** It correctly prioritizes the description of the monitor and the scenes it displays over any subjects, mentioning the \"team\" only in the context of a distorted photograph.\n    *   **Handling Transitions:** The use of \"flickers between two scenes\" is an effective and concise way to describe the video's primary motion and scene change, followed by a clear description of each scene.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** The caption correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not infer the purpose or meaning of the scene.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is factual, detailed, and written in a neutral, descriptive tone, resulting in a clear and complete picture of the video's content.",
