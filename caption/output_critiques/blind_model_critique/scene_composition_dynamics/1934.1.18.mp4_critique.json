    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a sterile, white room with a minimalist design. The environment is dominated by a large, central monitor displaying a small, white figure against a black background. The scene features several individuals dressed in white, full-body suits with head coverings, gathered around the monitor. One person stands out with a red top hat, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochromatic setting. The atmosphere is clinical and focused, with the group intently observing the screen. The lighting is bright and even, enhancing the clean and orderly appearance of the room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"\n\nMake your output sound natural, as if written by a thoughtful human. Keep the tone conversational, clear, and professional—no stiff or overly formal language. Prioritize readability, flow, and conciseness.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully establishes the minimalist, monochromatic setting and the key subjects, but it lacks the dynamic detail expected for a video description and includes subjective interpretations. It fails to specify the point of view; for instance, it could be a slow, eye-level dolly shot moving from left to right, which would create a feeling of cinematic observation. The description is also static, missing crucial motion elements that would be present in a video. For example, the small, white figure on the monitor could be animated, running in place, and the individuals in the room might be making subtle movements, such as one pointing a gloved finger at the screen. The description of the suits as just \"white, full-body suits\" is generic; they could be more specifically described as being made of a smooth, synthetic material with integrated hoods that obscure all facial features. Similarly, the \"red top hat\" could be noted as having a felt texture, contrasting with the sleek suits. The caption violates the instructions by using subjective terms like \"clinical and focused\" and \"clean and orderly appearance.\" Finally, it could be more precise about the monitor, describing it as a large, bezel-less screen integrated into the far wall, and could mention a subtle overlay, such as a faint, green telemetry data stream scrolling in the bottom-left corner of the display.",
