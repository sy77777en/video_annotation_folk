    "pre_caption": "The video captures a lively outdoor event, likely a red carpet gathering, set in an urban environment. The scene is viewed from a broadcast POV shot, typical of television production, providing a clear and structured view of the event. It takes place during the evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The background features a large building with distinctive red and white circular patterns, possibly part of a commercial or entertainment complex. The setting is bustling with elegantly dressed attendees, suggesting a formal occasion. Notable visual elements include a prominent red carpet and a backdrop with reflective surfaces, adding to the glamorous atmosphere. Overlays are present, including a logo and text identifying the broadcast network, positioned at the bottom left corner of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A broadcast POV shot where the camera is set up for television production.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nWhile it correctly identifies many visual elements, it repeatedly violates the rules against using subjective language, making speculative statements, and inferring purpose or effect.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is likely accurate in its description of the core visual content (an evening red carpet event, a building with specific patterns, broadcast overlays). It correctly identifies the point of view and time of day.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete, covering:\n*   **Point of View:** \"broadcast POV shot\"\n*   **Environment:** \"outdoor,\" \"urban environment\"\n*   **Time of Day:** \"evening\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** \"building with distinctive red and white circular patterns,\" \"red carpet,\" \"backdrop with reflective surfaces\"\n*   **Overlays:** \"logo and text identifying the broadcast network, positioned at the bottom left corner\"\n\nHowever, it does not describe any motion, which is a required element if present. The word \"bustling\" implies motion but is a subjective interpretation rather than a neutral description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It violates multiple core instructions:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Subjective/Emotional Adjectives.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Caption:** Uses \"lively,\" \"elegantly,\" and \"glamorous.\" These words interpret the scene's mood and quality rather than describing its physical attributes.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Use of Speculative Statements.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   **Caption:** Uses \"likely a red carpet gathering,\" \"possibly part of a commercial or entertainment complex,\" and \"suggesting a formal occasion.\" These are all inferences, not direct observations.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Explaining Emphasis or Effect.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Caption:** States the POV is \"providing a clear and structured view of the event\" and that the reflective surfaces are \"adding to the glamorous atmosphere.\" Both phrases explain the *effect* of the visual elements, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation 4: Inferring the Role of the Setting.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   **Caption:** The phrase \"possibly part of a commercial or entertainment complex\" infers the building's function.\n\n### Corrected Example\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions for the same scene:\n\nFrom a broadcast point of view, an outdoor event takes place in an urban setting during the evening, illuminated by artificial light. In the background is a large building with red and white circular patterns on its facade. A red carpet is laid out on the ground, where people in formal attire are gathered near a backdrop with reflective surfaces. An overlay in the bottom left corner contains a logo and text for a broadcast network.",
