    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors, featuring a minimalist setting with plain, light-colored walls. A person is present, wearing a white outfit with orange stripes and a hood, standing near a large, white, rectangular object with metallic controls. The environment is clean and uncluttered, emphasizing the stark contrast between the white attire and the surrounding neutral tones. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting an artificial indoor light source. The scene remains static, focusing on the interaction between the person and the object, with no visible changes in time or motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, the provided caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its failings:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Incorrect Description of Motion:** The most significant error is the statement, \"The scene remains static... with no visible changes in time or motion.\" This is factually incorrect. The video clearly shows a person moving: they open the appliance door, place an item inside, close the door, and then interact with the controls. The *camera* is static, but the *scene* itself contains motion, which is a key element.\n*   **Incomplete Object Description:** While it describes a \"large, white, rectangular object,\" it omits the most prominent feature on its front: the large, round, dark glass door.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The instructions require specifying the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot). The caption fails to mention that this is a static, eye-level shot.\n*   **Omission of Action:** The instructions ask to describe human-made movements. The caption completely omits the central action of the person using the appliance, which is the entire subject of the short video.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Motion\" Description:** The caption directly contradicts the instruction to \"describe... human-made movements\" by incorrectly stating there is no motion.\n*   **Violation of \"Do Not Explain Emphasis\":** The instruction explicitly states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption violates this by saying the scene is \"emphasizing the stark contrast between the white attire and the surrounding neutral tones.\"\n*   **Failure to Include POV:** The caption fails to follow the instruction to \"indicate the point of view.\"\n*   **Use of Subjective Language:** The term \"minimalist\" is slightly subjective, though borderline acceptable. However, combined with the violation of explaining \"emphasis,\" it shows a tendency to interpret rather than describe.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is shot from a static, eye-level perspective indoors, featuring a clean and uncluttered setting with plain, light-colored walls. A person, dressed in a white outfit with orange stripes and a hood, is seen interacting with a large, white, rectangular appliance that has a prominent round, dark glass door on its front. The person opens the appliance door, places an item inside, closes the door, and then operates the metallic controls. The lighting is bright and even, indicating an artificial indoor light source.",
