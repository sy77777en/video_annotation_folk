The background is dark and out of focus, showing indistinct vertical structures, while small white specks drift downwards through the scene.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully identifies the primary subjects and their key features, but it lacks crucial details regarding the scene's composition, motion, and overall context. It fails to specify the static, third-person point of view, which frames the scene like a diorama. The description of the setting as an \"ambiguous space\" with \"indistinct vertical structures\" is too vague; a more accurate description would be a dark forest at night, with the structures being tall, slender trees that are out of focus. The caption omits any description of motion, such as the steady downward streak of the rain, the slow, horizontal drift of the white cloud across the foreground, or the subtle blinking of the large cat's eyes. Furthermore, describing the large cat as a \"close-up\" is misleading; it is a massive, looming figure that constitutes the entire background, creating a sense of scale and intimidation that the caption does not convey. The interaction between the subjects is also missed, as the smaller red cat is looking up toward the larger one. Finally, the caption fails to mention a potential text overlay, such as a title in a stylized font at the top of the scene, or a watermark in the bottom-right corner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dark forest at night, a massive, blue-gray cat with yellow eyes looms in the background, its subtle blinking adding a sense of life to the scene. The cat's presence fills the entire backdrop, creating an intimidating scale. Tall, slender trees, out of focus, form indistinct vertical lines, while rain steadily streaks downward. In the mid-ground, a smaller red cat, dressed in a devil costume complete with a cape, horns, and a matching red trident, stands on a white, cloud-like shape that drifts slowly across the foreground. The red cat gazes upward toward the larger feline, adding a dynamic interaction between the two. The scene is framed from a static, third-person point of view, resembling a diorama. A stylized title overlays the top of the scene, and a watermark is visible in the bottom-right corner.",
