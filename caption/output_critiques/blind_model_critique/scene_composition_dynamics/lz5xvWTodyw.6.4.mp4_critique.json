    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans across a dimly lit room with dark green walls and a herringbone-patterned wood floor. The space is illuminated by a single wall sconce, revealing several framed portraits of men on the walls. Furnishings include a dark wood side table with a candlestick-style telephone, a single cream-colored chair, and a large, ornate blue-and-white vase in a corner. A wooden door with a brass handle is visible to the left. Two men in period clothing are present in the room, with the character in the foreground holding a pistol.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main elements, but it misses key visual information that would be prominent in a first-person video. The description of the pistol is absent; in a first-person view, the weapon would be a constant foreground element, and its details—such as being a blued steel revolver held in the lower right of the view—are essential. The motion is described as a general \"pan,\" but the video likely shows a more deliberate movement, such as a slow pan from left to right that begins focused on the wooden door and comes to rest on the two men, building tension. The placement of the two men is also vague; their positions relative to the furniture are critical for understanding the scene's composition, for instance, if one man is standing near the side table while the other is seated in the cream-colored chair. Finally, while the single light source is mentioned, its effect is not. The video would be characterized by deep shadows cast across the herringbone floor and partially obscuring the faces in the portraits, a dramatic visual detail that is central to the dimly lit atmosphere and is currently omitted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, slowly pans from left to right across a dimly lit room with dark green walls and a herringbone-patterned wood floor. The scene begins focused on a wooden door with a brass handle and gradually reveals two men in period clothing, one standing near a dark wood side table with a candlestick-style telephone, and the other seated in a cream-colored chair. In the lower right of the view, a blued steel revolver is held prominently, a constant foreground element. The space is illuminated by a single wall sconce, casting deep shadows across the floor and partially obscuring the faces in the framed portraits of men on the walls, enhancing the dramatic atmosphere.
