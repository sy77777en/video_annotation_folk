    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features a round table covered with a white tablecloth, adorned with plates of colorful food and a glass of amber-colored drink. The restaurant's interior includes dark wooden elements and soft lighting, creating a cozy ambiance. The ceiling has a decorative design, adding to the traditional aesthetic. The scene captures a moment of dining, with subjects seated around the table, engaged in conversation. The overall environment suggests a relaxed and intimate dining experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nWhile it accurately describes some visual elements, it fails to adhere to several core negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and inference.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is unsuccessful:\n\n### 1. Adherence to Instructions (Major Failures)\n\n*   **Use of Emotional and Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule multiple times with words like \"warm, **inviting** atmosphere,\" \"**cozy** ambiance,\" and \"**relaxed** and **intimate** dining experience.\" These words describe feelings and interpretations rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Inference and Speculation:** The instructions forbid speculative statements (\"suggests\"), inferring the role of the setting, and explaining what the scene emphasizes. The caption does all of these.\n    *   `...creating a cozy ambiance.` (Explains the effect of the lighting).\n    *   `...adding to the traditional aesthetic.` (Infers a style and explains the purpose of the design).\n    *   `The overall environment suggests a relaxed and intimate dining experience.` (Uses the forbidden word \"suggests\" and makes a broad interpretation of the scene's purpose).\n    *   `...engaged in conversation.` (This is an inference about the subjects' activity. A more objective description would be \"subjects are seated and talking to one another\").\n*   **Use of Interpretive Nouns:** Words like \"atmosphere,\" \"ambiance,\" and \"aesthetic\" are interpretations of the scene's mood and style, which the instructions discourage in favor of describing the concrete elements that create them.\n\n### 2. Completeness (Missing Information)\n\n*   **Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view (e.g., first-person, eye-level shot, high-angle shot), which is a required element in the instructions.\n*   **Motion:** The caption is static. It describes a \"moment\" but does not mention any movement, such as the subjects talking, gestures, or staff moving in the background, which would likely be present in a video.\n\n### 3. Accuracy and Formatting (Minor Issues)\n\n*   **Meta-Description:** The phrase \"The scene captures a moment of dining\" is slightly meta. The instructions favor direct description of what is happening rather than describing the video's function (\"captures\").\n*   **Redundancy:** The caption mentions the \"dimly lit\" and \"soft lighting\" as well as the \"warm, inviting atmosphere\" and \"cozy ambiance.\" This is repetitive and relies on the subjective terms that should have been avoided in the first place.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption fails because it tells the viewer how to feel about the scene (\"cozy,\" \"intimate\") and interprets its meaning (\"dining experience,\" \"traditional aesthetic\") instead of providing a neutral, objective description of the visual and auditory information. A good caption, according to the rules, would describe the dark wood, the specific decorative ceiling pattern, the color of the light, and the placement of the subjects, allowing the viewer to make their own interpretations.",
