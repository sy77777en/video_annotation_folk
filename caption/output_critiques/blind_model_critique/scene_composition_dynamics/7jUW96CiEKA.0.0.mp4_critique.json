    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene featuring a large, leafless tree with thick, textured branches extending outward against a clear blue sky. The tree's bark is rough and gray, with distinctive markings and a robust trunk. Sunlight filters through the branches, creating lens flares and subtle shadows on the tree's surface. The setting is serene and natural, with no visible human-made structures or movement, emphasizing the tree's grandeur and the open sky. The time of day appears to be midday, as indicated by the bright, direct sunlight illuminating the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good attempt, but the caption fails to follow several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual content. It logically describes a common outdoor scene (a large tree against the sky) and includes plausible details like textured bark, lens flares from the sun, and the absence of man-made structures. Assuming the video matches this description, the caption is factually accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one required element:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly ask to indicate the point of view (e.g., first-person, low-angle shot, static shot). The caption does not mention the camera's position or movement, which is a significant omission. For example, it could be a low-angle shot looking up, a static shot, or a slow pan.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues. It violates several specific negative constraints.\n\n**Violations:**\n1.  **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses **\"serene\"** to describe the setting and **\"grandeur\"** to describe the tree. Both are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood and impact.\n\n2.  **Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The caption contains the phrase **\"...emphasizing the tree's grandeur and the open sky.\"** This is a direct violation, as it interprets the artistic or narrative purpose of the composition rather than simply describing what is visible.\n\n3.  **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instruction states, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   The caption says, \"The time of day **appears to be** midday...\" This is speculative language. It should be stated directly, such as \"The time of day is midday...\"\n\n**Positive Adherence:**\n*   The caption successfully avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It combines details into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It correctly identifies the environment (outdoors), time of day (midday), and key visual elements (tree, bark, sky, sunlight).\n*   It uses simple, natural English for the most part.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to critical negative constraints outlined in the instructions, specifically by including subjective/emotional words, explaining the scene's emphasis, and using speculative language. It is also incomplete as it omits the required description of the point of view.\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that adheres to all instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nFrom a static, low-angle point of view, this outdoor video shows a large, leafless tree against a clear blue sky during midday. The tree has a thick trunk and branches with rough, gray, textured bark. Bright, direct sunlight filters through the branches, creating lens flares and casting shadows on the trunk's surface. There are no human-made structures or visible movement in the scene.",
