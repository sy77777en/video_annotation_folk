    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene featuring a large, leafless tree with thick, textured branches extending outward against a clear blue sky. The tree's bark is rough and gray, with distinctive markings and a robust trunk. Sunlight filters through the branches, creating lens flares and subtle shadows on the tree's surface. The setting is serene and natural, with no visible human-made structures or movement, emphasizing the tree's grandeur and the open sky. The time of day appears to be midday, as indicated by the bright, direct sunlight illuminating the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation but misses several key visual details that define the scene's perspective and atmosphere. It fails to mention the low-angle point of view, which positions the viewer at the base of the trunk looking up, making the tree appear more imposing. The description of the ground is completely omitted; the base of the tree is surrounded by a carpet of dry, brown leaves with patches of green grass visible at the bottom of the shot. While the caption states the sky is \"clear blue,\" a few thin, wispy clouds are drifting slowly across it. It also incorrectly states there is no movement, as the smaller branches can be seen swaying gently in a breeze. The description of \"lens flares\" is accurate, but it could also note that they shift slightly as the camera performs a very slow upward tilt. Furthermore, the caption violates the instructions by using the subjective term \"grandeur\" and explaining that the scene is \"emphasizing\" a quality. Finally, it overlooks a semi-transparent watermark with a creator's handle located in the bottom-right corner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an outdoor scene from a low-angle perspective, positioning the viewer at the base of a large, leafless tree, looking up. This viewpoint makes the tree appear imposing, with its thick, textured branches extending outward against a sky that is mostly clear blue, with a few thin, wispy clouds drifting slowly across it. The tree's bark is rough and gray, marked with distinctive patterns, and its robust trunk is surrounded by a carpet of dry, brown leaves, with patches of green grass visible at the bottom of the shot.
