    "pre_caption": "The video captures a dynamic scene in a snowy, forested landscape during the day. It is shot from a selfie POV, with the camera facing the person holding it, who is skiing through deep, powdery snow. Tall evergreen trees, heavily laden with snow, frame the scene, creating a dense, wintry backdrop. The skier, dressed in blue and wearing goggles, moves swiftly, causing snow to spray up around them, adding a sense of motion and energy. The overcast sky casts a soft, diffused light over the scene, enhancing the whiteness of the snow and the dark green of the trees. The overall atmosphere is one of exhilarating movement through a pristine, snow-covered forest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A selfie POV shot where the camera is facing the person holding it.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the selfie point of view and the general snowy forest setting, but it misses several key visual details and misrepresents the camera's movement. The point of view is not static; it is captured by a 360-degree camera on an extension pole that periodically rotates, shifting from the snowboarder's face to a forward-facing perspective that shows them skillfully navigating a tight path between the evergreen trees. The description of the snowboarder is incomplete, as it omits their black helmet and the distinctive, mirrored rainbow lens of their goggles. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the vibrant, abstract graphic visible on the underside of the snowboard during sharp turns. While the sky is overcast, glimpses of a distant, rocky mountain peak can be seen through clearings in the forest, adding depth to the landscape. Finally, the video includes a small, semi-transparent brand watermark in the lower-right corner and a minimalist speedometer overlay in the top-left, both of which are unmentioned in the current description.",
