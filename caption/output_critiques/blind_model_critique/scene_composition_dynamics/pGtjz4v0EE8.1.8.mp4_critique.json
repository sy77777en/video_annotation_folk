    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, exploring an opulent indoor setting, likely a historic museum or gallery. The environment is richly decorated, featuring high, ornate ceilings adorned with intricate frescoes and gold accents. The walls are lined with detailed artwork and decorative panels, contributing to the grandeur of the space. Large windows allow natural light to flood the room, highlighting the polished stone floors and the elegant architectural details. Visitors are scattered throughout, some observing the art, adding a sense of scale and activity. The atmosphere is serene and contemplative, with the focus on the artistic and architectural elements. Overlay elements include text and icons, positioned unobtrusively at the edges, providing additional context without detracting from the visual experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have just watched.\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the first-person point of view and the presence of black vignettes, it relies on speculative and subjective language, which should be avoided. The phrase \"likely a historic museum or gallery\" is an inference; it would be more accurate to describe the setting as \"a large hall with high, frescoed ceilings and walls lined with large, classical oil paintings in ornate gold frames.\" Adjectives like \"opulent,\" \"richly,\" \"grandeur,\" and \"elegant\" are subjective and should be replaced with more concrete descriptions. For instance, instead of just \"polished stone floors,\" the caption could specify \"polished black and white checkerboard marble floors.\" The description misses key architectural features visible in the video, such as the series of large marble columns and archways that line the hall, and it fails to mention the prominent white marble sculpture of a mythological figure positioned in the center of the room. The caption also explains the *effect* of the elements (e.g., \"contributing to the grandeur,\" \"enhancing the immersive experience\"), which is interpretive. Finally, while it mentions \"exploring,\" it doesn't describe the actual motion, which is a slow, continuous forward movement through the hall, with the camera panning slightly to observe the paintings and ceiling details.",
