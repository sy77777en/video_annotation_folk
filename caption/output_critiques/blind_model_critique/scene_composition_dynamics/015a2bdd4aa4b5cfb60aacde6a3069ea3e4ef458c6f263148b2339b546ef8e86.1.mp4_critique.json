    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a scenic coastal landscape. It features a small, rocky peninsula jutting into a deep blue sea, surrounded by clear waters with visible underwater formations. The peninsula is covered with lush green vegetation and houses a solitary, modest building with a light-colored roof, blending naturally with the environment. The coastline is rugged, with steep cliffs and a backdrop of distant hills under a clear sky, suggesting a calm, sunny day. The expansive view highlights the natural beauty and isolation of the setting, with a few boats dotting the horizon, adding a sense of scale and tranquility to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the drone point of view and the general coastal setting, it includes subjective interpretations and misses several key visual details. The use of terms like \"scenic,\" \"modest,\" \"beautiful,\" and \"tranquility\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional language, and the final sentence explains what the scene emphasizes rather than simply describing it. The description is also static, failing to mention that the drone is in motion, slowly orbiting the peninsula from a high angle, which causes the perspective on the landscape to shift continuously. Furthermore, the description of the building is vague; it is a distinct white stucco structure with a red terracotta tile roof, not just a \"light-colored\" one. The \"lush green vegetation\" is more specifically a mix of low-lying shrubs and a few scattered cypress trees. The caption also omits the detail that one of the boats is a sailboat with its sails down, while another is a motor yacht leaving a white wake on the water's surface. Finally, it fails to mention the semi-transparent watermark for a creator's handle located in the bottom-right corner of the video.",
