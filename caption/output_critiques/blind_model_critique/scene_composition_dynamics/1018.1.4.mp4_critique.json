    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a compact, utilitarian kitchen area with muted green walls and metal cabinets. The lighting is soft, suggesting an artificial source typical of indoor settings. The environment includes a countertop with various kitchen items like plates and a kettle, indicating a functional space. The scene features two individuals, one wearing a Santa hat, adding a festive touch. The other person is dressed in a uniform with a vest and tie, suggesting a formal or professional context. The overall atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or changes in the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding speculation, subjectivity, and inference.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the visual details (green walls, metal cabinets, Santa hat, uniform) are present in the video, the description is factually accurate.\n\n**Completeness (What's Missing):**\n*   **Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view (e.g., eye-level, high-angle, fixed shot), which is a required element in the instructions.\n*   **Time of Day:** The caption does not state the time of day. While it mentions \"artificial source\" of light, it doesn't commit to a specific time like \"day\" or \"night,\" which may be appropriate if it's not discernible, but it is an omission from the requested details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions (Where it Fails):**\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses phrases like \"**suggesting** an artificial source,\" \"**indicating** a functional space,\" and \"**suggesting** a formal or professional context.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative language. The description should state what is visible, not what the visuals imply.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"...suggesting an artificial source...\"\n    *   **Should be:** \"...under soft, artificial light.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The phrase \"**indicating a functional space**\" infers the purpose of the kitchen rather than simply describing it. The presence of a kettle and plates already shows it's a kitchen; labeling it \"functional\" is an unnecessary inference.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption describes the atmosphere as \"**calm**\" and the Santa hat as adding a \"**festive touch**.\" These are subjective interpretations of the mood and the symbolic meaning of an object, which the instructions prohibit. The word \"**utilitarian**\" is also a subjective classification of the kitchen's style.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The phrase \"**adding a festive touch**\" explains the *effect* of the Santa hat on the scene, which is explicitly disallowed.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nA better caption that strictly follows all instructions would look like this:\n\n**\"From a fixed, eye-level point of view, the scene is set indoors within a compact kitchen with muted green walls and metal cabinets under soft, artificial light. On a countertop are plates and a kettle. Two individuals are present; one wears a red and white Santa hat, and the other wears a uniform consisting of a vest and tie. The scene is static, with no movement.\"**\n\nThis revised version is better because it:\n1.  **Adds the Point of View.**\n2.  **Removes all speculative words** (\"suggesting,\" \"indicating\").\n3.  **Removes all subjective/interpretive words** (\"utilitarian,\" \"functional,\" \"festive,\" \"calm\").\n4.  **Describes objects and clothing directly** without inferring their meaning or context.\n5.  Remains concise and focuses only on observable facts.",
