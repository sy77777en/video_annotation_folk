    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It meticulously follows every rule and constraint, resulting in a description that is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly aligned with the prompt's requirements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a scene that is clearly from a first-person video game (likely a modern military shooter like *Call of Duty*).\n*   It correctly identifies the **night vision** effect (\"monochromatic green hue\").\n*   It precisely describes the environmental elements: a **stone walkway**, a **large building with columns and windows**, and **dense bushes and trees**.\n*   The description of the subject's presence (\"gloved hands and a rifle with a sight\") is accurate for this genre and point of view.\n*   It correctly identifies and transcribes the content of the **heads-up display (HUD)** elements, such as the compass, objective markers (\"Search Church,\" \"Find Hadir\"), and the \"Checkpoint reached\" notification.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the key details requested in the instructions without adding extraneous information.\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Described as a \"dark, outdoor location\" with specific architectural and natural features.\n*   **Time of Day:** Explicitly mentioned as \"at night.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The night vision effect and the character's weapon are well-described.\n*   **Overlays:** The HUD elements are identified as overlays, and their placement and content are detailed perfectly.\n*   **Motion:** The movement of the camera (\"moves through,\" \"proceeds along\") and the temporary nature of the notification (\"briefly appears\") are included, indicating a summary of a video clip rather than a static image.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption truly excels. It demonstrates a perfect understanding of the negative and positive constraints.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is dense with information but remains clear and easy to read.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** The primary focus is on the environment, with the character's hands and weapon described as part of the view, not the central subject.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words like \"eerie,\" \"tense,\" or \"dangerous.\" It uses neutral descriptors like \"dark,\" \"large,\" and \"dense.\"\n*   **No Speculation or Inference:** The caption describes a \"large building\" and notes the overlay says \"Search Church,\" but it does not infer that the building *is* the church or speculate on the character's role (e.g., \"soldier,\" \"operative\"). It strictly reports what is visible.\n*   **No \"Image\" or \"Frame\":** These terms are correctly avoided.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is straightforward and professional.\n*   **Correct Handling of Overlays:** It explicitly states the HUD elements are \"overlaid on the screen,\" perfectly following the instruction.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, clean paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is a precise, objective, and comprehensive description that fulfills every requirement of the prompt.",
