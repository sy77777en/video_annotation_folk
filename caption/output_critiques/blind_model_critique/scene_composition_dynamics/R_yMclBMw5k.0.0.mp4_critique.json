    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres to most of the instructions. It is accurate, concise, and descriptive. However, there are two minor areas where it deviates slightly from the strict guidelines.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes a scene with a black background, a flowing stream of golden particles, their movement in an arc, their visual properties (size, brightness, shimmer), the shallow depth of field, and the presence of a warm glow.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It covers all the necessary visual information for an abstract scene like this. It correctly identifies the background as the setting and describes the primary moving elements (the particles) and lighting. It appropriately omits irrelevant details like time of day, weather, or a physical location.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions well, but with two small exceptions:\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the entire scene in a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly focuses on the abstract setting and the particles rather than any specific subject.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to specific moments in time.\n*   **Motion Described:** The phrase \"flows in a gentle arc\" clearly describes the motion within the video.\n*   **Simple Language:** The English is natural and easy to understand.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1.  **Avoids Speculative Statements:** The instruction states to avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or 'there might be.' The caption uses the phrase \"A faint, warm light source is **suggested** off-screen.\" The word \"suggested\" is a form of inference. A more compliant approach would be to describe only what is visible.\n    *   **Correction:** Instead of describing the *suggested source*, describe its *visible effect*. For example: \"A faint, warm glow emanates from the upper right.\"\n\n2.  **Avoids Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption states that the particles \"**create a sense of depth** with a shallow focus.\" This phrase explains the *purpose* or *effect* of the shallow focus, which falls under explaining what the scene highlights.\n    *   **Correction:** It is better to state the observable fact directly. The caption already does this well in the next clause (\"where some are sharp and others are softly blurred\"). The phrase \"create a sense of depth\" is redundant and explanatory. Simply removing it would make the caption more compliant.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\nHere is a revised version of the caption that fully adheres to all instructions:\n\nAgainst a solid black background, a stream of shimmering golden particles flows in a gentle arc from the upper left towards the lower right. The particles, varying in size and brightness, are rendered with a shallow focus, where some are sharp and others are softly blurred. A subtle, warm glow emanates from the upper right of the scene.",
