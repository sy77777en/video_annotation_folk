    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. The details provided—a drone shot of a snow-covered mountain with a jagged peak, exposed rock, glaciers, and drifting clouds—are specific and create a clear mental picture that aligns with such a video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and covers all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"filmed by a drone.\"\n*   **Motion:** Effectively described with \"moves alongside\" for the camera and \"drifting\" for the clouds.\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Clearly established as an outdoor scene featuring a \"towering, snow-covered mountain.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Implied as daytime through the mention of a \"deep blue sky.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The mountain peak, rocky faces, snow, ice, glaciers, and clouds are all described with specific details about their shape (\"sharp and jagged\"), color (\"dark,\" \"white,\" \"deep blue\"), and features (\"exposed beneath a thick layer\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the negative and positive constraints of the instructions with exceptional precision.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is brief yet packed with descriptive detail.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description is entirely focused on the setting and natural elements, as requested.\n*   **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"majestic\") and instead uses descriptive, factual words (\"towering,\" \"sharp,\" \"jagged\").\n*   **No Speculation or Forbidden Terms:** The caption avoids speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"might be\") and forbidden words (\"image,\" \"frame\").\n*   **Formatting:** It is delivered as a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes the visual information into a single, flowing description of the entire video rather than a frame-by-frame analysis.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, descriptive, objective, and complete.",
