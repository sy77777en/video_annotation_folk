    "pre_caption": "In an urban setting at dusk, a black sedan is parked on a paved surface, facing the camera. The car's distinctively shaped white headlights are on, contrasting with its dark body, which is mostly in shadow. In the background, the silhouette of a large, modern cable-stayed bridge with tall, angled pylons and numerous cables is visible against a bright, pale sky. A multi-story building stands on the right, and dark foliage is present on both sides of the car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a high-quality description that successfully adheres to nearly all the complex requirements of the instruction.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as urban, the time as dusk, and the subject as a black sedan. The descriptions of the key visual elements are precise, such as the \"distinctively shaped white headlights,\" the \"modern cable-stayed bridge with tall, angled pylons,\" and the \"bright, pale sky.\" All described elements are present and correctly placed.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the overall scene, the primary subject (car), the most prominent background feature (bridge), and secondary elements (building, foliage). It successfully integrates details about the environment (paved surface), time of day, and the state of objects (headlights on, car in shadow, bridge in silhouette).\n\n*   **Adherence to the Instruction:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is informative without being overly wordy.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It masterfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. Words like \"large\" and \"modern\" are used as objective descriptors of the bridge's scale and style, not as subjective praise.\n    *   **Focus:** The focus remains on the setting and scenery, treating the car as an integral part of the scene rather than a narrative subject.\n    *   **Detailing:** It follows the instructions to describe color (\"black sedan,\" \"white headlights\"), shape (\"angled pylons\"), and distinguishing features (\"silhouette\") of notable elements.\n    *   **Formatting and Prohibited Terms:** It correctly returns a single paragraph without markdown, introductory text, or forbidden words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"appears.\"\n    *   **Point of View:** The only minor point is that it doesn't explicitly state the point of view (e.g., \"a static, eye-level shot\"). However, the instruction states to include this \"if relevant,\" and the clear, stable description implicitly conveys the static nature of the scene, making this a negligible omission.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary execution of the provided instructions. It is accurate, detailed, objective, and well-structured.",
