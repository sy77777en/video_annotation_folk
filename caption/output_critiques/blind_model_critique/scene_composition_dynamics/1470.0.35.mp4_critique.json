    "pre_caption": "The video is set in a bright, vintage-style kitchen with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features a yellow door and patterned wallpaper, adding a retro touch. A large, cream-colored refrigerator stands prominently on the right, with a smooth, glossy surface. A wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left, contributing to the cozy, domestic setting. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue flowers adds a pop of color on a countertop. The scene captures a moment of activity, with several people interacting, enhancing the lively, familial ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nWhile it successfully describes the scene in a single paragraph, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Cannot be determined.** The accuracy of the visual details (yellow door, cream refrigerator, blue flowers, etc.) cannot be verified without seeing the video. This feedback focuses solely on how the caption follows the provided writing instructions.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The caption is reasonably complete in its scope. It identifies the setting (kitchen), time of day (daytime), notable objects (refrigerator, table, door, wallpaper), and the presence of subjects (people interacting).\n*   It does not mention a specific point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld) or any overlay elements, which may or may not be present in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several core instructions:\n\n1.  **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption is filled with subjective language that the instructions explicitly forbid.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...a **warm, inviting** atmosphere,\" \"...**cozy**, domestic setting,\" \"...**lively, familial** ambiance.\" These words describe feelings and interpretations rather than objective facts. The word \"bright\" is also subjective.\n\n2.  **Do Not Infer the Role of the Scene Setting or Explain What it Emphasizes:** The caption repeatedly explains the *effect* or *purpose* of visual elements instead of just describing them.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...patterned wallpaper, **adding a retro touch**,\" \"...dining table... **contributing to the cozy, domestic setting**,\" \"...vase with blue flowers **adds a pop of color**,\" \"...people interacting, **enhancing the lively, familial ambiance**.\" These phrases explain *why* an element is there or what it does, which is forbidden.\n\n3.  **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The instruction is to avoid phrases like \"it appears\" or \"suggests.\"\n    *   **Example:** \"The lighting **suggests** daytime...\" This is a speculative statement. It should be stated more directly, such as \"The scene is set during the daytime, illuminated by natural light from a window.\"\n\n4.  **Avoid Subjective Adverbs:**\n    *   **Example:** \"...**softly** illuminating the space.\" The word \"softly\" is an interpretation of the light's quality.\n\nIn summary, the caption writer focused on creating a mood and interpreting the scene's meaning, which directly contradicts the instructions to provide a simple, objective, and factual description. A good caption, according to the rules, would describe the same elements without the emotional language and interpretive explanations.",
