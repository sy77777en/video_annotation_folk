    "pre_caption": "The video is set in a bright, vintage-style kitchen with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features a yellow door and patterned wallpaper, adding a retro touch. A large, cream-colored refrigerator stands prominently on the right, with a smooth, glossy surface. A wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left, contributing to the cozy, domestic setting. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue flowers adds a pop of color on a countertop. The scene captures a moment of activity, with several people interacting, enhancing the lively, familial ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies several key objects and the time of day, but it misses crucial details and violates the instructions by including subjective and interpretive language. The point of view is not mentioned; for instance, the video could be from a static, eye-level perspective which makes the viewer feel like they are standing in the room. The caption uses emotional and speculative phrases like \"warm, inviting atmosphere,\" \"retro touch,\" \"cozy, domestic setting,\" and \"lively, familial ambiance,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions. While it mentions a yellow door being opened, it doesn't describe the motion clearly, such as a person entering the frame to open it. The description of the people is vague and interpretive (\"interacting,\" \"familial ambiance\") instead of providing their placement and context neutrally, such as \"two adults and a child are seated at the table.\" Furthermore, significant environmental details are missing; the caption could have specified the material and pattern of the floor, such as black-and-white checkered linoleum, and the color of the walls, like a pale green. The window that is the source of the natural light in the main room is also not described, only implied. The description of the flowers as adding a \"pop of color\" is stylistic rather than descriptive. A better caption would state the point of view, remove all subjective language, and add specific, observable details about the environment and the motion within the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is filmed from a static, eye-level perspective, giving the viewer the impression of standing in the room. The setting is a bright kitchen with vintage-style decor. A yellow door is visible, and a person enters the frame to open it. The walls are painted a pale green, and the floor is covered with black-and-white checkered linoleum. A large, cream-colored refrigerator with a glossy surface is positioned on the right side of the room. On the left, a wooden dining table with chairs is present. Natural light enters through a window, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue flowers is placed on a countertop. Two adults and a child are seated at the table, engaging in conversation.",
