The buildings feature wooden elements and storefronts with glass display cases.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it fails to follow some key instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description of the visual elements (buildings, lanterns, bicycles, pedestrians, autumn leaves) is accurate and detailed. It correctly identifies colors, materials, and distinguishing features as requested.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete, covering the setting, time of day, and notable elements. However, it is missing one required detail:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions state, \"If relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" The caption does not specify the POV, which is a crucial element for describing how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates one of the most critical negative constraints:\n*   **Speculative Statements:** The phrase \"**likely in Japan**\" is a direct violation of the instruction: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" While the visual cues strongly suggest the location, the instruction requires you to describe only what is explicitly visible. Instead of guessing the country, you should describe the features that imply it (e.g., \"traditional East Asian-style architecture,\" \"paper lanterns with characters\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written and descriptive but is not \"good\" in the context of the strict instructions provided. Its primary failure is the inclusion of a speculative statement about the location (\"likely in Japan\"). A secondary issue is the omission of the point of view. To be compliant, the caption must remove the location guess and add a description of the camera's perspective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a daytime street scene in an outdoor setting, featuring traditional East Asian-style architecture. Pedestrians walk along a paved sidewalk next to buildings housing shops, which include wooden elements and storefronts with glass display cases. Several paper lanterns, both white with red and black characters and yellow/orange with black characters, hang from the eaves. Two white bicycles are parked near one of the shops. Trees with autumn leaves are visible in the background. The scene is presented from a street-level perspective, providing a view as if the viewer is walking along the sidewalk.",
