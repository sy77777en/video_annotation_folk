    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a large, industrial greenhouse-like structure. The environment is characterized by a long, arched ceiling made of transparent material, allowing diffused light to illuminate the space. The interior is lined with metal railings forming narrow pathways, suggesting an organized, utilitarian design. The atmosphere is dim, indicating an overcast day or artificial lighting. The scene includes motion, with a figure moving along the central path, emphasizing the linear perspective of the setting. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom, displaying text in both Chinese and English, such as \"Keep going!\" These overlays are not part of the physical environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\nThe caption is **good** as it accurately captures the main essence of the scene. However, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, and it omits one required piece of information.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy and Completeness:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The description of the setting as an \"indoor... large, industrial greenhouse-like structure\" is accurate and descriptive.\n    *   The details about the \"long, arched ceiling made of transparent material,\" \"diffused light,\" and \"metal railings forming narrow pathways\" are all correct and well-observed.\n    *   It correctly identifies the motion of the figure and the presence of overlays, including their content (\"Keep going!\") and languages (Chinese and English).\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Omissions):**\n    *   **Point of View (POV):** The caption fails to mention the point of view, which is a specific requirement of the instructions (\"indicate the point of view, such as first-person...\"). The video is shot from a static, eye-level perspective looking straight down the corridor.\n\n**2. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption violates several specific negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Speculative Language**\n    *   **Caption:** \"...suggesting an organized, utilitarian design.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'...\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The word \"suggesting\" is an inference about the design's intent rather than a direct description of its appearance.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Ambiguous Options**\n    *   **Caption:** \"...indicating an overcast day or artificial lighting.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" Presenting two possibilities for the light source directly contradicts this rule. It should simply describe the quality of the light (dim, diffused).\n\n*   **Violation 3: Explaining Emphasis**\n    *   **Caption:** \"...emphasizing the linear perspective of the setting.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" This phrase is an artistic interpretation of the scene's composition, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n\n*   **Minor Violation 4: Introductory Text**\n    *   **Caption:** \"The video depicts...\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" While minor, this phrase is unnecessary and could be omitted for greater conciseness.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that adheres to all the instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the scene is set indoors within a long, industrial structure with an arched, transparent ceiling that allows for dim, diffused light. The concrete floor is flanked by metal railings that create a narrow central pathway extending into the distance. A figure moves away from the camera along this path. At the bottom of the scene, overlays display subtitles in both Chinese and English, including the text \"Keep going!\".",
