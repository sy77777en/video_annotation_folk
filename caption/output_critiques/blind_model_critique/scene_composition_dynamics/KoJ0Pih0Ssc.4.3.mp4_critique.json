    "pre_caption": "This outdoor daytime scene is set along a high, grey concrete wall on sandy ground. In the foreground, a long strip of wire mesh with upward-pointing spikes is laid on the ground. Parallel to this, a line of dark, metallic Czech hedgehog obstacles and a chain-link fence extend into the distance, where city buildings and a guard tower are visible under a bright, partly cloudy sky. As the view tilts upward, a blue rectangular overlay with the white text \"SIGNAL FENCE\" appears in the lower portion of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key elements present in the scene: the grey concrete wall, sandy ground, wire mesh with spikes, Czech hedgehog obstacles, chain-link fence, distant buildings, and a guard tower. The description of the sky as \"bright, partly cloudy\" is also precise. The description of the overlay—its color, content (\"SIGNAL FENCE\"), and placement—is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It successfully covers the environment (outdoor), setting (along a wall), time of day (daytime), and notable visual elements. It describes the color, material, and shape of the obstacles as instructed. It also effectively captures the motion within the video by noting that \"the view tilts upward,\" which leads to the appearance of the overlay.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to the given rules.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and instead describes the scene holistically.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than subjects.\n    *   It uses objective, descriptive language (e.g., \"high, grey concrete wall,\" \"dark, metallic\") and avoids emotional or speculative words.\n    *   It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay\" and describes its properties and content.\n    *   It successfully describes the camera motion (\"the view tilts upward\") as a key part of the video's action.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction asks to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" While the caption describes the camera's movement, it does not explicitly label the point of view (e.g., \"From a first-person perspective...\"). This is a minor omission in an otherwise excellent description.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, detailed, and follows nearly all instructions with precision. Its descriptive language creates a clear and objective picture of the scene and its progression. The only minor point of improvement would be to explicitly state the point of view at the beginning of the description.",
