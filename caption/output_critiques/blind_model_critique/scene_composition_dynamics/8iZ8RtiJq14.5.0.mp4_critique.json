    "pre_caption": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the scene is set inside a small, artificially lit shop. A figure with a featureless, metallic silver head and hands stands behind a wooden counter, wearing a light blue shirt and a white tie. The background features a brick wall and various product displays. To the left, a turquoise shelf holds boxes of chocolate with the word \"Cacao\" on the packaging. On and behind the counter, smaller displays contain colorful boxes of candy and a green box labeled \"Cigars.\" An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays a white text caption.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively and accurately follows the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is successful:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption provides a comprehensive and factually correct description of the scene. It successfully identifies the point of view, the indoor shop setting, the artificial lighting, and key visual elements like the brick wall, product displays, and the specific items on them (\"Cacao\" chocolate, \"Cigars\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:**\n    *   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"over-the-shoulder POV\" and explains what the viewer sees from that perspective.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The description is neutral and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., it says \"metallic silver head,\" not \"creepy head\"). It also avoids speculation, as instructed.\n    *   **Focus on Setting:** While it describes the central figure, it does so in the context of the scene's composition (\"stands behind a wooden counter\") and focuses on its physical appearance (color, material) rather than its identity or actions, which aligns with the instruction to prioritize the setting.\n    *   **Detail and Specificity:** The caption excels at describing notable elements with precision, mentioning color (\"light blue shirt,\" \"turquoise shelf\"), material (\"metallic silver,\" \"wooden counter\"), and markings (\"word 'Cacao'\").\n    *   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the text at the bottom as an \"overlay,\" separating it from the scene's diegetic elements.\n\n*   **Formatting and Style:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not include any introductory text or Markdown formatting.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that meets all the specified criteria. It is concise yet informative, objective, and detailed, creating a clear mental image of the video's content without violating any of the negative constraints.",
