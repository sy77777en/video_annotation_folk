    "pre_caption": "From an over-the-shoulder point of view, the scene is set within a dimly lit indoor establishment, likely a bar or diner at night. The environment is characterized by warm, muted lighting with prominent green and yellow hues, and a soft red light glows in the background. A man wearing a cream-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt with black geometric patterns sits at a red booth. The background is softly blurred, showing the indistinct figures of other patrons, including one in a multi-colored striped shirt. Yellow subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the screen, displaying the dialogue: \"Don't drool on it just lick it man. Come on.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is that the caption is a good start but misses key details and violates a core instruction. The use of \"likely a bar or diner\" is speculative and should be replaced with descriptions of concrete elements that define the space, such as the visible wooden bar counter, rows of glass bottles in the background, and the specific design of the light fixtures casting the green and yellow glow. The description is also too static; it fails to mention the subtle, continuous handheld camera movement that adds a sense of immediacy, or the subject's action of attempting to roll a piece of paper, which directly corresponds to the dialogue in the subtitles. Furthermore, while identifying the over-the-shoulder point of view, the caption omits the crucial framing element of the shoulder itself—a dark-clothed shoulder and part of an arm are visible in the foreground on the right, grounding the perspective. Finally, the description of the red booth could be more specific by noting its worn, cracked vinyl texture, and the table in front of the man has a glass of amber liquid on it, which is a significant prop that adds context to the setting.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with a dark-clothed shoulder and part of an arm visible in the foreground on the right, grounding the viewer's perspective.

In front of him, a glass of amber liquid sits on the table, a significant prop that enhances the scene's context.
