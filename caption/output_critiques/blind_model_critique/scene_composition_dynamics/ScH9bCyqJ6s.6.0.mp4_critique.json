    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors, focusing closely on a small, metallic electronic component with a rectangular shape and rounded edges. The component features a shiny silver surface with a smooth texture, interrupted by a small, glass-covered window displaying a blue, patterned detail inside. The surrounding area includes a matte black material with a slightly rough texture, likely part of the device’s casing. Human fingers are visible, holding the component gently, with natural skin tones and fine lines apparent. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the metallic sheen and the blue detail within the window. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **very good** and adheres closely to the vast majority of the detailed instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description is precise and objective. It uses descriptive but neutral language to detail the visual elements, such as \"shiny silver surface,\" \"matte black material,\" and \"natural skin tones.\" The details about the component's shape (rectangular with rounded edges), the glass window, and the blue pattern inside are specific and create a clear mental image that is verifiably accurate to the described scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully covers all the required aspects:\n*   **Setting:** Clearly states \"indoors.\"\n*   **Point of View:** Effectively describes a \"close-up\" perspective without using technical jargon.\n*   **Notable Elements:** Provides a thorough description of the electronic component, its materials, colors, and textures, as well as the surrounding casing and the human fingers.\n*   **Lighting:** Notes the \"bright and even\" lighting and its effect on the surfaces.\n*   **Overlays:** Correctly confirms the absence of any overlays, text, or other graphics.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions with a high degree of fidelity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   The focus remains on the setting and scenery, with the subject (fingers) described only in context.\n*   The language is simple, natural, and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It successfully combines details into a unified description of the scene.\n\n**Minor Areas for Improvement:**\nThere are two very minor points where the caption could be adjusted for perfect adherence:\n\n1.  **Use of \"likely\":** The instruction states to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" The phrase \"**likely** part of the device’s casing\" is a minor speculation. A stricter adherence would be to describe only what is visible, for example: \"The component is set against a matte black material with a slightly rough texture.\"\n2.  **Use of \"highlighting\":** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The sentence \"The lighting is bright and even, **highlighting** the metallic sheen...\" uses a forbidden keyword. While it's used to describe the effect of the light, a more compliant alternative would be: \"The lighting is bright and even, which makes the metallic sheen and the blue detail within the window visible.\"\n\nDespite these minor points, the caption is an excellent example of how to follow the complex set of rules provided. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the requirements for creating a descriptive, objective, and comprehensive video caption.",
