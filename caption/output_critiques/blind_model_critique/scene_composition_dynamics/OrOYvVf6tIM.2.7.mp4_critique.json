    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** In a dimly lit room with a white-beamed ceiling, a man in a dark, long-sleeved shirt leans over an open cardboard box. A bright, cool-toned light emanates from within the box, casting an upward glow onto his face and contrasting with the surrounding darkness of the interior space.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and follows the provided instructions with a high degree of precision.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is entirely accurate. It correctly identifies the dimly lit room, the white-beamed ceiling, the man's clothing and posture, the cardboard box, and the nature of the light (bright, cool-toned, emanating from within the box) and its effect (upward glow).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete, successfully capturing all the essential elements of the scene. It establishes the setting, environment, and the primary visual focus (the light from the box) without getting lost in unnecessary detail. It correctly omits descriptions of motion or transitions, as there are none.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery, describing the subject only in relation to the scene.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. Phrases like \"dimly lit,\" \"cool-toned,\" and \"bright\" are objective descriptions of the visual information. The mention of the light \"contrasting with the surrounding darkness\" is a factual observation of the visual composition, not a subjective interpretation.\n    *   **Negative Constraints:** The caption successfully avoids forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), does not infer the purpose of the scene, and does not explain what the scene emphasizes in an interpretive way.\n    *   **Point of View:** The only element from the instructions not explicitly included is the point of view (a static, eye-level shot). However, the instruction states to include this \"if relevant,\" and for a simple, static scene like this, its omission does not detract from the quality of the description.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and objective, perfectly translating the visual information into a concise text description.",
