    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down from a high altitude onto a vast, paved area on a sunny day. The ground, composed of cracked concrete slabs with yellow painted lines, is set up with various ramps and obstacles. On the left, a large blue ramp sits next to a white building. Other smaller black and blue ramps are scattered across the lot, along with a circular white landing target with a black center. The paved area is surrounded by dry, brown earth. As the perspective moves, the shadow of a person attached to a parachute becomes visible on the ground below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the first-person perspective is slightly redundant and could be made more immersive by including elements of the parachutist that would likely be visible, such as the colorful canopy fabric at the top of the view or their legs dangling below. The phrase 'the perspective moves' is too general; specifying the motion as a 'steady descent' or 'gliding downward' would better capture the action in the video. While the caption notes the ramps and obstacles, it could be more specific by identifying them as part of a potential stunt course or skatepark, which seems to be their function, and describing the 'cracked concrete' as an airfield runway or a large, weathered lot would add useful context. The appearance of the shadow is a key detail, but its description could be integrated more smoothly with the descent, perhaps noting how it grows in size and clarity as the ground approaches, which would enhance the sense of decreasing altitude. Lastly, the description of the 'white building' lacks scale; clarifying if it is a large hangar or a smaller administrative structure would provide better context for the landing zone.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A first-person POV shot captures the exhilarating experience of a parachutist gliding steadily downward from a high altitude on a sunny day. The colorful canopy fabric is visible at the top of the view, while the parachutist's legs dangle below. The descent reveals a vast, weathered airfield runway, marked by cracked concrete slabs and yellow painted lines, set up as a potential stunt course or skatepark. Various ramps and obstacles are scattered across the lot, including a large blue ramp adjacent to a sizable white hangar. Smaller black and blue ramps dot the area, along with a circular white landing target featuring a black center. The surrounding landscape is dry and brown. As the parachutist descends, their shadow becomes visible on the ground, growing in size and clarity, enhancing the sense of decreasing altitude.",
