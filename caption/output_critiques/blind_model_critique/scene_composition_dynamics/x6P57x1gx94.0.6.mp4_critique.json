    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a paved area with a mix of concrete and cobblestone surfaces. The scene includes a series of steps and a low concrete wall with a metal railing, adjacent to a patch of green grass. The environment is open and spacious, with a few pedestrians visible in the background, suggesting a public space like a plaza or park. The weather is clear, allowing for unobstructed visibility of the surroundings. The video shows motion as a person on a skateboard navigates the steps and railing, adding dynamic movement to the otherwise static architectural elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic components of the outdoor urban scene, it lacks the specificity and dynamic language needed to accurately convey the visual experience. It fails to mention the point of view, which is a low-angle, third-person tracking shot that follows the skateboarder, accentuating the action and making the architectural elements appear more imposing. The description of the setting is too general; it could be enhanced by noting the distinct brutalist style of the concrete structures and the visible wear, such as scuff marks and wax residue on the ledge, that defines it as a skate spot. The phrase \"navigates the steps and railing\" significantly downplays the central action; a more precise description would be that the skateboarder grinds down the metal handrail alongside the stairs. Additionally, the caption misses key visual details like the long, sharp shadows cast across the concrete, indicating it is late afternoon, and it omits the presence of a small, white text overlay in the lower-left corner that identifies the skater's name.",
