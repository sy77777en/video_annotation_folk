    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures a sweeping view of a lush, mountainous landscape during the day. The scene is set outdoors, showcasing a dense forest of evergreen trees covering the rolling hills. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible through the white clouds. Mist gently drifts over the mountain peaks, adding a dynamic element to the serene environment. The vibrant green of the trees contrasts with the soft white clouds, creating a picturesque natural setting. The drone's perspective provides a broad, elevated view, emphasizing the vastness and tranquility of the forested mountains.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures many key aspects required by the instructions, but it fails on a few critical negative constraints, particularly regarding subjective language and interpretation.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Cannot be fully verified.** Without access to the video, it's impossible to confirm if the scene truly depicts a \"lush, mountainous landscape,\" \"evergreen trees,\" or \"drifting mist.\" However, assuming the visual content matches the description, the factual elements are presented clearly.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete and successfully includes most of the required information:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identifies the \"drone\" shot.\n*   **Setting:** Clearly states it is \"outdoors\" in a \"mountainous landscape\" with a \"dense forest.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Specifies \"during the day\" with a \"partly cloudy\" sky.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Describes the \"evergreen trees,\" \"rolling hills,\" \"white clouds,\" and \"vibrant green\" color.\n*   **Motion:** Includes the detail that \"Mist gently drifts over the mountain peaks.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has significant issues. It violates several key negative constraints.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery.\n*   It avoids speculation (e.g., \"it appears\").\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1.  **Violation: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives.** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses several:\n    *   **\"lush\"**: This is a subjective assessment of the forest's health and density. A more objective term would be \"dense.\"\n    *   **\"serene\"**: This describes a feeling or mood, which is emotional.\n    *   **\"picturesque\"**: This is a purely subjective judgment of the scene's beauty.\n    *   **\"tranquility\"**: Like \"serene,\" this describes an emotional state.\n\n2.  **Violation: Explaining Emphasis and Interpretation.** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption violates this rule directly and indirectly:\n    *   The phrase \"...adding a dynamic element to the serene environment\" is an interpretation of the mist's effect on the scene, rather than a simple description of its movement.\n    *   The final sentence, \"The drone's perspective provides a broad, elevated view, **emphasizing the vastness and tranquility** of the forested mountains,\" is a direct violation of this rule. It explicitly explains what the shot \"emphasizes.\"\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that adheres strictly to all instructions:\n\nFrom a drone's point of view, the video shows a wide expanse of a mountainous landscape during the day. The outdoor scene consists of a dense forest of green evergreen trees covering rolling hills under a partly cloudy sky with visible patches of blue. Mist drifts over the mountain peaks. The drone provides a broad, elevated perspective over the forested mountains.",
