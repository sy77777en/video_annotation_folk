    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a narrow, paved residential street in a Japanese neighborhood on a sunny day. On the left, a silver minivan is parked in front of a house with a dark tiled roof and reddish-brown siding. Next to it, a white kei truck is parked in a driveway beside a wooden slat fence that borders a property with a prominent green tree. Traditional-style houses with tiled roofs line the street, some featuring solar panels. Further down the road, a light blue house is visible on the right. Power lines and poles run alongside the street, and in the distance, other houses and a red and white communications tower can be seen against a clear blue sky. Shadows are cast on the pavement, indicating the bright sunlight.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the general setting and key elements, it could be improved by refining the description of motion and architectural details, and by including some plausible visual information that was missed. The phrase \"as if through the character’s eyes\" is redundant with \"first-person POV shot\" and could be removed for conciseness. The description of movement as \"moves along\" is vague; the video actually shows a steady walking pace, indicated by a subtle, rhythmic bob of the camera. The caption's specific ordering of the parked vehicles is incorrect; the white kei truck is parked closest to the street, partially obscuring the black car behind it. Furthermore, while \"traditional-style houses\" is mentioned, the video shows a mix of architectural styles, with several modern homes featuring minimalist concrete facades alongside the older ones with tiled roofs. The caption also omits a prominent red public mailbox visible on a concrete pole just past the parking area on the left. Finally, the description fails to note a semi-transparent watermark overlay in the bottom right corner, which displays a social media handle throughout the video.",
