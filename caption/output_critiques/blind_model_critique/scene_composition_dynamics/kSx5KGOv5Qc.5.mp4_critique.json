    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone offers an aerial perspective of the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, under daylight conditions. This outdoor scene reveals a dense concentration of buildings, characterized by their orange terracotta tiled roofs and light-colored stone or stucco walls, entirely encircled by formidable grey stone fortifications. A notable cylindrical stone tower forms part of these defenses. The city is bordered on one side by the deep blue waters of the Adriatic Sea. Green vegetation is visible in areas outside the city walls and within some courtyards. In the lower right, a prominent red structure is situated near the water. A watermark consisting of \"Vectr.org\" and \"COPYRIGHT\" is overlaid in the top left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good static overview of the location, but it misses the dynamic nature of the video and several key visual details. The drone does not hold a fixed position; instead, it performs a slow, sweeping pan from left to right, starting with a wider view of the Adriatic Sea and gradually moving to focus more on the walled city itself. The description of \"daylight\" is vague; the video is clearly set in the late afternoon, characterized by a warm, golden light that makes the orange terracotta roofs glow and casts long, distinct shadows from the fortifications onto the surrounding buildings. The caption also omits the visible activity in the scene: several small white boats and a larger ferry create wakes in the water, and tiny figures of people can be seen walking along the top of the main city wall. The \"prominent red structure\" is clearly identifiable as a red clay tennis court adjacent to a small park area. Finally, the watermark in the top left corner is legible and reads \"@AdriaticAirs.\" Incorporating the drone's movement, the specific lighting conditions, and the signs of life would more accurately reflect the actual video content.",
