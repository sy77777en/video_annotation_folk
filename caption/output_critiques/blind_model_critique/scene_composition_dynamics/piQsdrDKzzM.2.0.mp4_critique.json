    "pre_caption": "The video is set in an indoor parking garage with a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere. The environment features concrete pillars and walls, with a muted color palette dominated by grays and browns. The lighting is low, casting soft shadows and creating a subdued ambiance. The garage is spacious, with visible structural elements like beams and support columns. A car is partially visible, adding to the utilitarian feel of the setting. The scene remains consistent in its industrial tone, with no significant changes in lighting or environment, maintaining a steady, observational perspective throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few areas for improvement regarding adherence to the specific instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene's core elements. It correctly identifies the setting as an \"indoor parking garage,\" the \"concrete pillars and walls,\" the \"muted color palette dominated by grays and browns,\" and the \"low\" lighting that \"casts soft shadows.\"\n*   The mention of a \"partially visible\" car is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully describes the setting, environment, and notable visual elements as requested.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The description of the point of view and motion is incomplete. The caption states it maintains a \"steady, observational perspective,\" which is true, but it fails to mention the distinct, slow camera movement (a pan or dolly shot) that occurs throughout the video. This motion is a key dynamic element of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Positive:** The caption correctly follows many rules. It is a single, concise paragraph, avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" focuses on the setting, and correctly omits details about time of day and weather.\n*   **Violation 1 (Inference):** The instruction states, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The phrase \"adding to the utilitarian feel of the setting\" is an inference about the purpose and character of the environment, which violates this rule.\n*   **Violation 2 (Subjectivity):** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The term \"subdued ambiance\" is slightly subjective. While it's a reasonable interpretation, a more objective description would stick to the physical facts, such as \"the low lighting creates areas of deep shadow.\"\n*   **Violation 3 (Vague POV/Motion):** The instruction asks to describe motion. The caption misses the opportunity to describe the slow, continuous camera pan, which is a defining characteristic of the video. \"Steady, observational perspective\" is too general and doesn't capture this movement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a strong start, accurately capturing the static elements of the scene. However, it is not a \"good\" caption according to the strict rules provided because it violates the instructions by inferring the setting's \"feel,\" using subjective language, and failing to describe the camera's distinct motion. To be fully compliant, it should remove the inferential and subjective phrases and add a clear description of the camera movement.",
