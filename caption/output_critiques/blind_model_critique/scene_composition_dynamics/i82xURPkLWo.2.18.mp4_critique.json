    "pre_caption": "The scene is set inside a rustic, wood-paneled room during the daytime. In the foreground, a man in a light blue shirt sits on a brown leather couch. The background features a workshop area with a large, mint-green tool cabinet mounted on the wall, its doors open to reveal a neat arrangement of tools. A wooden workbench with various items sits below the cabinet. To the right, a small kitchenette with a white sink is visible, and a framed picture of a lighthouse hangs on the wooden wall. Another man in a pink t-shirt stands in a doorway in the background, holding a red can. The room is illuminated by soft, natural light from several windows.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and setting, but it misses the crucial point of view and some key dynamic and atmospheric details. The video is filmed from a static, eye-level perspective, giving the viewer a stable, observational position. The description of \"various items\" on the workbench is too vague; the video clearly shows a half-finished wooden model boat and several carving tools, which better defines the space as a hobbyist's workshop. While the caption notes the man walking, it omits that the man on the couch turns his head toward the doorway just before the other man enters, suggesting an interaction is about to begin. Furthermore, the action doesn't end with the man entering the middleground; he proceeds to place the red can and green glass bottle on a small wooden end table next to the couch. The \"soft, natural light\" is more specifically characterized by distinct beams of sunlight filtering through the windows from the left, illuminating dust motes in the air and creating strong highlights on the wooden floor. Lastly, the caption fails to mention a semi-transparent watermark for \"Maker's Hideout\" in the bottom-right corner of the screen.",
