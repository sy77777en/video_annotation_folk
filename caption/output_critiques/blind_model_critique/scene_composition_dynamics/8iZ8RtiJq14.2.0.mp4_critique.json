Red strings are pinned to the board, radiating from a central red pin, creating a web-like pattern. Two pieces of paper are attached to the board: one is white with \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in bold letters, and the other is red with \"JEROME JACOBSON\" inscribed.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is good but contains several specific violations of the instructions. While it is accurate and descriptive, it fails on key points related to avoiding inference, subjective language, and explaining emphasis.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is very accurate in its description of the physical objects. It correctly identifies the corkboard, its texture, the red strings, the pins, the two pieces of paper, and the text written on them (\"UNCLE JERRY,\" \"JEROME JACOBSON\"). The description of the layout as a \"web-like pattern\" is also factually accurate.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Good but Incomplete:** The caption successfully describes the core elements. However, it is missing key information required by the instructions:\n    *   **Point of View (POV):** The caption does not specify the POV (e.g., static shot, handheld, straight-on). This is a mandatory element according to the instructions.\n    *   **Motion:** It does not mention whether the scene is static or if there is any camera movement (like a slow zoom or pan), which is a required detail if present. Assuming the video is a still shot, it should be described as static.\n\n**3. Adherence to the Instruction:**\n*   **Needs Improvement:** This is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n    *   **Violation (Inference):** The phrase \"**suggesting a network or connection**\" violates the rule: \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" While the strings do form a network, the word \"suggesting\" interprets the meaning for the viewer rather than simply describing the physical state.\n    *   **Violation (Explaining Emphasis):** The word \"**highlighting**\" in \"highlighting the board's details\" directly violates the rule: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Violation (Subjective Adjective):** The word \"**vibrant**\" in \"vibrant color of the strings\" violates the rule: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The color should be described factually as \"red.\"\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that strictly adheres to all the provided instructions:\n\nFrom a static, straight-on point of view, the indoor scene features a corkboard with a textured, mottled surface. Red strings are pinned across the board, radiating from a central red pin to form a web-like pattern. Two pieces of paper are attached to the board; one is a white paper with the words \"UNCLE JERRY\" in bold letters, and the other is a red paper with \"JEROME JACOBSON\" inscribed on it. The strings connect the central pin to these papers. The scene is evenly lit, and there are no visible overlays.",
