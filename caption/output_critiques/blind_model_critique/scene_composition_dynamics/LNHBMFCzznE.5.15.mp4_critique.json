    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dark auditorium, viewed from the perspective of the audience looking toward a raised stage. A woman in a black dress stands on a bright red rectangular carpet at the center of the stage. The background features a white, vertically slatted wall structure illuminated in blue, with the number \"1733\" visible on its side. To the right of this wall is a decorative stack of circular objects, also lit in blue, creating a honeycomb-like pattern.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **very good** and adheres closely to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It precisely identifies key elements, their properties, and their placement within the scene. Details like the \"bright red rectangular carpet,\" the \"white, vertically slatted wall structure illuminated in blue,\" the number \"1733,\" and the \"honeycomb-like pattern\" are specific and fact-based, which is excellent.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Point of View:** The caption correctly identifies the POV as \"from the perspective of the audience looking toward a raised stage.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It clearly establishes the setting as a \"dark auditorium\" (indoors) and describes the key architectural and prop elements like the \"raised stage,\" \"slatted wall structure,\" and \"white couch.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It successfully describes the color, shape, and distinguishing features of the carpet, wall, and decorative objects.\n*   **Subjects:** The subject (\"a woman in a black dress\") is included with appropriate context and placement (\"stands on a bright red rectangular carpet at the center of the stage\") without excessive detail, correctly prioritizing the scenery.\n*   **Potential Omission:** The caption describes a static scene (\"A woman... stands\"). If there is any motion in the video (e.g., the woman speaking or moving, camera movement), the caption is incomplete as it fails to mention it, which is a requirement of the instructions. If the video is a still shot, then the caption is complete.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is written in simple, natural English and forms a single, coherent paragraph. It is easy to understand and logically organized.\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"impressive\") and speculative language (\"appears to be,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Focus:** The focus remains on the setting and scenery, with the subject described only in relation to her place within that scene. It does not infer the purpose of the event or what the scene emphasizes.\n*   **Formatting:** It correctly returns only the one-paragraph description without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of all the core requirements, from identifying the point of view and setting to describing visual elements with objective precision. Its only potential flaw is the lack of motion description, which is entirely dependent on whether the video itself contains any movement. Assuming the video is a static shot, the caption is perfect.",
