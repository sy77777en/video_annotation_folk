    "pre_caption": "In a stark, black-and-white scene, a high-angle view looks down into a dark urban courtyard at night. The courtyard is enclosed by the dark facades of multi-story buildings, some of whose windows are brightly lit from within. In the center of the open, dark ground, two featureless, humanoid figures stand side-by-side, glowing with a soft white light that illuminates the area immediately around them. White subtitles are visible at the bottom of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good and closely follows the instructions. It effectively creates a clear and objective picture of the scene.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a coherent and plausible visual scene. It correctly identifies the point of view, the black-and-white style, the setting, the time of day, and the key visual elements like the glowing figures and lit windows. The description of the subtitles is also accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive, successfully including all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"high-angle view.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It clearly establishes the setting as a \"dark urban courtyard at night\" enclosed by \"multi-story buildings.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** \"at night\" is explicitly stated.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It describes the \"black-and-white scene,\" the \"brightly lit\" windows, and the \"two featureless, humanoid figures, glowing with a soft white light.\"\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the \"White subtitles\" and their placement \"at the bottom of the scene.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates excellent adherence to the specific rules provided:\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet packed with essential details.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** It prioritizes the courtyard, buildings, and overall atmosphere over the subjects, as requested.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids speculation, inference, and emotional language for the most part. Terms like \"featureless\" and \"humanoid\" are descriptive and objective.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" \"appears,\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Simple English:** The language is clear, natural, and easy to understand.\n\n**Minor Area for Improvement:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The word **\"stark\"** is a subjective term that describes a feeling or impression of the scene rather than a purely visual quality. While effective, it technically violates this rule. A more neutral alternative could be to simply begin with \"In a black-and-white scene...\" as the contrast is already implied by the description that follows. The word \"soft\" to describe the light is borderline but generally acceptable as a physical descriptor of light diffusion.",
