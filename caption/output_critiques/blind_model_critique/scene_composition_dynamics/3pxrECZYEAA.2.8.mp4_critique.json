    "pre_caption": "This animated scene is set in a room with a vibrant, warm color palette dominated by reds and oranges. The shot begins as a close-up on a face and pulls back to reveal the setting, which includes a green and white dartboard mounted on a wall. To the right, curly yellow lines, possibly part of a sign or decoration, are visible. The central figure has red skin, blond hair, and eyes that are bright cyan with magenta outlines and concentric circles. The person is shown bringing a piece of food to their mouth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the animated nature of the scene, the warm color palette, and the primary camera motion of pulling back from a close-up. However, it violates the instruction to focus on setting over subject by dedicating excessive detail to the central figure's facial features, such as their red skin and the specific colors and patterns of their eyes. The description of the environment is too vague. For instance, \"a room\" could be more specific by describing the walls, such as dark wood paneling, which would better establish the setting. The \"list\" on the wall is mentioned without describing its appearance, such as a menu written in white chalk on a blackboard. Similarly, describing the \"curly yellow lines\" as a glowing neon sign would be more precise. The \"two decorative items\" are a significant omission, as they lack any description of their color, material, or form; they could be, for example, two brown ceramic steins with metallic lids sitting on a wooden counter. The caption also misses potential environmental motion that would be visible in a video, such as the \"Beer\" sign flickering intermittently or faint steam rising from the white cup as it is lifted. Finally, the use of the subjective adjective \"vibrant\" could be replaced with a more objective description of the scene's lighting.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The animated scene unfolds in a cozy room characterized by dark wood paneling, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The shot begins with a close-up on a face and gradually pulls back to reveal the setting. On the wall, a green and white dartboard is prominently displayed. To the right, a glowing neon sign with curly yellow lines adds a touch of brightness. A blackboard menu, written in white chalk, lists various items. Two brown ceramic steins with metallic lids sit on a wooden counter, adding to the room's rustic charm. The environment is dynamic, with a \"Beer\" sign flickering intermittently and faint steam rising from a white cup as it is lifted. The lighting is soft and ambient, enhancing the room's warm color palette dominated by reds and oranges.",
