    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a lush meadow filled with vibrant yellow flowers. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the landscape. The meadow stretches into the distance, creating a sense of vastness and tranquility. The flowers sway gently, suggesting a light breeze. The focus on the flowers highlights their delicate beauty against the rich green grass, emphasizing the natural and peaceful environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it correctly describes the basic scenery, it violates the core requirements for tone, objectivity, and content.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is not good:\n\n**1. Violation of Negative Constraints (What to Avoid):**\n\n*   **Use of Emotional and Subjective Language:** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses several: \"serene,\" \"lush,\" \"vibrant,\" \"tranquility,\" \"delicate beauty,\" and \"peaceful.\" These words describe feelings and interpretations rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Explaining Emphasis and Highlights:** The instructions clearly state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption directly violates this with the sentences: \"The focus on the flowers **highlights** their delicate beauty...\" and \"...**emphasizing** the natural and peaceful environment.\" It also explains the effect on the viewer by stating the meadow is \"...creating a sense of vastness and tranquility.\"\n*   **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instruction is to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" The caption states the flowers' movement is \"...suggesting a light breeze.\" It should simply describe the observable motion (\"The flowers sway gently\") without inferring the cause.\n\n**2. Incompleteness (Missing Information):**\n\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions require specifying the point of view (e.g., first-person, drone shot, static tripod shot). The caption omits this crucial detail, which influences how the scene is perceived.\n*   **Overlays:** The caption does not mention whether any overlay elements like text, watermarks, or icons are present. The instructions require describing these if they exist.\n\n**3. Accuracy and Adherence to Positive Instructions:**\n\n*   **What it does well:** The caption correctly identifies the setting as an outdoor meadow, notes the time of day, and describes the color of the flowers and grass. It also correctly describes motion (\"flowers sway gently\") and is formatted as a single paragraph.\n*   **Where it falls short:** The primary failure is its interpretive and subjective tone. The goal of the instructions is to create a purely descriptive, factual account of the visual information, almost like a database entry. This caption reads more like a marketing or artistic description, focusing on the mood and feeling of the scene, which is the opposite of what was requested.",
