    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres to the majority of the instructions. It successfully creates a clear, objective, and detailed mental image of the scene. However, it has one specific violation of the rules that prevents it from being perfect.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption is highly accurate. It uses precise, descriptive language (e.g., \"grid of small, light-green square tiles,\" \"dark, murky water,\" \"gently rippling\") that effectively conveys the visual information of the scene without exaggeration.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is very complete and successfully incorporates most of the required elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Point of View:** Correctly identifies the \"first-person POV\" and its position \"from the surface of... water.\"\n    *   **Setting:** Clearly establishes an \"indoors\" setting (\"dimly lit room\").\n    *   **Environment:** Describes the key features of the environment (tiled walls, water, a large opening).\n    *   **Lighting:** Specifies the lighting conditions (\"dimly lit\").\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** Provides excellent detail on the color, shape, and texture of the tiles and the appearance of the water.\n    *   **Motion:** Includes the \"gently rippling water,\" fulfilling the requirement to describe movement.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption follows most of the rules exceptionally well, but fails on one key point.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"scary,\" \"eerie\").\n*   It avoids referring to frames or using terms like \"image.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than subjects.\n*   It does not infer the purpose or role of the setting.\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   The caption contains the phrase **\"a large, dark, circular opening or pipe.\"** This directly violates the instruction: **\"Avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"** The instruction requires definitive descriptions. The caption should commit to describing it as either an \"opening\" or a \"pipe\" based on the visual evidence, rather than presenting both options.\n\n**How to Improve:**\n\nTo be fully compliant, the caption should be revised to remove the ambiguity.\n\n*   **Correction:** Instead of \"opening or pipe,\" it should be either \"a large, dark, circular opening\" or \"a large, dark, circular pipe,\" depending on which is more visually accurate.\n\n**Corrected Example (assuming it's a pipe):**\n\nA first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is taken from the surface of dark, murky water inside a dimly lit room. The walls are covered in a grid of small, light-green square tiles. Directly ahead, a large, dark, circular pipe emerges from the back wall, partially submerged in the gently rippling water.",
