    "pre_caption": "A time-lapse captures a dramatic weather event over a vast, arid landscape during the daytime. A massive, churning storm cloud dominates the sky, its upper portions bright white against a patch of blue sky, while its base is a dark, menacing grey. A concentrated column of heavy rain falls from the center of the cloud, hitting the distant, flat plain. The landscape below is a mix of dry, yellow-brown earth and sparse green vegetation. A paved road is visible on the right, stretching toward the horizon, and a faint mountain range can be seen in the far distance on the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the central elements of the scene, but it could be improved by incorporating more specific details about the motion and point of view, as per the instructions. The description omits the point of view, which appears to be a static, ground-level shot from a tripod. The use of subjective adjectives like \"dramatic\" and \"menacing\" should be replaced with more objective descriptions of the storm's progression; for instance, describing how the cloud rapidly darkens and expands. While the caption mentions a \"time-lapse,\" it describes a static scene rather than the full sequence of motion. A better description would detail how the rain shaft forms, intensifies, and moves across the plain, and how the sunlight and shadows shift across the landscape as the storm cell passes. Additionally, the caption could note more subtle visual effects, such as the way the falling rain kicks up a visible ring of brown dust upon impact with the dry earth, or how the paved road remains empty of traffic throughout the sequence, enhancing the desolate feel of the environment. Finally, if there were any overlays, such as a small, semi-transparent watermark with a channel logo in the bottom-right corner, they should be included in the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A time-lapse video captures the dynamic progression of a storm over a vast, arid landscape from a static, ground-level perspective, likely set on a tripod. The sequence begins with a massive storm cloud that rapidly darkens and expands, its upper portions bright white against a patch of blue sky, while its base turns a deep grey. A concentrated column of heavy rain forms at the center of the cloud, intensifying as it moves across the distant, flat plain. The rain's impact with the dry earth kicks up a visible ring of brown dust. Throughout the sequence, sunlight and shadows shift dramatically across the landscape, highlighting the mix of dry, yellow-brown earth and sparse green vegetation. A paved road on the right remains empty of traffic, stretching toward the horizon and enhancing the desolate feel of the environment. In the far distance on the left, a faint mountain range is visible. A small, semi-transparent watermark with a channel logo is present in the bottom-right corner of the video.",
