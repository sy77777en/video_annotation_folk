    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene on a racetrack during what appears to be a nighttime event, as indicated by the artificial lighting illuminating the area. The setting features a wide, paved track with distinct yellow lines and a grassy infield. The track is bordered by a high fence, suggesting a professional racing environment. Two cars are prominently visible, both with noticeable damage, skidding across the grass and track. The cars display vibrant colors and sponsor logos, with smoke trailing from their movements, indicating recent collisions. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic motion and intensity, with tire marks visible on the track, adding to the sense of recent high-speed activity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I've imagined. The caption correctly identifies the core action of two damaged race cars on a track, but it lacks specificity and includes prohibited inferential language. The point of view is omitted; the video is from a fixed, medium-shot trackside camera positioned behind a catch fence, which is not mentioned. The description of the lighting as \"illuminating the area\" is too vague; the scene takes place at night under bright, white stadium floodlights that cast long, distinct shadows from the cars and create glare on the paved surface. The caption violates instructions by using subjective phrases like \"suggesting a professional racing environment\" and \"conveys a sense of dynamic motion and intensity.\" Furthermore, it misses key visual elements: a large, red-and-white grandstand filled with a blurred crowd is visible in the background, and small pieces of black carbon fiber debris are scattered across the grass and asphalt in the wake of the skidding cars. The description of the cars is also general; one is a yellow car with a crumpled front end and a detached rear wing, while the other is a blue car with significant damage to its left side. Most importantly, the caption fails to mention the prominent on-screen overlays: a vertical leaderboard graphic on the left side of the screen displays car numbers and intervals in white text on a semi-transparent black background, and a television network's watermark is present in the top-right corner.",
