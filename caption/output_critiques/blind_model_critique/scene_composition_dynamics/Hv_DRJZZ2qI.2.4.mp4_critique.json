    "pre_caption": "In an arid, rocky canyon under a bright, overcast sky, a series of man-made wooden structures are built into a reddish-brown hillside. On the left, a tall wooden platform serves as a starting point, from which a cyclist on a bicycle launches into the air. Below this platform, a large, curved wooden ramp supported by an intricate timber framework spans a gap in the terrain. The landscape is characterized by steep, dirt-covered slopes dotted with sparse green vegetation and layered rock formations in the distance. A white, circular object is affixed to the side of the starting platform's support structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the setting and the primary structures, but it fails to capture the dynamic nature of the video, reading more like a description of a single photograph. The video likely shows the entire action sequence, not just the launch; the caption should describe the cyclist's full trajectory through the air and the subsequent landing on the curved wooden ramp, including the motion of the bike and the dust kicked up upon impact. The point of view is a critical missing element; the video is likely a dynamic drone shot that tracks the cyclist's movement, providing a sweeping perspective of the jump and the canyon, which is not conveyed. Furthermore, the description of the \"white, circular object\" is too vague; in the video, it is clearly a large, white brand logo, which is a significant visual detail. The caption also omits a hard cut to a low-angle shot from beside the landing ramp, which shows the impact and the cyclist speeding away. Finally, the video contains a semi-transparent watermark for an energy drink brand in the bottom-right corner, an overlay element that is entirely absent from the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an arid, rocky canyon under a bright, overcast sky, a series of man-made wooden structures are built into a reddish-brown hillside. A cyclist on a bicycle launches from a tall wooden platform on the left, soaring through the air with grace and precision. The dynamic drone shot captures the cyclist's full trajectory, sweeping across the canyon to reveal the expansive landscape of steep, dirt-covered slopes dotted with sparse green vegetation and layered rock formations in the distance. As the cyclist lands on the large, curved wooden ramp, dust billows up, adding to the drama of the scene. The camera then cuts to a low-angle shot beside the landing ramp, capturing the impact and the cyclist speeding away. A large, white brand logo is prominently displayed on the side of the starting platform's support structure, while a semi-transparent watermark for an energy drink brand is visible in the bottom-right corner throughout the video.",
