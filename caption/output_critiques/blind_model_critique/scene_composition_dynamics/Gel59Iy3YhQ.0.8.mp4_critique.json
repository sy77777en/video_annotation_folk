    "pre_caption": "In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the scene is set in an outdoor, snowy landscape rendered in a pixel art style. The ground is a light blue expanse of snow, forming stepped platforms and bordered by dark, rocky cliffs. In the upper corner, a single pine tree is covered in snow. The view scrolls upward and to the right, revealing more of the snowy terrain and a character standing on a cliff edge in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few specific areas where it fails to fully adhere to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe description of the scene's visual elements—a pixel art style, a snowy landscape with light blue snow, stepped platforms, dark cliffs, and a snow-covered pine tree—is accurate and precise. The description of the motion (\"scrolls upward and to the right\") is also clear.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption successfully includes the setting, environment, style, and motion as requested. However, it is potentially incomplete in one key area:\n*   **Overlays:** The caption identifies the video as a \"gaming video\" but does not mention any overlay elements like a Heads-Up Display (HUD), score, health bar, or other on-screen graphics. The instructions explicitly require describing such overlays if they are present. If the video contains any, their omission makes the caption incomplete.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction:\nThe caption adheres well to most instructions, but it violates a critical one.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n*   It avoids subjective language, speculation about the game's purpose, and terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery over the subject.\n*   It describes colors, shapes, and natural features as instructed.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere:**\n*   **Ambiguous Point of View:** The instruction states to avoid speculative statements and ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" The phrase \"top-down or oblique top-down view\" directly violates this rule. The caption should definitively state the point of view (e.g., \"an oblique top-down view\").",

The view scrolls upward and to the right, revealing more of the snowy terrain and a character standing on a cliff edge in the distance.
