    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor urban street scene, likely in a historic district. The setting features a row of buildings with distinct architectural elements, such as wrought iron balconies adorned with hanging plants. The buildings are characterized by their brick facades and large, white-framed windows and doors. A narrow sidewalk runs alongside the street, where a person is seen walking. The street itself is wet, suggesting recent rain, and a vehicle with a visible paw print decal is parked nearby. The time of day appears to be overcast, contributing to a muted color palette dominated by earthy tones and the greenery of the plants. The scene conveys a sense of quiet urban life, with minimal movement and a focus on the architectural details.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it violates several key negative constraints outlined in the instructions. While it accurately captures some visual elements, it fails in its adherence to the required tone and format.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its failures:\n\n1.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions explicitly state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The caption violates this rule multiple times:\n    *   \"...**likely** in a historic district.\"\n    *   \"...**suggesting** recent rain.\"\n    *   \"...**appears** to be overcast.\"\n    *   \"...**contributing to** a muted color palette.\" (This infers a cause-and-effect relationship).\n\n2.  **Inclusion of Subjective Interpretation:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The final sentence directly violates this.\n    *   \"The scene **conveys a sense of quiet urban life**...\" (This is an interpretation of the mood).\n    *   \"...with a **focus on the architectural details**.\" (This explains what the scene highlights).\n\n3.  **Missing Required Information:** The instructions ask to \"indicate the **point of view**\" if relevant. A street-level scene has a clear point of view (e.g., eye-level, handheld, static shot) that influences the viewer's perception, but the caption omits this detail entirely.\n\n4.  **Minor Word Choice Issues:** While minor, words like \"distinct\" can be seen as slightly subjective. The goal is to describe, not qualify.\n\n### Corrected Example Adhering to Instructions:\n\nFrom an eye-level perspective, the video shows an outdoor urban street lined with buildings that have brick facades, large white-framed windows, and wrought iron balconies with hanging plants. The street and the narrow sidewalk are wet under overcast lighting. A person walks on the sidewalk near a parked vehicle that has a paw print decal. The scene has a muted color palette of earthy tones and green, with minimal movement.",
