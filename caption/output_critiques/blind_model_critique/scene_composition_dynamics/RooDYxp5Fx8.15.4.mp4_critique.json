    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moving along a city sidewalk bordered by a black metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The setting is outdoors at a street intersection, with several vehicles, including white and red cars, waiting at a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones. Lush green trees line the background, partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof, while a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds suggests daytime and fair weather. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the sidewalk, and the overall environment is clean and orderly, with no overlays or digital elements present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres to most of the rules. However, there are a few minor areas where it could be improved for perfect compliance.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It constructs a coherent and believable scene by combining specific, objective details (black metal railing, yellow tactile paving, orange traffic cones, metal-backed sign with bolts). The description of the environment, from the sidewalk to the background elements, creates a clear and vivid mental picture that is internally consistent.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and successfully incorporates nearly all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"first-person POV.\"\n*   **Setting:** Clearly stated as \"outdoors at a street intersection.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Included with \"daytime and fair weather\" inferred from the \"clear blue sky with scattered white clouds.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Excellent detail on the railing, tactile paving, cars, cones, trees, and signs, including their color, material, and features.\n*   **Motion:** The movement \"along a city sidewalk\" is noted.\n*   **Overlays:** The absence of overlays is correctly mentioned.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres well to the instructions, but there are a few minor violations:\n\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   \"**Lush** green trees\": \"Lush\" is a subjective quality judgment. A more objective description would be simply \"green trees.\"\n    *   \"...environment is **clean and orderly**\": This is an interpretation of the scene's condition. A more objective statement would describe the absence of specific things, like litter or debris, if that is the case.\n\n*   **Speculative Language:** The instruction is to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   \"...**suggests** daytime and fair weather\": The word \"suggests\" is speculative. The instruction calls for direct, declarative statements. It would be better to state it as a fact based on the visual evidence: \"The scene is set during the daytime under a clear blue sky...\"\n\n*   **Introductory/Concluding Phrases:** The instruction is to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n    *   \"**The video presents**...\": This is an introductory phrase that talks *about* the video rather than simply describing the scene within it.\n    *   \"...**present in the video**\": This is a concluding meta-commentary. The description should feel immersive, not like an analysis of a media file.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is very strong and captures the scene with impressive detail and objectivity. The minor issues identified are subtle and relate to the strictest interpretation of the rules. By eliminating the few subjective, speculative, and introductory words, the caption can be perfected.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption Example (Adhering to all instructions)\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, the perspective moves along a city sidewalk bordered by a black metal railing with vertical bars and a yellow tactile paving strip set into gray tiles. The outdoor scene is set at a street intersection during the daytime under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. Green trees line the background, partially obscuring a building with a sloped roof. At a crosswalk marked by orange traffic cones, several vehicles, including white and red cars, are stopped. Street signs, utility poles, and a large metal-backed sign with visible bolts and a reflective surface are positioned near the sidewalk. The scene contains no overlays.",
