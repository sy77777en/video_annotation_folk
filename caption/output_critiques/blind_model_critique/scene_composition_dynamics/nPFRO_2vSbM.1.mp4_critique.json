    "pre_caption": "The scene is set outdoors in a wide, green valley during the daytime, with large, snow-capped mountains visible in the background under a bright sky. In the foreground, a light-colored wooden lattice wall, characteristic of a yurt, is being assembled. The crisscrossing wooden poles are secured with various ties, including natural-fiber ropes, bright pink cords, and a decorative woven band with a red and green geometric pattern that runs horizontally. Through the openings in the lattice, people can be seen working on the structure, and in the distance, a horse grazes in the expansive meadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key elements of the scene, but it misses the dynamic motion and specific visual details present in the video. It fails to mention the point of view, which combines stable, ground-level shots with sweeping drone footage that emphasizes the vastness of the valley. The description of the assembly is static, whereas the video features a time-lapse sequence showing the circular lattice wall being expanded and the roof poles being methodically slotted into the central wooden crown. While the caption mentions \"people,\" it omits that they are dressed in a mix of modern outdoor gear and traditional embroidered vests, adding cultural context. Furthermore, large rolls of thick, grey felt, the yurt's outer covering, are visible on the grass nearby, waiting to be installed, but are not included in the description. The \"bright sky\" is more specifically a deep blue with thin, fast-moving clouds that suggest a windy day, a detail that complements the motion of the people working and the horse occasionally lifting its head. Including these details about the camera work, the time-lapse progression, the subjects' attire, and the additional materials would provide a more complete and vivid account of the video.",
