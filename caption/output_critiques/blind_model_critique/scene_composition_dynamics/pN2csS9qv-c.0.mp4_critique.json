    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor gymnastics arena with a high ceiling and bright artificial lighting. The setting features a large gymnastics floor surrounded by equipment, including parallel bars and mats. The environment is bustling with activity, as gymnasts and coaches move around the equipment. Spectators are seated in bleachers along the sides, watching the events unfold. The arena is decorated with banners and signage, displaying team names and logos. The floor is marked with blue and white colors, and the equipment is primarily blue with metallic elements. The scene is lively, with people engaged in various activities related to the gymnastics event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption.\n\n**Evaluation of the Caption**\n\nThe caption is generally good but has a few key areas where it fails to meet the specific requirements of the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Cannot Be Assessed:** Without the video, it is impossible to determine if the description is accurate. For example, I cannot verify the presence of parallel bars, the blue and white colors, the banners, or the spectators. The feedback below is based solely on how the caption adheres to the structural and stylistic rules of the instructions.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Partially Complete:** The caption successfully describes the setting (indoor gymnastics arena), environment (equipment, spectators), and notable visual elements (colors, materials, markings).\n*   **Missing Information:** The caption fails to mention the **point of view** (e.g., static wide shot, handheld, panning shot). The instructions explicitly ask for this if relevant, and it is a crucial element for describing how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Focus on Setting:** The caption correctly prioritizes the setting and scenery over detailed descriptions of the subjects (gymnasts, coaches).\n    *   **No Speculation:** It avoids speculative language like \"it seems\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without markdown or introductory text, as requested.\n    *   **Detail:** It includes specific details about colors (\"blue and white\"), materials (\"metallic elements\"), and key features (\"bleachers,\" \"banners\").\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Violations of Instructions):**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using the words **\"bustling\"** and **\"lively.\"** These words describe a feeling or atmosphere rather than providing a neutral, objective observation. More neutral alternatives would be \"active\" or \"populated.\"\n    *   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video captures...\" While not a major error, the best practice according to the instructions is to describe the scene directly (e.g., \"An indoor gymnastics arena is shown...\") to avoid meta-commentary about the video itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a solid attempt that follows many of the core instructions, particularly regarding focus and detail. However, it is not a \"good\" caption by the strict standards provided because it **misses the required point of view** and **includes subjective adjectives (\"bustling,\" \"lively\")**, which were explicitly forbidden. To be fully compliant, it would need to add the POV and replace the subjective words with neutral descriptors.",
