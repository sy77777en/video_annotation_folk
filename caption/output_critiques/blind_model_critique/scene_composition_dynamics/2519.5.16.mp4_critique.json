    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with a subdued atmosphere, likely captured in a dimly lit room. The environment features muted colors, with soft shadows and a focus on a single subject. The subject is positioned centrally, with a neutral expression, and the lighting highlights subtle textures on their face. The background is blurred, emphasizing the subject while maintaining a sense of depth. The overall scene conveys a quiet, introspective mood, with minimal movement or change throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several key positive and negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### 1. Adherence to Negative Constraints (What it did wrong)\n\nThe caption violates several explicit \"do not\" rules from the instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption uses the phrase **\"likely captured in a dimly lit room.\"** The word \"likely\" is speculative and forbidden by the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption describes a **\"subdued atmosphere\"** and a **\"quiet, introspective mood.\"** These are subjective interpretations of the scene's feeling, directly violating the rule to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Do Not Explain What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** The caption states that the blurred background is **\"emphasizing the subject\"** and **\"maintaining a sense of depth.\"** This is an analytical explanation of a cinematic technique, which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The instruction requires describing *what* is visible (a blurred background), not *why* it is that way.\n*   **Focus on Setting and Scenery:** The caption dedicates significant attention to the subject (\"positioned centrally,\" \"neutral expression,\" \"textures on their face\"). While mentioning the subject is allowed, the instructions state to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions,\" which this caption does not prioritize.\n\n### 2. Completeness (What it missed)\n\nThe caption is missing several required pieces of information:\n\n*   **Point of View:** The POV is a mandatory element (e.g., static shot, handheld, first-person) but is not mentioned at all.\n*   **Time of Day:** The time of day is not specified. \"Dimly lit\" could be a dark room during the day or a room at night.\n*   **Specific Setting Details:** For an indoor scene, the instructions require describing key furniture or props (\"a wooden desk cluttered with books\"). The caption only offers a generic \"dimly lit room\" with a \"blurred\" background, providing no concrete details about the environment itself.\n*   **Color and Material:** While it mentions \"muted colors,\" it fails to describe the color, material, or shape of any specific object in the scene, as required.\n\n### 3. Accuracy and Style\n\n*   The caption begins with **\"The video presents...\"** which is a meta-description of the media itself rather than a direct description of the scene. A better approach is to start describing the scene directly (e.g., \"From a static point of view, an indoor scene...\").\n*   The description is too generic to be informative. An effective caption would allow someone to visualize a specific scene, whereas this one could describe thousands of different videos.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption (Following the Instructions)\n\nTo illustrate the difference, here is a hypothetical caption for a similar scene that correctly follows all the rules:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, an indoor scene is set in a room at night. A person is positioned in the center of the view, sitting at a dark brown wooden desk upon which rests a single, unlit brass lamp. The primary light source is off-camera, casting soft shadows across the plain, beige wall in the background, which is out of focus. There is no discernible movement throughout the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a static, eye-level point of view, an indoor scene unfolds in a room at night. A person sits centrally at a dark brown wooden desk, which holds a single, unlit brass lamp. The primary light source, located off-camera, casts soft shadows on the plain, beige wall in the blurred background. The scene remains still, with no noticeable movement.",
