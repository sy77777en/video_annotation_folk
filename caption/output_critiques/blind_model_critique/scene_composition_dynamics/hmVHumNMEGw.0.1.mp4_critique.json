    "pre_caption": "An outdoor scene unfolds during the day in a modern urban residential area. In the background, contemporary apartment buildings with glass-paneled facades stand behind a black metal fence and manicured green hedges. The foreground consists of a light-colored paved walkway with a gated entrance flanked by two concrete pillars. A sign is affixed to each pillar. The scene is brightly illuminated by the sun, which creates a prominent lens flare and casts long, distinct shadows across the pavement. A person in a black-and-white checkered sweater and blue jeans dances in front of the gate as the camera moves around them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by accurately describing the modern residential setting, the subject's attire, and the bright, sunny lighting conditions. However, it could be improved by adding more specific details about the motion and visual elements. The description of the camera movement as just \"moves around them\" is vague; specifying that it's a smooth, continuous orbital pan would better capture the dynamic feel of the shot. The \"signs affixed\" to the pillars could be described more concretely, for instance, as white rectangular signs bearing the black-lettered name of the apartment complex. The \"light-colored paved walkway\" could be detailed as being constructed from interlocking grey paving stones. Furthermore, the caption omits a key visual element common in such videos: a semi-transparent username watermark is visible in the bottom-right corner throughout the shot. While the subject's action is noted as \"dances,\" clarifying this as \"performs a choreographed routine\" would be more precise without being overly detailed about the subject themselves. Finally, the scene feels slightly isolated; adding that a quiet street with a few parked cars is visible behind the fence would provide better environmental context.",
