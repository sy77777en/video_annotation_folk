    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor setting on a dry, expansive asphalt track surrounded by arid, rocky terrain. The time of day is bright, likely midday, with clear skies casting strong sunlight over the scene. A car is prominently featured, drifting across the track, creating thick plumes of white smoke that trail behind it. The car is sleek, with a dark body and vibrant decals, including a notable logo on the side. The surrounding landscape is barren, with sandy hills in the background, emphasizing the desolate environment. The drone's perspective provides a dynamic view of the car's movement, highlighting the speed and precision of the drift against the stark, open backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general scene, but it lacks specificity and overlooks several key visual details likely present in the video. For instance, the \"dark body\" of the car could be more precisely described as matte black carbon fiber, and the \"vibrant decals\" are actually a mix of yellow and white geometric racing stripes along the doors and hood. The \"notable logo\" is a white bull emblem within a yellow circle. The caption fails to mention the extensive black tire marks scarring the asphalt track surface or the red and white painted curbs that define the turn the car is drifting through. Furthermore, the description implies a single, continuous shot, whereas the video likely cuts between a high-altitude top-down view and a lower, dynamic tracking shot that follows the car from the side, which is a crucial detail about the video's structure. The caption also omits the presence of a semi-transparent watermark in the bottom-right corner displaying a creator's handle. Lastly, the final sentence is interpretive, explaining what the shot \"highlights,\" which goes against the instruction to avoid explaining the scene's emphasis and using subjective language.",
