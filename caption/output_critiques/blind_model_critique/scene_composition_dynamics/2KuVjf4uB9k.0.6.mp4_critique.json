    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor setting on a dry, expansive asphalt track surrounded by arid, rocky terrain. The time of day is bright, likely midday, with clear skies casting strong sunlight over the scene. A car is prominently featured, drifting across the track, creating thick plumes of white smoke that trail behind it. The car is sleek, with a dark body and vibrant decals, including a notable logo on the side. The surrounding landscape is barren, with sandy hills in the background, emphasizing the desolate environment. The drone's perspective provides a dynamic view of the car's movement, highlighting the speed and precision of the drift against the stark, open backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies a drone shot of a car drifting on an asphalt track in an arid environment under a bright sun. The descriptions of the car, smoke, and landscape appear to be a correct representation of the visual content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It successfully includes the:\n*   **Point of View:** \"filmed by a drone\"\n*   **Setting:** \"outdoor setting on a dry, expansive asphalt track surrounded by arid, rocky terrain\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** \"bright... midday, with clear skies casting strong sunlight\"\n*   **Notable Elements & Motion:** \"A car... drifting across the track, creating thick plumes of white smoke\"\n\nHowever, it does not mention any overlays (text, watermarks) or scene transitions, which would be an omission if they are present in the video.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails significantly in its adherence to the stylistic and content restrictions.\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Speculative Language**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...likely midday...\"\n    *   **Feedback:** The word \"likely\" is speculative and is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. It should state the observable conditions, such as \"during the day under a bright sun.\"\n\n*   **Violation 2: Explaining Emphasis or Highlights**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...emphasizing the desolate environment.\" and \"...highlighting the speed and precision of the drift...\"\n    *   **Feedback:** The caption directly violates this rule twice by interpreting the filmmaker's intent and explaining what the shot composition or action highlights. The final sentence is almost entirely dedicated to this type of analysis.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...sleek...\", \"...desolate environment.\", \"The drone's perspective provides a dynamic view...\", \"...precision of the drift...\", \"...stark, open backdrop.\"\n    *   **Feedback:** Words like \"desolate,\" \"dynamic,\" and \"precision\" are subjective interpretations. \"Sleek\" and \"stark\" are also borderline subjective. The description should stick to objective, observable qualities (e.g., \"barren\" instead of \"desolate,\" \"the car moves quickly\" instead of mentioning \"speed and precision\").\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the scene, it breaks fundamental rules of the prompt by including speculation, subjective analysis, and explanations of cinematic emphasis, making it a poor fit for the given instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video, filmed by a drone, shows an outdoor setting on a dry, expansive asphalt track surrounded by arid, rocky terrain. The scene is captured during the day under a bright sun with clear skies. A car is featured, drifting across the track and creating thick plumes of white smoke. The car has a dark body with vibrant decals and a notable logo on the side. The surrounding landscape includes sandy hills in the background. The drone's perspective offers a view of the car's movement against the open backdrop.",
