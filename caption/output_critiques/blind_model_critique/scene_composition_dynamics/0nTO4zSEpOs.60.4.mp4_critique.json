    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor urban setting at night, featuring a bustling cityscape with modern architecture. The scene is set in a well-lit area with tall buildings, including one prominently displaying the \"GMO\" logo.

The city lights illuminate the area, reflecting off the glass and metal surfaces, creating a vibrant atmosphere.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video's content and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres to most of the instructions, but it has a few specific and important shortcomings.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a modern, outdoor urban cityscape at night. The descriptions of the tiled walkway, glass railings, the \"GMO\" logo on a building, and the presence of pedestrians are all correct and verifiable from the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing - Point of View (POV):** This is the most significant omission. The instruction explicitly requires mentioning the POV. The video is shot from a **first-person perspective**, as if the viewer is walking through the scene. This is a crucial detail that defines the viewer's experience, and it is missing from the caption.\n*   **Missing - Specific Location:** The instruction states, \"If the location is known, state it explicitly.\" The \"GMO\" building is a well-known landmark in Shibuya, Tokyo. The caption should have identified the location as **Shibuya, Tokyo** to be fully complete.\n*   **Missing - Motion:** While it mentions \"people are walking,\" it fails to describe the primary motion of the scene, which is the camera's forward movement from the first-person perspective.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\n*   **Violation - Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses the word **\"vibrant\"** (\"creating a vibrant atmosphere\"), which is a subjective term describing a feeling or quality rather than a neutral observation. It also uses the word **\"bustling,\"** which is borderline subjective.\n*   **Violation - Explaining the Scene's Effect:** The phrase \"creating a vibrant atmosphere\" explains the *effect* of the lights, which violates the rule: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" A better description would simply state the facts, such as \"City lights and digital billboards illuminate the scene, with reflections visible on glass and metal surfaces.\"\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully follows many rules: it is a single paragraph, avoids forbidden words like \"image,\" correctly identifies overlays, and describes the environment and subjects without excessive detail.\n\nHowever, it fails on three key points:\n1.  It completely omits the required **Point of View**.\n2.  It uses a forbidden **subjective adjective** (\"vibrant\").\n3.  It misses the opportunity to name the **specific, identifiable location**.",
