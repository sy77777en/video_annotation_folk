    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an intense scene featuring a character in a dynamic pose, set against a stark, minimalistic background. The environment is undefined, with a focus on the character who is wearing a black and white sports uniform with the number 18. Red, lightning-like energy surrounds the character, adding a sense of motion and intensity. The character's expression and posture suggest action, with the red energy providing a vivid contrast to the otherwise monochrome setting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the character's centrality and the dramatic visual elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the provided rules:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be factually accurate based on the description it provides (a character in a uniform with red energy). However, its accuracy is compromised by the inclusion of subjective interpretations rather than objective descriptions.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete. It fails to mention several required elements:\n*   **Time of Day:** There is no mention of whether it is day, night, or an ambiguous time.\n*   **Environment Details:** It describes the background as \"stark, minimalistic\" and \"undefined,\" which is too vague. The instructions ask for descriptive features, such as \"a solid gray background\" or \"a white void.\"\n*   **Motion:** It describes a \"sense of motion\" but does not describe any actual movement in the video, such as the character moving, the camera panning, or the energy crackling or pulsing.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention if there are any overlays (text, watermarks, etc.) or confirm their absence.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates multiple negative constraints and core directives:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses words like \"intense scene,\" \"dynamic pose,\" and \"dramatic visual elements.\" These are subjective interpretations of the mood and action, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"The character's expression and posture suggest action\" is a direct violation of this rule. It infers intent and action rather than describing the visible posture itself.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption repeatedly breaks this rule. It states there is a \"focus on the character,\" that the point of view is \"emphasizing the character's centrality,\" and that the energy \"add[s] a sense of motion and intensity.\" These phrases explain the artistic effect and focus, which is forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** The caption does the exact opposite. The entire description is centered on the character, their pose, their uniform, and the energy around them. The setting is dismissed as \"undefined.\" The instructions require the setting to be the primary focus.\n*   **Vague Point of View:** The caption uses the term \"objective point of view,\" which is a cinematic term, not a physical one like \"first-person,\" \"drone shot,\" or \"stationary eye-level shot\" as requested. It also breaks the rules by explaining how the POV \"influences the viewer’s perception\" (\"emphasizing the character's centrality\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is written like a piece of artistic analysis rather than the objective, scene-focused description the instructions demanded. It prioritizes the subject over the setting and injects subjective, interpretive, and speculative language, all of which are explicitly forbidden.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a character in a black and white sports uniform with the number 18, surrounded by red, lightning-like energy. The background is a solid gray, creating a stark contrast with the character. It is unclear whether it is day or night. The character is in a static pose, with no visible movement from the character or the camera. There are no overlays or text present in the scene. The point of view is a stationary eye-level shot, focusing on the character against the minimalistic setting.",
