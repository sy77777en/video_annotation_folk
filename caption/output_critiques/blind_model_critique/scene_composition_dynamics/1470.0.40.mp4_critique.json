    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting, specifically a narrow hallway with a closed door at the end. The environment is characterized by neutral-colored walls and a wooden door with a simple design. A notable feature is a vintage-style wall-mounted telephone with a coiled cord, adding a retro element to the scene. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window with blinds, casting soft shadows. The scene transitions from a moment of interaction with the telephone to a quieter, empty hallway, emphasizing the stillness and simplicity of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the scene, but it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Cannot be verified:** Without the video, it's impossible to confirm if the visual details (narrow hallway, wooden door, vintage phone, window with blinds) are accurate. Assuming they are, the description seems plausible.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Mostly Complete:** The caption successfully covers the setting (indoor hallway), time of day (daytime), notable visual elements (phone, door), and a scene transition.\n*   **Missing Element:** The caption does not mention the **point of view** (e.g., static shot, handheld, first-person). The instructions require this to be specified if relevant, and it is almost always relevant to describe how the scene is being presented to the viewer.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n*   It combines details from different moments in the video (interaction with the phone vs. empty hallway).\n*   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It describes the color and material of notable objects (neutral walls, wooden door).\n\n**Where it fails to adhere:**\n1.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"**\n    *   The last sentence, \"...**emphasizing the stillness and simplicity of the space**,\" is a direct violation of this rule. It interprets the *effect* of the scene rather than just describing what is visible.\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"**\n    *   The word \"**quieter**\" is subjective. A better description would be to state what changed, such as \"The scene transitions from a person interacting with the telephone to a view of the empty hallway.\"\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"**\n    *   The phrase \"**The lighting suggests daytime...**\" uses the speculative word \"suggests.\" A more direct and compliant phrasing would be, \"Daylight filters through a window with blinds...\"\n\n4.  **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"**\n    *   The phrase \"**adding a retro element to the scene**\" is an interpretation of the phone's stylistic contribution. The instruction is to describe the object itself (\"a vintage-style wall-mounted telephone\"), not the effect it has on the scene's overall style.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not good because it repeatedly breaks the negative constraints outlined in the instructions. While it captures the basic visual information, it adds a layer of interpretation, subjectivity, and speculation that is explicitly forbidden. To be compliant, it would need to be rewritten to be purely descriptive, removing all interpretive language (\"emphasizing,\" \"adding a retro element\"), subjective terms (\"quieter\"), and speculative phrasing (\"suggests\"). It also needs to include the point of view.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor setting, specifically a narrow hallway with a closed wooden door at the end.
