    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

A second person is faintly visible in the passenger seat, and a thin white string hangs down near the center of the windshield.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and serves as a perfect example of how to follow the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the point of view (outside the car looking in), the setting (car cabin at night), the subjects (driver and passenger), and the key visual elements (the intensifying reddish-orange light, the reflection on the windshield, and the hanging string). Every detail mentioned in the caption is present in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It successfully incorporates all the required components from the instructions:\n    *   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"viewed from outside a car, looking through the front windshield.\"\n    *   **Setting & Time of Day:** Correctly identified as \"into the cabin at night.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** The \"intense, warm, reddish-orange light,\" its reflection, and the \"thin white string\" are all included.\n    *   **Motion:** The change in the scene is perfectly captured with \"This light intensifies slightly.\"\n    *   **Subjects:** The subjects are described with appropriate context and placement (\"bald man... in the driver's seat,\" \"second person... in the passenger seat\") without excessive detail.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres strictly to all rules:\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n    *   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It remains objective, using descriptive adjectives (\"intense,\" \"warm\") to describe the physical properties of the light rather than emotional tone.\n    *   It avoids speculation about the source of the light or the nature of the event.\n    *   It focuses on the overall scene and setting, with the dominant light being the central descriptive element.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and clear.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model execution of the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and follows every positive and negative constraint perfectly.",
