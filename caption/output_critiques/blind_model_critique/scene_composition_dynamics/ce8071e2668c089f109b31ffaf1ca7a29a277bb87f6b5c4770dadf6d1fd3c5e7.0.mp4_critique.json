    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wide, static view of the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan during the day. In the foreground, a large dune of fine, reddish-orange sand slopes downward, its crest marked by the footprints of three people standing near the top. Their long shadows are cast across the smooth surface of the sand. In the background, a vast expanse of rugged, layered sandstone mountains and cliffs rises under a pale blue, hazy sky, creating a dramatic and expansive landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the location as Wadi Rum and the drone's point of view, but it incorrectly describes the shot as \"static.\" The drone is actually performing a very slow, almost imperceptible pan from left to right, gradually revealing more of the vast mountain range in the background. The description of the time as \"day\" is too general; the long shadows and the warm, golden light bathing the entire landscape clearly indicate it is late afternoon, a crucial detail that is omitted. The caption also misses key dynamic and textural elements, such as the fine sand visibly blowing across the dune's surface, creating a shimmering effect over the wind-formed ripples. While it mentions the three people, it fails to note that one of them is slowly walking along the crest, kicking up small puffs of sand. Furthermore, the description lacks depth by omitting the midground, where a small, white off-road vehicle is visible at the base of a distant cliff, which provides an important sense of scale. Lastly, the concluding phrase \"creating a dramatic and expansive landscape\" is a subjective interpretation that should be removed in favor of letting the objective details convey the scene's scale.",
