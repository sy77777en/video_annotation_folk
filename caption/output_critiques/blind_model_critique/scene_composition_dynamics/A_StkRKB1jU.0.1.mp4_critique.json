    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a high-rise office during daylight, with a large window offering a view of adjacent flat-roofed, light-colored stone buildings.

A silhouetted figure stands by the window, manipulating a dark, elongated object attached to the cable.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and provides a high-quality description that is accurate and objective. It successfully follows most of the detailed instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is highly accurate. All the elements mentioned—the high-rise office, daylight, the view of adjacent buildings, the shattered window, the desk with a bag and cable, and the silhouetted figure manipulating an object—are present in the video and described correctly. The description of the buildings as \"flat-roofed, light-colored stone\" is a precise and reasonable interpretation of the visual information.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Very Good:** The caption is nearly complete.\n*   **What it includes:** It successfully captures the setting (high-rise office), time of day (daylight), key environmental features (adjacent buildings), notable props (desk, bag, cable), the main subject (silhouetted figure), and the primary action (manipulating an object).\n*   **What it's missing:** The instructions specifically ask to \"indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" The caption does not mention that the scene is captured from a static, third-person point of view. While not a major omission, it is a specific requirement that was missed.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to the stylistic and content constraints.\n*   **Follows \"Do\" Rules:**\n    *   It is concise yet informative.\n    *   It describes the overall scene by combining details logically.\n    *   It correctly identifies the subject's placement and context without excessive detail (\"A silhouetted figure stands by the window...\").\n    *   It uses simple, natural English.\n    *   It correctly describes the motion in the scene (\"manipulating a dark, elongated object\").\n*   **Follows \"Don't\" Rules:**\n    *   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery.\n    *   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., it says \"shattered,\" not \"violently shattered\").\n    *   It avoids speculation (e.g., it doesn't guess what the object is or why the window is broken).\n    *   It does not infer the role of the setting or explain what the scene emphasizes.\n    *   It is formatted as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is excellent and almost perfectly aligns with the instructions. Its strength lies in its objectivity, accuracy, and adherence to the negative constraints. The only minor point of improvement would be to explicitly state the point of view to be in full compliance with the provided guidelines.",
