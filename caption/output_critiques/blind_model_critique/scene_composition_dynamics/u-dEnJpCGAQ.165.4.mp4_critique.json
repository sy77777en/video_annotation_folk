    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback you requested is below:\n\nWhile the caption accurately captures the general scenery and color palette, it lacks specificity regarding key visual dynamics and perspective. It fails to mention the point of view, which appears to be a sweeping drone shot from a high angle, tracking alongside the herd and emphasizing the vastness of the savanna. The description of motion is understated; the video clearly shows the elephants' slow, deliberate gait, kicking up faint clouds of dust around their feet, and a gentle breeze causes the tall, dry grass to ripple in waves around them. Describing the elephants merely as \"dark grey forms\" is a missed opportunity, as the high-resolution footage reveals the wrinkled texture of their skin and the distinct presence of a much smaller calf walking close to its mother. Furthermore, the \"small, dark, rounded mounds\" are clearly identifiable as reddish-brown termite mounds, a defining feature of the landscape that the caption generalizes. The \"soft, diffuse light\" is more specifically the warm, low-angled light of late afternoon, casting long, faint shadows from the elephants onto the golden grass. Finally, the caption omits the presence of a semi-transparent watermark for a nature documentary channel in the bottom-right corner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a sweeping high-angle drone perspective, a herd of elephants moves gracefully across the vast savanna, their slow, deliberate gait kicking up faint clouds of dust around their feet. The high-resolution footage captures the wrinkled texture of their dark grey skin, with a smaller calf walking closely beside its mother. The tall, golden-yellow dry grass ripples in waves from a gentle breeze, while scattered low green bushes and distinct reddish-brown termite mounds dot the landscape.
