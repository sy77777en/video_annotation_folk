    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from a bed in a room with a high, vaulted ceiling supported by exposed wooden beams. Two large skylights are set into the ceiling, allowing daylight to enter the otherwise dimly lit space. The ornate, black metal footboard of the bed, featuring brass-colored finials, is positioned in the center of the view. On either side, large wooden posts are fitted with wall sconces that cast a warm, orange glow. A pair of bare feet rest on the white bedding at the bottom of the scene, and a wooden railing is visible in the background, suggesting a loft setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good, but with one minor area for improvement. It successfully captures the scene's key elements while adhering to most of the stylistic constraints.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It precisely identifies the point of view, the setting, and the notable visual elements. Details like the \"high, vaulted ceiling,\" \"exposed wooden beams,\" \"ornate, black metal footboard,\" and \"brass-colored finials\" are specific and paint a clear picture of the scene. The description of the lighting, with daylight from the skylights and a \"warm, orange glow\" from the sconces, is also very effective.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It includes all the required components:\n*   **Point of View:** \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n*   **Environment/Setting:** \"from a bed in a room,\" which clearly establishes an indoor setting.\n*   **Time of Day:** \"daylight\" indicates the time.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It thoroughly describes the ceiling, beams, skylights, bed, sconces, bedding, and railing, including their materials and colors.\n*   **Subjects:** The \"pair of bare feet\" are included in a way that complements the scene without being the primary focus, as instructed.\n\nThe only potential omission is the description of motion. If the video is completely static, the caption is perfect in this regard. If there is subtle movement (e.g., the feet wiggling, dust motes floating in the light), that detail is missing.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions very well, with one small exception.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **No Speculation (Mostly):** It avoids ambiguous terms like \"appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. \"Ornate\" is used as a descriptive term for the style of the metalwork, which is appropriate.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The primary focus is on the room and its features, with the subject (feet) mentioned only in context.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n*   **Inference:** The phrase \"**suggesting a loft setting**\" violates the instruction, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" While the wooden railing does imply a loft, the instruction requires describing only what is visible, not the conclusions drawn from it. A more compliant description would be: \"...and a wooden railing is visible in the background.\" This states the fact without interpreting it.",
