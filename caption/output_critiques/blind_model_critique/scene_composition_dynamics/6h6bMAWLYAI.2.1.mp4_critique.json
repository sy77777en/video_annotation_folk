    "pre_caption": "A television broadcast-style viewpoint captures an indoor news studio, where three presenters stand before a large, multi-panel video wall. The backdrop displays a high-angle view of a sprawling desert landscape, showing a mix of developed areas and reddish-brown earth. The sky in the image is divided, with one section showing clear blue with sun rays and another filled with dark, dramatic clouds. The text \"ARIZONA'S WEATHER AUTHORITY\" is overlaid on the center of the scene. The physical set surrounding the video screen consists of horizontal wooden slats with integrated warm, orange backlighting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A television broadcast-style viewpoint.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the news studio setting and the main visual components, but it lacks detail regarding the scene's composition and motion. The \"television broadcast-style viewpoint\" is actually a static, medium-wide shot that remains fixed throughout, and it fails to mention the glossy, dark floor which reflects the orange backlighting and the video wall. The description of the three presenters \"standing\" is incomplete; the central presenter stands and gestures towards the screen, while the two on the sides are seated behind a sleek, white anchor desk that is a prominent feature in the foreground. The caption also misses the dynamic nature of the video wall's content; the \"dramatic clouds\" are not static but are part of a time-lapse sequence, slowly moving and swirling across the screen. Furthermore, the overlay text \"ARIZONA'S WEATHER AUTHORITY\" is not just centered but is part of a larger graphical package in the upper third of the screen, which includes a station logo and a subtle animated shimmer. Finally, the description of the video wall as \"multi-panel\" could be more specific by noting that the thin black bezels between the screens are visible, slightly segmenting the desert landscape.",
