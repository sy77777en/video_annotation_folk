The players are wearing white jerseys with blue and green accents, featuring the words \"RAPID CITY\" in blue text across the chest and large green numbers.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video:\nThe video is a steady, eye-level shot from the perspective of someone on a football field, looking towards the home team's sideline. It's a bright, sunny day, and the artificial turf is a vibrant green with crisp white yard lines in the foreground. A line of players in \"RAPID CITY\" jerseys stands on the sideline, not perfectly still but shifting their weight, some looking onto the field and others talking amongst themselves. The bright sun casts distinct shadows behind them on the turf. Near the players are several large, blue Gatorade coolers and a few coaches wearing headsets and team-branded polo shirts. In the background, the stadium's concrete stands are packed with a blurred crowd. While there are many colors, a large, distinct section of the crowd is a sea of yellow, suggesting they are the visiting team's supporters. Above this section, a large electronic scoreboard is visible, displaying the game score and a running clock. The camera holds this shot without any cuts or transitions.\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption accurately describes the players' uniforms and the general setting, it misses several key visual and contextual details that would create a more complete picture. The description fails to specify the point of view, which is an eye-level shot from the field that places the viewer directly in the action. It portrays a static scene, whereas the players are subtly moving and interacting, and it omits the motion of the game clock on the large electronic scoreboard visible above the stands. The environment description is incomplete; it should include the vibrant green artificial turf and white yard lines in the foreground, the bright sunlight casting sharp shadows, and other sideline elements like blue water coolers and coaches in team apparel. Additionally, describing the crowd as having \"many\" wearing yellow is vague; specifying that the yellow-clad spectators are concentrated in a specific section would better convey the dynamic of a home versus visiting crowd.",
