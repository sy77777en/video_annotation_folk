    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors, featuring a long corridor with a large black-and-white mural of a basketball player with outstretched arms on the wall. The setting is well-lit with a modern, minimalist design, characterized by clean lines and a smooth floor. The time of day is not specified due to the indoor environment. A person is present, walking along the corridor, facing the mural, which dominates the scene. Overlay text appears in the lower part of the scene, providing additional information or context.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor corridor setting and the prominent black-and-white mural, but it lacks the specificity and objectivity required by the instructions. The point of view is omitted; the video is a third-person tracking shot following a person from behind, which is a crucial detail for describing the viewer's experience. The description of the environment is too general; \"smooth floor\" could be improved to \"polished, dark gray concrete floor that creates a slight reflection of the overhead lights,\" and \"well-lit\" could be specified as \"illuminated by a series of spotlights on the ceiling, casting a focused light onto the mural wall.\" The caption also includes interpretive and unnecessary statements, such as explaining why the time of day is not specified and speculating on the purpose of the overlay text (\"providing additional information or context\"). Furthermore, it uses subjective language like \"calm and focused\" and explains the mural's role (\"serving as a central visual element\"), which violates the instructions. The description of the overlay is vague; it should specify its appearance, such as \"An overlay in the lower-left corner displays the text 'Legacy Hall' in a white, sans-serif font.\" Finally, while a person is mentioned, their motion could be described more precisely, such as \"a person walks at a steady pace down the center of the corridor toward the far end.\"",
