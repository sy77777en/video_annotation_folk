    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but incomplete. It successfully follows many of the instructions but misses a few key requirements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a \"spacious, open-plan office,\" notes the \"tiled ceiling and fluorescent lighting,\" and accurately describes the \"black, boxy television\" and its content (\"news footage of a skyscraper with a large plume of dark smoke\"). The identification of the \"BARCLAYS STOCKBROKERS\" sign and the description of people \"looking up at the television\" are also correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits several required details:\n*   **Point of View:** The instruction requires specifying the point of view (e.g., eye-level, handheld, static shot), which is missing from the caption.\n*   **Time of Day:** The caption does not mention the time of day (e.g., daytime), which is another required element.\n*   **Motion:** While it mentions the \"smoke rising,\" it does not describe the overall motion of the shot itself, such as whether it is static, handheld, or panning.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   It provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n    *   It correctly identifies the indoor setting and specific location details (\"BARCLAYS STOCKBROKERS\").\n    *   It describes notable visual elements (television, sign) with details on color and shape.\n    *   It describes the subjects (people) in context without excessive detail.\n    *   It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\").\n    *   It does not infer the purpose of the scene or explain what it emphasizes.\n\n*   **Where it falls short:**\n    *   It fails to include the **point of view** and **time of day**, both explicitly requested in the instructions.\n    *   The description of the \"news ticker\" is slightly ambiguous. The instructions state to identify overlays on the video itself, but the ticker is an element within the news footage shown on the television, not an overlay on the primary video. The caption does not make this distinction clear.\n\nIn summary, the caption is well-written, accurate, and adheres to most of the stylistic and negative constraints. However, its failure to include the required point of view and time of day makes it incomplete and not fully compliant with the instructions.",
