    "pre_caption": "An overhead POV shot, positioned directly above the subject, captures a food preparation scene on a light-colored, weathered wood plank surface. In the center, a hand uses a metal wire whisk to rapidly mix chopped green herbs and a white powder within a large, clear glass bowl. Surrounding the bowl are various ingredients and tools, including a bunch of fresh green herbs, several whole and halved green limes, and a red plastic measuring spoon. To the right, a glass mason jar filled with a white substance is labeled \"SEA SALT.\" In the background, a silver bowl holds more whole limes. The scene is brightly lit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video. It is a high-quality description that effectively follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the point of view as an \"overhead POV shot\" and precisely describes the central action of a hand whisking ingredients in a glass bowl. The details of the surrounding items—such as the \"weathered wood plank surface,\" \"green limes,\" \"red plastic measuring spoon,\" and the \"glass mason jar filled with a white substance... labeled 'SEA SALT'\"—are specific and factually correct based on the visual information.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive and includes all the necessary elements requested in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as an \"overhead POV shot.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** The setting is described as a \"food preparation scene on a light-colored, weathered wood plank surface,\" which effectively establishes the environment.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It meticulously describes the key objects, including their color (\"green herbs,\" \"red plastic\"), material (\"metal wire whisk,\" \"clear glass bowl\"), and distinguishing features (\"weathered wood,\" \"labeled 'SEA SALT'\").\n*   **Motion:** The action is described with the phrase \"rapidly mix,\" capturing the movement in the scene.\n*   **Lighting:** The lighting condition is noted as \"brightly lit.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels in its adherence to the specific stylistic and content rules:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full picture of the scene without unnecessary words.\n*   **No Subjective Language:** It avoids emotional or speculative words (e.g., \"delicious,\" \"beautiful,\" \"appears to be\"). \"Weathered\" is a descriptive, objective term for the wood's texture.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** While a hand is mentioned, the focus remains on the overall scene, the ingredients, and the tools, as instructed.\n*   **No Inference:** The caption describes a \"food preparation scene\" based on direct observation and does not infer a specific role (e.g., \"a chef's kitchen\").\n*   **Correct Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Simple Language:** The description uses clear, natural English that is easy to understand.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"",
