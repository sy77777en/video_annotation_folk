    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up view of a textured surface, possibly paper, with handwritten numbers and text. The setting is indoors, with a focus on the material's surface, which is marked by dark ink and appears to be slightly crumpled. The lighting is low, casting a bluish tint over the scene, creating a contrast with the reddish hue of the paper. The surface is speckled with what looks like small, reflective particles, adding a shimmering effect. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are prominently visible, suggesting a focus on these details. The overall atmosphere is intimate and detailed, emphasizing the texture and markings on the paper.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to follow several key negative constraints in the instructions. While it accurately identifies many visual elements, it violates the rules against using speculative language, inferring emphasis, and including subjective descriptions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the scene's content. It correctly identifies the close-up view, the textured surface, the handwritten numbers (\"87,000\" and \"90,000\"), the crumpled state, the dark ink, the dual-toned lighting (bluish and reddish), and the reflective particles.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption is reasonably complete. It mentions the point of view (\"close-up\"), setting (\"indoors\"), and key visual elements (surface texture, lighting, markings). It correctly omits details that are not present, such as motion, overlays, or scene transitions.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following critical ways:\n\n1.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions explicitly state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption uses \"…a textured surface, **possibly paper**…\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption states the surface \"**appears to be** slightly crumpled.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption describes the surface as \"speckled with **what looks like** small, reflective particles…\"\n    *   **Correction:** The description should state only what is visible, such as \"a crumpled, textured surface\" and \"speckled with small, reflective particles.\"\n\n2.  **Inferring Emphasis or Intent:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption says, \"...**suggesting a focus on** these details.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The final sentence states, \"**emphasizing the texture** and markings on the paper.\"\n    *   **Correction:** The caption should simply describe the elements without interpreting the creator's intent or what the scene is trying to draw attention to.\n\n3.  **Use of Subjective and Emotional Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption describes the \"overall atmosphere\" as \"**intimate** and detailed...\"\n    *   **Correction:** \"Intimate\" is a subjective feeling or interpretation of the scene's mood, which should be avoided in favor of objective, factual descriptions.\n\nIn summary, the caption writer correctly identified the visual components but failed to present them according to the strict, objective, and non-interpretive style demanded by the instructions. The repeated use of speculative phrases, interpretations of focus, and subjective descriptors makes it a poor fit for the provided guidelines.",
