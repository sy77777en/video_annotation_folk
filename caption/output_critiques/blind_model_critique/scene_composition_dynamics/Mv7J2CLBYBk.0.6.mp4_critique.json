    "pre_caption": "The scene takes place in a spacious, modern indoor hall with white paneled walls and a highly reflective, glossy gray floor that mirrors the surroundings. The area is evenly lit by artificial overhead lighting. A white and black golf cart-style vehicle, featuring a blue and white logo on its side, is positioned in the space. A person dressed in black performs an acrobatic flip in mid-air next to the cart, subsequently landing and rolling on the polished floor. In the background, a white door and a set of double doors with glass panels are visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

It effectively and accurately describes the scene while adhering to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is successful:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a \"spacious, modern indoor hall,\" the \"white paneled walls,\" and the \"highly reflective, glossy gray floor.\" The description of the \"white and black golf cart-style vehicle\" with its \"blue and white logo\" is precise. The action of the person performing an \"acrobatic flip... landing and rolling\" is also described exactly as it happens.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering all the key elements. It establishes the environment, describes the main objects and their features, and details the central action from start to finish. It also includes background details like the doors, providing a full picture of the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Tone:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids emotional or subjective language, using descriptive adjectives like \"spacious,\" \"modern,\" and \"glossy\" to convey the visual style factually.\n    *   **Focus:** It successfully balances the description of the setting with the subject's action, using the action to provide context without making it the sole focus, as instructed.\n    *   **Forbidden Content:** The caption correctly avoids speculation (like \"it appears\"), forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), and does not infer the specific purpose of the location (e.g., calling it a showroom or factory).\n    *   **Motion:** The description of the movement is excellent, capturing the entire sequence of the flip, landing, and roll as a continuous event.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is delivered as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, following the output requirements perfectly.\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example of following the detailed instructions to produce a clear, objective, and thorough description of the video content.",
