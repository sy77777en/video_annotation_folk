    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a dramatic outdoor scene set during the day, featuring a group of colossal figures with exposed muscle structures, towering over a landscape. The sky is filled with large, fluffy clouds, and the sun is partially visible, casting a warm glow. The figures are positioned near a waterfront area with a dock, where a ship is moored. The dock is lined with buildings featuring red-tiled roofs and industrial elements, suggesting a port setting. Smoke rises from the ship, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The overall atmosphere combines natural and industrial features, with the massive figures dominating the skyline.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in some aspects but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy & Completeness:\n\n*   **Good:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene's content. It correctly identifies the outdoor daytime setting, the colossal figures with exposed muscles, the waterfront/port environment, the ship, the buildings with red-tiled roofs, the cloudy sky, and the rising smoke.\n*   **Good:** It is comprehensive, covering the most significant visual elements and establishing a clear picture of the environment as a whole.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\nThe caption violates several specific negative constraints outlined in the instructions:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption begins with \"The video depicts a **dramatic** outdoor scene...\" The word \"dramatic\" is an emotional and subjective interpretation of the scene's mood, not a factual description of its contents.\n\n2.  **Inference and Speculation:** The instruction states, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Avoid speculative statements.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption says the industrial elements are \"**suggesting** a port setting.\" This is an inference. The instructions require stating what is visible (a dock, a ship, industrial buildings) rather than what those elements suggest.\n\n3.  **Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction explicitly says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The final sentence states, \"...with the massive figures **dominating the skyline**.\" This phrase explains the visual emphasis and compositional dominance of the figures, which is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Explaining an Element's Role:** The instruction is to describe elements factually, not explain their function in the composition.\n    *   **Violation:** The caption describes the smoke as \"**adding a dynamic element** to the scene.\" This explains the effect of the smoke rather than simply stating its presence and movement (e.g., \"Smoke rises from the ship\").\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the caption successfully provides a concise and factually accurate description of the video's visual content, it is **not a good caption** because it fails to follow four critical negative constraints. It introduces subjective language (\"dramatic\"), makes an inference (\"suggesting\"), and explains visual hierarchy and effect (\"dominating the skyline,\" \"adding a dynamic element\"), all of which are explicitly forbidden by the detailed instructions.",
