The scene takes place during the day, as indicated by the natural light filtering through the windows. The car's interior features a dashboard and steering wheel, with three individuals seated inside. The upholstery appears to be dark, complementing the overall muted color scheme.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has several key areas where it fails to adhere to the specific instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption successfully captures the general essence of the scene. It is concise and identifies several key elements like the setting, time of day, subjects, and overlay. However, it violates several negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding speculative and interpretive language.\n\n---\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The description of an indoor car scene with three people, a dashboard, and a Spike Lee quote overlay is factually accurate based on the information provided.\n*   **Inaccurate Language:** The description of the external environment as a \"tree-lined street\" is an inference based on \"blurred elements.\" The instruction is to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" Describing them as \"blurred trees\" would be more accurate than inferring the type of street.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Good:** The caption includes the point of view, setting (indoor/car), time of day, notable visual elements (dashboard, upholstery), and the overlay text.\n*   **Could be Improved:**\n    *   **Point of View:** \"Objective perspective\" is too general. The instructions ask for more specific terms like \"first-person,\" \"dashcam,\" or a description like \"from the back seat looking forward.\"\n    *   **Motion:** The caption does not mention if the car is moving or static. If there is motion (e.g., passing scenery, movement of people), this is a significant omission.\n    *   **Material/Texture:** The instructions ask for details like material or texture for notable elements. The caption mentions \"dark\" upholstery but could have described the material of the dashboard or steering wheel if visible.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThis is the area with the most significant issues.\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Speculative Statements:**\n    *   The caption uses \"**appears to be** dark,\" which directly contradicts the rule: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" It should state definitively, \"The upholstery is dark.\"\n    *   It uses \"**suggest** a tree-lined street,\" which is another form of speculation. It should describe only what is visible, such as \"blurred green and brown shapes\" or \"a blurred view of trees.\"\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives / Interpretation:**\n    *   The phrase \"**complementing** the overall muted color scheme\" is interpretive. It explains the relationship between colors, which falls under the instruction to \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption should simply state the facts: \"The upholstery is dark, and the scene has a muted color scheme.\"\n\n*   **Minor Deviation - Explanatory Phrasing:**\n    *   The phrase \"**as indicated by** the natural light filtering through the windows\" is slightly explanatory. A more direct and compliant approach would be to simply state the time of day and the presence of light, such as: \"The scene is set during the day, with natural light entering through the car windows.\"\n\n*   **Followed Instructions:**\n    *   The caption is a single paragraph.\n    *   It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay.\"\n    *   It avoids referring to \"frames\" or \"images.\"\n    *   It correctly focuses on the setting over providing excessive detail about the subjects.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Example Caption (Adhering to all rules)\n\nTo illustrate the feedback, here is a revised version of the caption that more strictly follows the instructions:\n\nFrom a fixed perspective inside a car, the indoor scene is set during the day. The interior features a dashboard, a steering wheel, and dark upholstery, with three individuals seated inside. Outside the windows, a blurred view of trees is visible. An overlay is positioned across the scene, displaying the quote: \"We were just doing it to show off.\" - Spike Lee.",
