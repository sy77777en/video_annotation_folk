    "pre_caption": "An underwater scene unfolds in the vast, blue expanse of the open ocean. A single, large, dark-colored fish is positioned in the middle of the frame, surrounded by a massive, dynamic school of smaller, silvery fish. The countless small fish swim in a fluid, swirling mass, filling the water around the larger creature. The water itself transitions from a bright, light blue at the top, where sunlight filters through, to a deeper, darker blue in the depths below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres to most of the instructions, but it contains one clear violation.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes a plausible underwater scene, correctly identifying the main subjects (a single large fish and a school of smaller fish) and their visual characteristics (dark-colored vs. silvery). The description of the water's color gradient, from light blue at the surface to dark blue below, is an excellent and accurate detail that establishes depth and lighting.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the required elements for a single, continuous scene:\n*   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly identifies the scene as an \"underwater scene\" in the \"open ocean.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Implies daytime by mentioning \"sunlight filters through.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Describes the color of the water and the fish, as well as the motion of the school (\"dynamic,\" \"fluid, swirling mass\").\n*   **Subjects:** Includes the fish and their placement (\"in the middle,\" \"surrounded by\") without excessive detail, complementing the overall scene as instructed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions well, with one notable exception.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids speculation, emotional adjectives, and inference about the scene's purpose.\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n*   It successfully combines details to describe the overall scene and motion without referring to specific moments.\n*   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery.\n\n**Violation:**\n*   The instructions explicitly state to **\"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\"** The caption violates this rule by using the word \"frame\" in the sentence: \"...positioned in the middle of the **frame**...\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent in its descriptive quality, accuracy, and adherence to the tone and structure required. However, the use of the forbidden word \"frame\" makes it non-compliant with a specific negative constraint. To be perfect, this one word should be replaced.\n\n**Example of a corrected sentence:**\n\"A single, large, dark-colored fish is positioned centrally, surrounded by a massive, dynamic school of smaller, silvery fish.\"",
