    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a very good caption that follows the instructions with a high degree of precision. However, there are a few minor omissions that prevent it from being perfect.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It uses specific, objective language to describe visual elements (e.g., \"arched windows with broken panes,\" \"hazy light in shades of teal, yellow, and red,\" \"white, serif text\"). The details are concrete and verifiable, leaving no room for misinterpretation.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes most of the required elements, but it is missing two key pieces of information requested in the instructions.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Environment & Setting:** It clearly establishes the scene as an \"indoors\" setting (\"within a... room\") and describes its features (\"dark, sparsely furnished,\" \"large, arched windows\").\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It excels at describing the light, furniture, and the text on the mug with appropriate detail regarding color and type.\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the title as an \"overlay,\" describing its content, color, font style, and placement. This is a perfect execution of that instruction.\n*   **Subjects:** It mentions \"a figure\" in a way that complements the scene without providing excessive detail, as instructed.\n*   **Motion/Changes:** It effectively describes the progression of the scene (\"As the scene progresses... becomes visible,\" \"An overlay... appears\").\n\n**What is missing:**\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly ask for the POV (e.g., first-person, static shot, slow pan). The caption does not mention this.\n*   **Time of Day:** The instructions ask for the time of day. While the caption describes the room as \"dark,\" it doesn't explicitly state if it is night, dusk, or simply a dark interior space during the day.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the stylistic and formatting rules.\n\n*   **Tone and Language:** It uses simple, natural English and maintains a neutral, descriptive tone, successfully avoiding emotional, subjective, or speculative language (\"might be,\" \"it appears\").\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery, with the subject being a minor element. It does not infer the purpose of the setting or what the scene emphasizes.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that logically flows from the general environment to specific details and overlays.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions, particularly regarding tone, detail, and structure. Its only weakness is the omission of the **point of view** and a clear statement on the **time of day**. Adding these two elements would make it a perfect response.\n\n**Example of a revised caption that includes the missing elements:**\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the scene is set at night within a dark, sparsely furnished room characterized by large, arched windows with broken panes. Hazy light in shades of teal, yellow, and red filters through the windows, revealing blurry exterior views. The room contains a modern office chair, a small side table, and a floor lamp that casts a spotlight on the central area. As the scene progresses, text reading \"WORLD'S BEST LORD\" becomes visible on a mug held by a figure. An overlay of white, serif text appears at the bottom, displaying the title \"THE LORD OF DOORS.\"",
