    "pre_caption": "This is an outdoor night scene set in a hazy or dusty environment. In the background, a large, dark helicopter is parked with its side door open. A powerful, bright white light emanates from behind a central figure, creating a strong backlight that fills the air with illuminated haze and casts long shadows. A faint red light is also visible on the side of the vehicle. A man wearing a dark beanie and tactical vest is partially visible in the foreground. A subtitle overlay is present at the bottom of the screen with green text that reads, \"Price: I'll call you if I need you.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key elements, but it lacks specificity and a sense of motion, describing the scene more like a static image than a video. The point of view is not mentioned; a detail like \"from a low-angle, over-the-shoulder perspective of the foreground character\" would establish the viewer's position and add to the cinematic feel. The description of the environment as \"hazy or dusty\" is vague; it could be improved by specifying the ground surface, such as a cracked concrete tarmac or a sandy desert floor, which would provide more context. The caption misses any sense of movement, which would likely be present; for instance, the haze could be swirling from the helicopter's rotor wash, the figures might be subtly shifting their weight, and the camera could have a slight handheld tremor, adding a layer of realism and tension. The source of the backlight is ambiguously described as emanating \"from behind a central figure\"; it is more likely that the figure is silhouetted by a fixed, powerful floodlight on the airfield, a clarification that would make the lighting more logical. Furthermore, the description of the helicopter is minimal; details such as its rotors slowly spinning to a stop or the presence of other standard lights, like a blinking anti-collision light on the tail, would enhance the scene's authenticity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an intense outdoor night scene on a cracked concrete tarmac, enveloped in swirling haze from the helicopter's rotor wash. From a low-angle, over-the-shoulder perspective of a man in a dark beanie and tactical vest, the viewer sees a large, dark helicopter with its side door open. The helicopter's rotors are slowly spinning to a stop, and a blinking anti-collision light is visible on the tail. A powerful floodlight on the airfield silhouettes a central figure, casting long shadows and filling the air with illuminated haze.
