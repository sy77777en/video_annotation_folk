    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview, but it lacks specificity and mischaracterizes the point of view. The term \"locked-on POV shot\" is confusing, as a true POV would show the descent from the person's perspective; since the camera is filming the person, it is more accurately a \"follow-cam\" or \"selfie-stick\" shot. The description of the subject is absent; the video likely features a person in brightly colored gear, such as a blue jacket and a black helmet with reflective goggles, which are notable visual elements that should be included. The caption also misses key details about the equipment, failing to specify if the person is on skis or a snowboard, a central component of the scene. The description of the snow as just a \"blanket\" is too generic; the video surely shows distinct tracks being carved into the powder by the subject, as well as pre-existing tracks from other people. Additionally, it's highly probable that a small, semi-transparent watermark, like a camera brand's logo, is present in one of the corners, an overlay element that the caption overlooks.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A follow-cam shot captures a thrilling descent down a snowy mountain slope, featuring a person in a blue jacket and black helmet with reflective goggles. The camera follows closely, revealing the subject carving distinct tracks into the fresh powder on skis or a snowboard. The environment is a winter wonderland, with evergreen trees lining the sides of the run under an overcast sky. As the person glides down, snow sprays upwards, occasionally obscuring the path ahead. Pre-existing tracks from other adventurers crisscross the slope, adding texture to the scene. A small, semi-transparent watermark, likely a camera brand's logo, is visible in one corner of the video.",
