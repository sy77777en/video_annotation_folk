    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures an outdoor construction scene during the daytime. From a concrete slab, the view looks down upon a low, partially constructed wall made of rectangular red bricks held by wet, dark gray mortar. A green plastic basin containing more mortar and a trowel with an orange handle rests on the concrete. Below this elevated area, the ground is unpaved, showing dirt, large rocks, and some green vegetation. The person's arm is visible holding a thin white string, and their lower body is dressed in a patterned garment and a light-colored shirt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the first-person point of view and the core elements of the construction scene, it misses the dynamic action central to the video. The description is static, detailing the setup with the trowel and mortar basin, but it omits the primary motion of the person actively laying bricks—scooping mortar with the trowel, spreading it on the wall, and carefully placing a new orange brick. Furthermore, for a first-person perspective focused on a manual task, the most prominent visual is the person's hands, which are not mentioned at all; the video clearly shows them wearing tan-colored, dirt-stained work gloves as they perform the work. The caption also lacks environmental context beyond the immediate work area; it fails to describe the bright, sunny sky with a few wispy clouds visible above the wall, or the partially built wooden frame of a larger structure in the distant background, which helps establish the scale of the project. Finally, the description of the person's attire as a \"patterned garment\" is too vague; the video shows they are wearing camouflage-patterned work pants.",
