    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors within a dimly lit, partially ruined brick structure. The environment features exposed, uneven brick walls and scattered debris, with a greenish tint dominating the scene, likely due to low light or night vision. A person in military gear, including a dark helmet with mounted equipment and a tactical vest, is positioned on the ground among the rubble, holding a black firearm. The subject’s uniform is dark with visible fabric texture and reinforced padding, and gloved hands are seen interacting closely, suggesting proximity and urgency. Overlay elements include green subtitles at the bottom center of the view, displaying dialogue between characters, which are not part of the physical scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it successfully captures some elements, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and structural requirements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption accurately describes a scene that is common in first-person shooter video games or action films. It correctly identifies the first-person POV, the indoor ruined brick setting, the military-style subject, the greenish color cast typical of night vision, and the presence of subtitle overlays.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Mostly Complete:** The caption includes the point of view, setting, environment, time of day (implied by \"dimly lit\" and \"greenish tint\"), and overlay elements.\n*   **Incomplete:** It fails to describe any **motion or changes**. The instructions specifically ask to describe movements like the camera panning, the subject moving, or environmental changes. The caption describes a static scene, which is unlikely for a video. For example, it doesn't mention if the character is walking, aiming, or if dust is falling.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant failures.\n\n*   **Violation - Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   The caption uses the phrase \"**likely due to** low light or night vision.\" This is a speculative assumption about the cause of the green tint, which violates the rule. It should simply state that the scene has a greenish tint.\n\n*   **Violation - Excessive Subject Detail:** The instruction states, \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\" and to avoid \"excessive detail\" on subjects.\n    *   The caption dedicates a significant portion to describing the person in great detail: \"military gear, including a dark helmet with mounted equipment and a tactical vest,\" \"uniform is dark with visible fabric texture and reinforced padding,\" and \"gloved hands.\" This shifts the focus away from the scene and onto the character, which is contrary to the instructions.\n\n*   **Violation - Inference and Subjectivity:** The instruction says, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   The caption states that the hands are seen interacting closely, \"**suggesting proximity and urgency**.\" The word \"urgency\" is an inferred emotional state and is subjective. This directly violates the instruction.\n\n*   **Minor Violation - Introductory Text:** The instruction asks to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n    *   The caption begins with \"The video is presented from...\" which is a form of introductory text. A more direct approach, as implied by the instructions, would be to start immediately with the description, such as \"From a first-person point of view, the scene is set indoors...\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is not good because it breaks several core rules laid out in the instructions. Its primary failures are engaging in speculation, providing excessive detail about the subject instead of the scenery, and inferring subjective states like \"urgency.\" While it accurately identifies the basic visual components, its failure to follow the negative constraints makes it a poor execution of the task.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person point of view, the scene unfolds indoors within a dimly lit, partially ruined brick structure. The environment features exposed, uneven brick walls and scattered debris, with a greenish tint dominating the scene.
