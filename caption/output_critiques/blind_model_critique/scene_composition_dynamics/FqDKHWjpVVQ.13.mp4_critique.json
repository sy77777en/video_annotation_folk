    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, depicts an outdoor urban setting during daytime. The scene is characterized by light-colored, blocky buildings; one such building has a small, dark, square window, and a nearby wall section is rough-textured and light brown. A dark-colored firearm is held in the foreground. In the distance, visible through a gap between structures, a brighter area contains green foliage and rocky terrain. The perspective shifts slightly.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and adheres very closely to the detailed instructions provided. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the specified formatting and stylistic rules.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Highly Accurate:** The description of the scene is precise. It correctly identifies the first-person POV, the outdoor urban setting, the daytime lighting, and the blocky, light-colored architecture.\n*   **Specific Details:** Details like the \"small, dark, square window,\" the \"rough-textured and light brown\" wall, the \"dark-colored firearm,\" and the distant \"green foliage and rocky terrain\" are all present in the video and described accurately.\n*   **Overlays:** The description of the overlay elements is spot-on. It correctly identifies the mini-map in the bottom-left, the blue data display in the bottom-right, and the red diamond and green rectangular icons superimposed on the environment.\n*   **Minor Point of Improvement:** The instruction asks to describe the shape of notable elements. While the caption describes the icons as \"diamond-shaped\" and \"rectangular,\" it refers to the \"mini-map\" without specifying its circular shape. Adding \"circular\" would make it even more precise (e.g., \"a circular mini-map\"). However, this is a very minor omission.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The caption successfully covers all the key aspects requested in the instructions. It includes the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, architectural features, and a description of all visible overlay elements.\n*   **Motion:** It correctly notes the subtle motion with the phrase \"The perspective shifts slightly,\" which accurately reflects the camera's movement.\n*   **No Missing Elements:** The caption does not omit any significant visual information. It provides a full, holistic view of the scene by combining details from the entire duration of the clip.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Formatting and Structure:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as instructed.\n*   **Tone and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"menacing\") and speculative statements (e.g., \"it seems to be,\" \"it might be\").\n*   **Focus:** The caption focuses on the setting and scenery rather than the subject, and it does not infer the role of the setting (e.g., it avoids calling it a \"battlefield\" or \"military zone,\" which would be an inference).\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and properly identifies HUD elements as \"overlays.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise while remaining informative, capturing the essential details without unnecessary wordiness.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is of very high quality. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the instructions and applies them effectively to the video content. The description is a clear, factual, and well-structured summary of the scene. The only potential improvement is a minor one regarding the shape of the mini-map, but as it stands, the caption is an excellent execution of the prompt.",
