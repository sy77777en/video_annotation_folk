    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** In a dark, undefined space with a faint grid pattern on the floor, a simple wooden table is positioned in the center. A translucent, blue, human-like figure stands behind the table. On the tabletop, a rectangular object emits a bright red glow. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the name \"Georg Elser\" in a white, typewriter-style font.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. Every detail mentioned is present in the video.\n*   The environment is correctly identified as a \"dark, undefined space\" with a \"faint grid pattern on the floor.\"\n*   The \"simple wooden table\" is accurately placed in the center.\n*   The description of the \"translucent, blue, human-like figure\" is precise regarding its color, transparency, shape, and position.\n*   The \"rectangular object\" on the table and its \"bright red glow\" are described correctly.\n*   The overlay is perfectly detailed, including its content (\"Georg Elser\"), placement (bottom left), color (white), and font style (typewriter-style).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and covers all the most significant visual information. It successfully synthesizes the scene into a single, coherent description. The only minor detail not included is the subtle, shimmering motion of the blue figure and the red glow, but given the static nature of the overall scene, this omission does not detract from the caption's quality. It also does not mention the point of view (a static, eye-level shot), but for a simple scene like this, it is not a critical omission.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the provided instructions.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively balances brevity with descriptive detail.\n*   **Focus and Tone:** It focuses on the setting and scenery, describing the subject (the figure) with appropriate context but without excessive detail. It uses simple, objective language and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative words (e.g., \"eerie,\" \"mysterious,\" \"it seems to be\").\n*   **Formatting and Prohibited Terms:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown. It correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"appears.\"\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay\" and describes it as instructed.\n*   **No Inference:** The caption does not infer the role of the setting or the meaning of the objects, sticking strictly to what is visible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a precise, objective, and thorough description that perfectly follows the detailed and restrictive instructions provided. It successfully captures the essence of the scene in a clear and professional manner.",
