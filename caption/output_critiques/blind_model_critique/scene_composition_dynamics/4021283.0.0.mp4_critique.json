    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape of terraced rice fields stretching across a rural area, with rectangular and irregular plots separated by narrow earthen ridges and filled with water or vibrant green crops. The fields are bordered by clusters of tall, leafy banana plants and patches of dense trees, with a forested area visible in the distance under a hazy sky. Small wooden huts with sloped roofs are scattered among the fields, and the ground appears wet, reflecting the overcast daylight. The overall scene is marked by the geometric arrangement of the fields, the lush greenery, and the presence of water channels running between the plots.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the vast majority of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-written. However, there are a couple of minor points where it slightly deviates from the strict guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key elements of a terraced rice field landscape: the drone's point of view, the geometric and irregular plots, the earthen ridges, the presence of water and green crops, surrounding vegetation like banana plants, and scattered wooden huts. The description of the environment, such as the \"hazy sky\" and \"overcast daylight,\" adds a precise layer of detail.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and successfully incorporates all the required components:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"filmed by a drone.\"\n*   **Setting:** Identified as an \"expansive outdoor landscape\" in a \"rural area\" with \"terraced rice fields.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Described as \"overcast daylight\" under a \"hazy sky.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It meticulously lists the fields, ridges, crops, water, banana plants, trees, and huts, describing their specific features (e.g., \"small wooden huts with sloped roofs,\" \"narrow earthen ridges\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly, but there are two minor areas for improvement:\n\n*   **Positive Adherence:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n    *   It successfully combines details into a holistic description without referring to specific frames.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery, keeping descriptions of elements like the huts minimal and contextual.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or overly subjective language. \"Vibrant\" and \"lush\" are used descriptively for color and density, which is acceptable.\n\n*   **Minor Deviations:**\n    1.  **Speculative Language:** The instruction states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The caption uses the phrase \"the ground **appears wet**.\" This is a minor violation. A more direct and confident statement, such as \"the wet ground reflects the overcast daylight,\" would align better with the rule.\n    2.  **Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The final sentence, \"The overall scene is **marked by** the geometric arrangement of the fields...\" comes very close to breaking this rule. While it summarizes key features, the phrasing \"marked by\" functions to point out what is notable or defining about the scene, which is a form of highlighting. These details could be integrated more seamlessly into the main description to avoid a concluding, summary-style statement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Overall, the caption is very good.** It is a high-quality description that is informative, concise, and well-structured. The minor deviations from the instructions are subtle and easily correctable. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the requirements, failing only on two small technicalities regarding speculative phrasing and highlighting key features.",
