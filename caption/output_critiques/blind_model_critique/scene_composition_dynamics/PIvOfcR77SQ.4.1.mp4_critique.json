    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene winter scene in a snowy, forested area. Tall evergreen trees with dark green foliage surround the setting, their trunks partially covered in snow. The ground is blanketed in a thick layer of snow, creating a smooth, white surface. A snowplow is visible, its metal blade contrasting against the snow, indicating recent clearing activity. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the landscape. A wooden cabin with a sloped roof, also covered in snow, is present, adding a rustic element to the scene. The cabin's dark wood contrasts with the white snow, and a small vehicle is parked nearby. The overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, typical of a winter day in a remote, wooded area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it accurately describes a plausible scene, it violates several key negative constraints and omits required information.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the visual details (snowy forest, evergreen trees, cabin, snowplow) are likely accurate. The description of colors (dark green foliage, white snow, dark wood) and materials (metal blade, wooden cabin) is also good.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to include a critical piece of information explicitly requested by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions state, \"If relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" The caption makes no mention of the camera's perspective, which is a mandatory element.\n*   **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene. If there is any motion in the video (e.g., falling snow, the snowplow moving, wind in the trees), the caption fails to mention it, which is another requirement.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several explicit negative constraints, which is its biggest flaw:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":**\n    *   The caption uses words like **\"serene,\" \"rustic,\" \"calm,\"** and **\"quiet.\"** These are all subjective interpretations of the atmosphere, not objective descriptions of visual facts.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Do not infer\":**\n    *   The phrase **\"indicating recent clearing activity\"** is an inference about what the snowplow did. The caption should only state that a snowplow is present.\n    *   The final sentence, **\"The overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, typical of a winter day in a remote, wooded area,\"** is almost entirely inference, generalization, and subjective assessment.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":**\n    *   The phrase **\"adding a rustic element to the scene\"** explains the *role* or *effect* of the cabin, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Concise yet informative\":**\n    *   The caption is not concise. The last two sentences are redundant and filled with forbidden subjective analysis, making the description unnecessarily long.\n\n### Corrected Example\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions for the same scene:\n\nFrom a stationary, eye-level point of view, this outdoor scene is set in a snowy, forested area during the day under an overcast sky. The ground is covered in a thick layer of white snow, which also blankets the sloped roof of a wooden cabin. The cabin is surrounded by tall evergreen trees with dark green foliage. Near the cabin, a snowplow with a metal blade and a small vehicle are parked on the snow.",
