    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\nThe caption is moderately effective at conveying the scene but fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding speculation, focus, and prohibited phrasing.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   The caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual content it mentions (low-angle view, metallic floor, dangling legs, various footwear).\n*   The description of the floor as \"textured, metallic\" is precise and accurate.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits required information:\n\n*   **Time of Day:** It does not mention whether the scene takes place during the day, at night, or during twilight.\n*   **Motion:** It only *suggests* motion. If the legs are visibly moving (e.g., swinging), the caption should state this directly (e.g., \"The legs sway gently\"). If they are static, it should not imply movement.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several core instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses \"hinting at a bustling fairground environment\" and \"suggesting the motion of a ride.\" The words \"hinting\" and \"suggesting\" are speculative and explicitly forbidden by the instructions. It should only describe what is clearly visible.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** The sentence \"The footwear varies, including dark sneakers, dark wedge boots worn with patterned leggings, and sandals\" provides excessive detail about the subjects' clothing. This shifts the focus away from the setting, which the instructions state should be the priority.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The phrase \"characteristic of an amusement park ride platform\" is an inference. While likely correct, a more direct description of the setting's visible features would be better.\n*   **Violation of \"without... introductory text\":** The caption begins with \"The video presents...,\" which is an introductory phrase that should be omitted.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the caption captures the general idea, its use of speculative language, excessive focus on subject details, and inclusion of introductory text make it a poor fit for the provided instructions. It needs to be rewritten to be more direct, objective, and focused on the environment.\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that better follows the instructions (assuming the background is blurry and there is gentle motion):\n\n**A low-angle view from a textured, metallic platform shows several pairs of legs dangling just above the surface. The legs, belonging to subjects seated out of view, sway slightly. In the out-of-focus background, blurred lights and indistinct structures are visible under a daytime sky.**",
