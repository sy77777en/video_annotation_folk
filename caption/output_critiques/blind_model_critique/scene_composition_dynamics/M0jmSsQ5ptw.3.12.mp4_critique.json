    "pre_caption": "The scene is set outdoors on a vast, paved surface, possibly an airfield, under a sky with scattered white clouds. A long, narrow, dark blue mat with a textured surface and white circular markers extends away from the camera's position. To the left of the mat stands a tall, continuous wall constructed from white fabric panels. To the right, the paved area is marked with double yellow lines. In the background, several low, industrial-style buildings are visible on the flat horizon. A person in athletic attire is on a small, raised platform situated on the mat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few significant areas for improvement to fully meet the requirements of the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The description of the visual elements is accurate and detailed. It correctly identifies the colors (dark blue, white, yellow), materials (paved, fabric), and shapes (long, narrow, circular) of the key objects in the scene.\n*   The placement of the subject and objects relative to each other is described logically.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption fails to explicitly state the point of view (e.g., \"a static, ground-level shot\"), which is a required element in the instructions. While \"extends away from the camera's position\" implies the POV, the instruction asks for a specific label.\n*   **Missing Time of Day:** The time of day (e.g., \"daytime\" or \"midday\") is not mentioned, despite being a required detail. The presence of \"scattered white clouds\" suggests daytime, but it should be stated directly.\n*   **Missing Motion:** The caption describes a static scene. If there is any movement in the video (e.g., the person performing an action, clouds moving), the caption omits this crucial information, which the instructions require.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The phrase \"**possibly an airfield**\" is a speculative statement. The instructions explicitly state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,'\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The caption should only describe what is visible (e.g., \"a vast, paved surface\") without guessing its function.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption successfully focuses on the setting and scenery rather than the subject.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n    *   It correctly describes notable visual elements with their specific features (color, material, texture).\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It is formatted as a single, coherent paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is well-written in its description of static objects but fails by including a speculative phrase (\"possibly an airfield\") and omitting required details like the point of view, time of day, and any potential motion within the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is set outdoors on a vast, paved surface under a sky with scattered white clouds, indicating daytime.
