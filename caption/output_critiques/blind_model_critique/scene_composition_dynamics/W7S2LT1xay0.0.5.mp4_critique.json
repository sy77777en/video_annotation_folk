    "pre_caption": "The scene is set inside a moving car at night. The vehicle's interior is dark, with the warm, brownish tones of a headrest visible. Through the car windows, the background is a blur of motion, with out-of-focus streetlights and other light sources streaking past, creating bright, circular patterns against the darkness. A person is seated in the driver's position, looking forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview but misses several key visual details that define the scene's atmosphere. It fails to specify the first-person point of view from the passenger seat, which is essential for understanding the viewer's immersion in the experience. While it mentions the dark interior, it omits the soft, ambient glow from the dashboard's speedometer and controls, which casts a subtle light on the driver's hands on the steering wheel. The description of the driver as \"a person\" is too generic; the lighting renders them as a distinct silhouette, making their features indiscernible. Furthermore, the caption neglects to mention the light rain, a critical element visible through the water beading on the side window and the slick, reflective surface of the road that enhances the streaking light effect. The \"brownish tones of a headrest\" could be more specific, as the video clearly shows it is made of textured brown leather. Finally, the caption completely overlooks the semi-transparent creator watermark present in the lower-right corner throughout the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds from a first-person perspective in the passenger seat of a moving car at night. The vehicle's interior is dimly lit, with a soft, ambient glow emanating from the dashboard's speedometer and controls, subtly illuminating the driver's hands on the steering wheel. The driver appears as a distinct silhouette, their features indiscernible against the darkness. The textured brown leather of the headrest is visible, adding warmth to the scene. Outside, light rain creates a mesmerizing effect, with water beading on the side window and the road's slick surface reflecting the streaking streetlights and other light sources, forming bright, circular patterns. A semi-transparent creator watermark is present in the lower-right corner throughout the video, adding a subtle layer to the visual experience.",
