    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a very good caption that closely follows the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It factually describes the subject (a bird with specific plumage, beak, and marking colors), its actions (standing, bathing, splashing), and the immediate environment (shallow, murky brown water with ripples and a lump of mud). All details are concrete and observable.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and covers nearly all the required elements:\n*   **Setting:** Clearly stated as \"outdoors\" and described as a \"small section of the muddy water body.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Correctly identified as \"daytime.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Excellent detail on the bird's colors (\"grey, white, and black plumage,\" \"yellow beak and facial marking\"), the water (\"murky brown,\" \"gentle ripples\"), and the environment (\"dark mud\").\n*   **Motion:** The caption effectively describes the motion of the water (\"gentle ripples caused by the bird's movements as it splashes\").\n*   **Point of View:** This is the only minor omission. The caption does not explicitly state the POV (e.g., \"close-up shot,\" \"eye-level shot\"). However, it implies a close-up by stating the scene is \"focused entirely on this small section,\" which is a good alternative.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates an excellent understanding of and adherence to the stylistic and content rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It successfully packs a lot of descriptive information into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** It balances the description of the subject with a detailed description of its immediate environment (the water, mud, and ripples), fulfilling the requirement to focus on setting and scenery.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, direct, and easy to understand.\n*   **Avoids Prohibited Elements:**\n    *   It correctly avoids emotional/subjective words (\"murky\" is a descriptive, not emotional, term for unclear water).\n    *   It does not use speculative language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   It avoids inferring the purpose of the scene (e.g., it doesn't say the bird is \"cleaning itself\").\n    *   It does not use forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It avoids introductory text and is formatted as a single paragraph.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a well-written, factual, and detailed description that adheres almost perfectly to a complex set of instructions. Its only minor weakness is the lack of an explicit POV statement, but it compensates well by describing the focused nature of the shot. The use of \"The video shows...\" is slightly redundant but acceptable.\n\nTo make it perfect, you could remove the opening phrase and integrate the POV:\n\n**Slightly Improved Version:**\n\"From a close-up perspective, a bird with grey, white, and black plumage and a distinct yellow beak and facial marking stands and bathes in shallow, murky brown water during the daytime. The water has gentle ripples caused by the bird's movements as it splashes, and a small lump of dark mud is visible near the bird on the left. The outdoor setting is focused entirely on this small section of the muddy water body.\"",
