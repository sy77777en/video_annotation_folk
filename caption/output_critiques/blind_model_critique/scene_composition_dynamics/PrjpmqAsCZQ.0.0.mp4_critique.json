    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit environment, likely at night, characterized by a green night-vision effect. The scene includes a person seated at a desk, surrounded by electronic equipment such as a keyboard and control panels. The equipment has illuminated buttons and screens, casting a faint glow. The person interacts with the devices, suggesting a focus on the technology present. The overall atmosphere is dark, with the green hue providing the primary source of visibility, highlighting the contours and details of the equipment and the person's actions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but has several significant flaws and omissions when measured against the detailed instructions. It captures the general mood but fails on key points of objectivity, completeness, and adherence to negative constraints.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of an indoor, dimly lit setting with a green night-vision effect, a person at a desk, and electronic equipment is accurate to the scene it describes.\n\n**Completeness (What's Missing):**\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption completely omits the point of view. The instructions explicitly require this (\"indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam\"). This is a critical missing detail as the POV heavily influences the viewer's perception.\n*   **Material, Shape, and Texture:** The instructions ask for descriptions of \"color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings\" for notable elements. The caption mentions \"electronic equipment\" but does not describe its material (e.g., dark plastic, brushed metal), shape (e.g., boxy, integrated into a console), or texture (e.g., matte, smooth).\n*   **Overlays:** The caption describes a \"green night-vision effect\" but doesn't clarify if this is a post-production filter applied to the whole scene or an in-scene overlay, like a Heads-Up Display (HUD). The instructions require specifying overlays and their content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions (Violations):**\n*   **Violation 1: Speculative Language.** The caption uses the phrase \"**likely at night**.\" The instructions explicitly state: \"**Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'**.\" The dim lighting is a fact; the time of day is an inference.\n*   **Violation 2: Inferring Emphasis.** The caption states, \"**suggesting a focus on the technology present**.\" The instructions forbid this: \"**Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights**.\" The description should state what is happening, not what the scene is trying to suggest or focus on.\n*   **Violation 3: Subjective/Interpretive Language.** The caption mentions the \"**overall atmosphere is dark**.\" The word \"atmosphere\" is subjective and interpretive. The instructions state: \"**Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives**.\" A more objective statement would be \"The scene is dark\" or \"The environment is dimly lit.\"\n*   **Violation 4: Explaining the Effect of an Element.** The caption ends with \"**highlighting the contours and details** of the equipment and the person's actions.\" This is another violation of the rule \"**Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights**.\" It describes the *function* of the light rather than simply stating what is visible.\n*   **Violation 5: Meta-Description.** The caption begins with \"The video depicts...\" While minor, the instructions ask for a direct description of the scene itself, not a description of the video as an object.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that adheres strictly to all the provided instructions, correcting the errors and filling in the missing information (assuming a first-person POV for demonstration).\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nFrom a first-person point of view, the scene is an indoor, dimly lit room viewed through a green night-vision filter. Directly ahead is a desk holding electronic equipment, including a keyboard and several dark, matte-finished control panels. These panels are fitted with numerous small, illuminated buttons and rectangular screens that emit a faint glow. A person is seated at the desk, and their hands can be seen moving as they interact with the controls.",
