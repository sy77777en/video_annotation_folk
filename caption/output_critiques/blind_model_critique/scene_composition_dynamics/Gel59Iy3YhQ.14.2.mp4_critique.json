    "pre_caption": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a square wooden kitchen platform suspended high in a cloudy, grey sky. The platform, which has small fires burning at its corners, is held by thick ropes attached to a large balloon structure above. The kitchen is outfitted with counters, a sink, and various food preparation stations. The view pulls away from the platform to show it is suspended from a large, pink, deflating balloon that is on fire, surrounded by floating debris against the overcast sky, before the scene is obscured by clouds. Several overlays are present: recipe cards are in the top left corner, a score and tip multiplier are in the bottom left, and a countdown timer is in the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It meticulously follows all aspects of the provided instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the scene as a 3D game, describes the unusual setting of a floating kitchen, and notes specific, verifiable details like the fires, ropes, and the pink, deflating balloon. The description of the camera movement (pulling away) and the final obscuration by clouds is also a precise account of the video's motion.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, addressing every required element from the instruction:\n*   **Point of View:** It clearly states the POV is a \"third-person 3D game video.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It defines the setting as a \"square wooden kitchen platform\" and the environment as being \"suspended high in a cloudy, grey sky.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It provides specific details about color, material, and shape (e.g., \"square wooden\" platform, \"thick ropes,\" \"large, pink, deflating balloon\").\n*   **Motion and Scene Transition:** It describes the camera motion (\"The view pulls away\") and how the scene ends (\"before the scene is obscured by clouds\").\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the UI elements as \"overlays\" and specifies their content and placement on the screen (recipe cards, score, timer).\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect adherence to the stylistic and content-based rules:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is a single, coherent unit that packs a lot of information without being wordy.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"chaotic,\" \"dangerous\") and uses neutral descriptors (\"on fire,\" \"deflating\").\n*   **No Speculation:** It refrains from using words like \"appears to be\" or \"might be,\" stating only what is visibly present.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** As instructed, it focuses on the environment and scenery, mentioning the character's presence only to establish the POV without going into detail about their actions or appearance.\n*   **No Inferred Purpose:** It does not speculate on the purpose of the setting (e.g., \"a level in a cooking game\"). It simply describes the scene as it is.\n*   **Correct Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown formatting.",
