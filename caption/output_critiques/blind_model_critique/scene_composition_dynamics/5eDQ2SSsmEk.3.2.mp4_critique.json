    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, high-tech environment. The scene features a hand interacting with electronic equipment, including a radio and a screen displaying data. The equipment is characterized by dark metallic surfaces with illuminated buttons and dials, emitting a warm orange glow. The screen shows complex graphics and text, suggesting a technical or control room atmosphere. The lighting is low, creating a moody ambiance with shadows and focused highlights on the devices. The overall color scheme is a mix of dark tones with contrasting bright lights, enhancing the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why it fails to meet the requirements:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Cannot Be Determined:** Without the video, it is impossible to verify if the description of the \"dimly lit, high-tech environment,\" \"radio,\" \"screen displaying data,\" and \"warm orange glow\" is accurate.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption fails to specify the point of view (e.g., first-person, close-up shot), which is a key requirement in the instructions and would be relevant for a scene focusing on a hand interacting with objects.\n*   **Lacks Motion Description:** While it mentions a \"hand interacting,\" it does not describe the specific motion or changes occurring, such as dials turning, buttons being pressed, or data changing on the screen.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several key negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the words **\"moody ambiance\"** and **\"mysterious feel,\"** which are subjective and emotional descriptions.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The phrase **\"suggesting a technical or control room atmosphere\"** is an inference about the purpose or role of the setting, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final sentence, **\"enhancing the technological and slightly mysterious feel of the setting,\"** explains the effect of the color scheme, directly contradicting this rule.\n\nIn summary, while the caption attempts to describe the visual elements, it fails by including subjective interpretations, inferring the setting's purpose, and explaining the impact of visual choices, all of which are explicitly prohibited by the detailed instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor scene with a dimly lit, high-tech environment. A hand is seen interacting with electronic equipment, including a radio and a screen displaying data. The equipment features dark metallic surfaces with illuminated buttons and dials emitting a warm orange glow. The screen displays complex graphics and text.

The point of view is a close-up shot, focusing on the hand's movements as it turns dials and presses buttons, causing changes on the screen.",
