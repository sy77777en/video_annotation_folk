    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor setting with a lively, festive atmosphere. The environment is dimly lit, with warm, ambient lighting from neon signs, including one that reads \"Patrón 2000.\" The decor features colorful streamers hanging from the ceiling, contributing to a celebratory vibe. The walls are adorned with various decorations, enhancing the vibrant setting. The time of day is not explicitly clear due to the indoor lighting.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several core requirements of the instruction. While it correctly identifies some visual elements, it violates key negative constraints regarding tone, speculation, and focus.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**1. Violation of Tone and Objectivity:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Caption:** The caption uses numerous subjective and emotional words, such as \"lively,\" \"festive atmosphere,\" \"celebratory vibe,\" \"vibrant setting,\" \"eclectic and lively ambiance.\" These words describe a feeling or interpretation rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Caption:** Phrases like \"contributing to a celebratory vibe,\" \"enhancing the vibrant setting,\" and \"adding to the eclectic and lively ambiance\" explain the *effect* of the decor, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n**2. Violation of Speculation and Inference:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n*   **Caption:** The final sentence, \"The overall composition suggests a casual, social gathering space,\" is a direct inference about the function and nature of the location, which is explicitly prohibited.\n\n**3. Incompleteness and Lack of Detail:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Provide a concise yet informative description... including the point of view.\"\n*   **Caption:** The caption completely omits the **point of view** (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld), which is a mandatory element.\n*   **Instruction:** \"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe natural elements... or human-made movements.\"\n*   **Caption:** The caption describes a static scene. If there is any movement in the video (e.g., people moving, lights flashing, camera panning), it has been completely ignored.\n*   **Instruction:** \"For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features.\"\n*   **Caption:** The description of the decor is vague. \"Colorful streamers\" and \"various decorations\" lack the specific detail requested (e.g., \"thin, metallic red and gold streamers,\" \"square paper cutouts on the walls\").\n\n**4. Improper Focus:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Caption:** The caption gives a relatively detailed description of the subject's attire (\"wide-brimmed hat, white sunglasses, and layered necklaces\"), which shifts focus away from the setting. The instruction asks for subject placement and context to complement the scene, not for a list of their accessories.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it is interpretive and subjective rather than descriptive and objective. It infers the atmosphere and purpose of the scene, uses emotional language, and omits critical required information like the point of view and any potential motion, while providing more detail on the subject than the setting.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor setting with dim lighting and warm, ambient illumination from neon signs, including one that reads \"Patrón 2000.\" The decor includes thin, metallic red and gold streamers hanging from the ceiling. The walls feature square paper cutouts and other decorations. The scene is captured from a static point of view. A subject is present, positioned centrally, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, white sunglasses, and layered necklaces. The video does not show any noticeable motion or changes within the scene.",
