    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor scene within a room, illuminated for evening or nighttime. A central, gold-colored metal chandelier with multiple lit bulbs encased in cylindrical glass shades dominates the view. The room has light-colored walls, a window showing darkness outside, and a light-colored floor. Furnishings include black and white striped armchairs and a round table with a light-colored surface. Additional lighting is provided by modern, geometric wall-mounted lamps. Animated characters are interacting with the chandelier.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively describes the key elements and action but could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. It correctly identifies the setting, time of day, and central objects like the chandelier and furniture. However, it omits the point of view, which is a required element; for instance, it could be a static medium shot that keeps the entire chandelier and the characters in view. The caption also uses subjective adjectives like \"cozy,\" \"striking,\" and \"stylish,\" which should be replaced with more neutral, descriptive language. For example, instead of a \"cozy living room,\" one could describe it as \"a living room with warm ambient lighting.\" The phrase \"as if experiencing a short-circuit or loose connection\" is speculative and should be removed, simply stating that the chandelier flickers and its lights go out. The description of the action, while accurate, could be more concise by focusing on the effect rather than the narrative of the chase. Finally, if the video included a TV network logo or watermark as an overlay in a corner, the caption fails to mention it, which is a detail the instructions specifically ask to include.",
