    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few areas where it fails to fully adhere to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible scene. The description of the lighting effect—a silhouette created by a bright fire, with a glowing outline and features in shadow—is physically correct and well-articulated. The described motion (flickering fire, turning head) is also clear and logical.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in two key areas as mandated by the instructions:\n\n1.  **Setting:** The instruction requires specifying whether the setting is indoors or outdoors and describing its defining features. The caption uses the vague phrase \"a dark setting,\" which does not fulfill this requirement. It is unclear if this is a campfire in a forest, a bonfire on a beach, or a fireplace in a room.\n2.  **Point of View:** The instruction explicitly asks to indicate the point of view (e.g., static shot, close-up, medium shot). The caption omits this detail entirely.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption adheres well to many rules but violates a few important ones.\n\n**Strengths (Rules Followed):**\n*   **Conciseness and Tone:** It is a concise, single paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Subject Description:** It correctly focuses on the subject's silhouette and placement relative to the scene, avoiding excessive detail as instructed.\n*   **Motion:** It effectively describes motion by mentioning the \"flickering fire\" and how the person \"slowly turns their head.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** It avoids speculative language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Visual Elements:** It describes the color of the flames (\"bright orange and yellow\").\n\n**Weaknesses (Rules Violated):**\n*   **Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The phrase \"provide the primary illumination\" violates this rule by explaining the function of the fire rather than just describing its effect. A more compliant phrasing would be, \"The bright orange and yellow flames on the left illuminate the scene...\"\n*   **Vague Setting:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" failing to specify the indoor/outdoor nature of the setting is a direct violation of the instruction to \"clearly identify\" it.\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The omission of the point of view is another direct violation of a specific requirement.\n*   **Potentially Subjective Adjective:** The word \"warm\" in \"warm, glowing outline\" could be interpreted as an emotional or subjective adjective, which the instructions advise against. While \"warm\" can describe a color temperature, it often carries an emotional connotation. A more neutral alternative might be \"a yellow-orange, glowing outline.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Outdoors at night, a person is silhouetted against a large, flickering fire, possibly a bonfire on a beach. The bright orange and yellow flames on the left illuminate the scene, casting the individual's features into deep shadow while creating a yellow-orange, glowing outline on their profile and hair. The surrounding environment is obscured in darkness. In a medium shot, the person slowly turns their head toward the front as the fire continues to burn.",
