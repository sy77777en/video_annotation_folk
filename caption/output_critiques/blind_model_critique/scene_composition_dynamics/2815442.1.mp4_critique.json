    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a serene outdoor setting featuring a large, calm body of water surrounded by lush greenery. The scene is set during the day under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. The expansive lake is bordered by dense forests and rolling hills, creating a picturesque landscape. The water is a deep blue, contrasting with the vibrant green of the trees. Small islands with clusters of trees are visible within the lake, adding to the natural beauty. The distant mountains provide a majestic backdrop, enhancing the sense of tranquility and vastness in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially good as it accurately captures the main elements of the scene, but it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and the avoidance of interpretive language.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption provides a coherent and plausible description of the scene. It correctly identifies the main components: a body of water, surrounding greenery, islands, and distant mountains. The colors mentioned (deep blue water, green trees, blue sky) are consistent with such a landscape.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Mostly Complete:** The caption successfully includes the point of view (\"drone POV\"), setting (\"outdoor\"), time of day (\"during the day\"), and notable visual elements (lake, forests, hills, islands, mountains).\n*   **Incomplete:** The instructions require a description of motion if present. A drone shot is inherently in motion (e.g., flying forward, panning, ascending). The caption describes a static scene (\"calm body of water\") and omits any mention of camera movement or natural motion like wind in the trees or ripples on the water, which are likely present.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is the area with the most significant issues.\n\n*   **Violation - Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses multiple subjective and emotional words, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   **\"serene\"**: Describes a feeling or mood, not a visual fact.\n    *   **\"picturesque\"**: A subjective judgment of the scene's beauty.\n    *   **\"vibrant\"**: While it can describe color intensity, it often carries a subjective connotation of energy or life.\n    *   **\"natural beauty\"**: A purely subjective assessment.\n    *   **\"majestic\"**: An emotional and subjective description of the mountains.\n    *   **\"tranquility\"**: Describes an abstract feeling, not a visible element.\n\n*   **Violation - Do Not Explain What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** The caption repeatedly infers the purpose or effect of the visual elements, which is a direct violation of the instructions.\n    *   \"...**creating a picturesque landscape.**\" (Explains the result of the composition).\n    *   \"...**adding to the natural beauty.**\" (Explains the function of the islands).\n    *   \"...**provide a majestic backdrop, enhancing the sense of tranquility and vastness in the scene.**\" (This entire phrase explains the role of the mountains and their effect on the viewer's perception).\n\n*   **Minor Issue - Focus on the Scene:** While not explicitly forbidden, starting with \"The video... presents an aerial view\" is slightly less direct than beginning with the description of the scene itself (e.g., \"From a drone's point of view, an outdoor scene unfolds...\"). The instructions favor describing the scene as if the viewer is there, rather than describing the video as an object.\n\n### Summary\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is **not good** because it fails to follow critical negative constraints. While it successfully identifies the core visual components, its heavy reliance on subjective adjectives and interpretive statements directly contradicts the instructions to be objective, avoid emotional language, and not explain the purpose or effect of scene elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a drone's point of view, an outdoor scene unfolds featuring a large body of water surrounded by dense greenery. The scene is set during the day under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. The expansive lake is bordered by forests and rolling hills. The water appears deep blue, contrasting with the green of the trees. Small islands with clusters of trees are visible within the lake. Distant mountains form the backdrop. The drone moves steadily, capturing the landscape from above, with subtle ripples on the water and gentle movement in the trees.",
