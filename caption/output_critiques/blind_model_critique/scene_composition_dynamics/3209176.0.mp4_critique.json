    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor setting within a modern greenhouse or industrial facility, characterized by a high, transparent ceiling made of glass panels supported by a metal framework. The environment is well-lit, with natural light streaming through the ceiling, suggesting daytime. The space is filled with an array of pipes and metal structures, some of which run parallel to the ceiling, contributing to an industrial aesthetic. The walls are lined with large glass windows, and the floor is a smooth, reflective surface. The overall color scheme is a mix of metallic grays and blues, with occasional warm tones from the lighting. The scene remains static, with no significant changes in weather or lighting, maintaining a consistent, structured atmosphere throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few key areas where it fails to fully adhere to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies the materials (glass, metal), structures (panels, framework, pipes), surfaces (smooth, reflective floor), and color palette (metallic grays, blues, warm tones). The description of the lighting (natural light from the ceiling) is also precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one critical piece of information explicitly requested by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions require specifying the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld). The caption fails to mention this, leaving out how the viewer perceives the scene. It describes the scene as \"static,\" but doesn't clarify if this is from a fixed camera position.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows many rules well but violates a few important ones:\n\n**Strengths (What it does well):**\n*   It is a single, concise paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than subjects.\n*   It avoids using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It describes colors, materials, and shapes of notable elements as instructed.\n*   It correctly notes the lack of motion (\"The scene remains static\").\n\n**Weaknesses (Where it deviates from instructions):**\n*   **Avoids Ambiguous Options:** The caption states the setting is a \"modern greenhouse **or** industrial facility.\" The instructions explicitly say to avoid \"ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" It should have committed to one description or described the features without offering a choice.\n*   **Avoids Speculative Statements:** It uses the phrase \"**suggesting** daytime.\" The instructions prohibit speculative language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\" A more direct statement, such as \"The scene is set during the daytime, lit by natural light,\" would be better.\n*   **Avoids Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"contributing to an industrial **aesthetic**\" and \"maintaining a consistent, structured **atmosphere**.\" These terms are interpretative and subjective, explaining the *feel* of the scene, which the instructions advise against. It should stick to describing only what is visibly present.",
