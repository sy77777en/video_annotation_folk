    "pre_caption": "The scene is set on a dark, wet floor composed of large, uneven flagstones. A single, green olive rests in the center of the frame on the wet surface. In the background, a rough, dark grey concrete step runs horizontally across the shot. To the left, on the floor, sits a black object with exposed wires, next to which is a small, light grey rectangular block. The area behind the step is dimly lit and contains indistinct brown shapes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres closely to the provided instructions, but it has one minor omission.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. Every element mentioned is present in the video and described correctly.\n*   \"dark, wet floor composed of large, uneven flagstones\": This perfectly describes the ground surface.\n*   \"single, green olive rests in the center\": This is accurate in terms of the object, its color, and its placement.\n*   \"rough, dark grey concrete step\": This correctly identifies the material, color, and texture of the step in the background.\n*   \"black object with exposed wires\" and \"small, light grey rectangular block\": These descriptions are precise and accurately capture the objects on the left.\n*   \"indistinct brown shapes\": This is a good, non-speculative way to describe the out-of-focus area in the far background.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, covering the setting, environment, and key visual elements as requested. However, it omits one detail required by the instructions:\n*   **Missing Element:** The caption does not mention the **point of view**. The instruction states, \"If relevant, indicate the **point of view**...\" In this case, describing it as a static, low-angle shot would have been relevant and would have made the description fully complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption excels at following the specific constraints:\n*   It successfully combines details into a single, coherent paragraph without referring to specific frames.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" and focuses on the scene's setting and scenery.\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., it uses \"dark\" and \"wet\" descriptively, not to create a mood).\n*   It correctly avoids speculation (e.g., \"indistinct brown shapes\" instead of guessing what they are).\n*   It does not infer the purpose of the setting or explain what the scene emphasizes.\n*   It correctly identifies that there are no overlays, motion, or scene transitions, and therefore does not mention them.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThis is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. Its accuracy and adherence to the negative constraints are nearly perfect. The only area for improvement is the inclusion of the point of view to make it fully compliant with all aspects of the prompt.",
