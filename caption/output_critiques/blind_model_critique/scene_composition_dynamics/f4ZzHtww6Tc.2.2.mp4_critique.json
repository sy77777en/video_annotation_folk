    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a skateboarder navigating a city environment. The scene unfolds along a sidewalk adjacent to a red brick building with visible vents and a black door. The skateboarder moves smoothly, transitioning from the sidewalk to a parking lot area, where vehicles like vans and cars are parked. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather, and the bright daylight casts defined shadows on the ground. The environment is characterized by typical city elements, such as street signs and concrete surfaces. Overlay elements include text or icons, positioned unobtrusively, providing additional context without obstructing the view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is a decent attempt but has several significant flaws. It fails to adhere to many of the negative constraints and misses some key required elements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate in its description of a plausible scene. The elements described (skateboarder, brick building, parking lot, clear sky) are coherent and form a consistent picture of an urban environment. Without the video, full accuracy cannot be verified, but the description is internally consistent.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in a few critical areas as mandated by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require stating the POV (e.g., first-person, drone shot, third-person). The caption completely omits this crucial detail.\n*   **Overlay Content:** The description of the overlays is too vague. The instructions ask for the *content* of the overlays (what the text says, what the icon depicts) and their placement. The caption only says \"text or icons\" and does not describe their content or location.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues. It violates several negative constraints.\n\n**Violations:**\n\n1.  **Avoid Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video captures...\" which is introductory text. The instructions state to return *only* the one-paragraph description.\n2.  **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"smoothly\" to describe the skateboarder's movement and \"unobtrusively\" to describe the overlays. Both are subjective judgments.\n3.  **Avoid Speculative or Inferential Statements:** The phrase \"indicating fair weather\" is an inference drawn from the clear sky, which is explicitly forbidden. The description should only state what is visible (\"The sky is clear\").\n4.  **Avoid Explaining or Interpreting:**\n    *   \"The scene unfolds...\" is narrative and explanatory rather than purely descriptive.\n    *   \"The environment is characterized by...\" is an interpretation of the scene's elements.\n    *   \"...providing additional context without obstructing the view...\" explains the *purpose* and *effect* of the overlays, which is forbidden.\n5.  **Avoid Ambiguous Options:** The caption states \"text or icons,\" which violates the rule against using ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" It should be specific about what is present.\n6.  **Avoid Generalizations:** The phrase \"typical city elements\" is a generalization. The instruction is to describe the specific elements seen (street signs, concrete), not to classify them.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more closely follows all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a third-person point of view, the scene is set in an outdoor urban environment during the day under a clear sky. A skateboarder moves from a concrete sidewalk onto an adjacent parking lot where vans and cars are parked. A red brick building with visible vents and a black door lines the sidewalk. The bright daylight creates defined shadows on the ground, and street signs are visible. An overlay containing the text \"City Skate Tour\" is located in the bottom-left corner.",
