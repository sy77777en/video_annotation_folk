    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, underwater environment resembling a forest. Tall, stalk-like structures with flat, pinkish, disc-shaped tops rise from a sandy seabed. The stalks have a green, mossy texture and are illuminated by various forms of bioluminescence, including glowing green and purple spots, and strings of bright teal lights that wrap around them. Clusters of small, glowing white particles drift in the dark, greenish water. The view is framed by a dark orange border, suggesting a helmet or viewport, and a gloved orange and black hand is visible in the lower right. A faint text overlay is present in the bottom left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **very good** but has one minor area for improvement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the caption accurately reflects the video's content, it is excellent. It provides a rich, specific, and verifiable description of the scene. Details like \"flat, pinkish, disc-shaped tops,\" \"green, mossy texture,\" and \"strings of bright teal lights\" create a clear and precise mental image.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete and successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Clearly described as a \"dark, underwater environment resembling a forest\" with a \"sandy seabed.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The stalk-like structures, various forms of bioluminescence, and drifting particles are all described with specific details regarding their color, shape, and texture.\n*   **Subjects:** The \"gloved orange and black hand\" is included concisely, providing context without excessive detail.\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies both the \"dark orange border\" and the \"faint text overlay,\" specifying their location as instructed.\n*   **Motion:** It effectively describes the camera's movement (\"moves through\") and the environmental motion (\"particles drift\").\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Formatting and Language:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It correctly avoids forbidden words (\"image,\" \"frame\"), emotional adjectives, and subjective statements.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description prioritizes the setting and environment over the subject, as instructed.\n*   **Objective Detail:** It excels at describing elements by their physical attributes (color, material, shape, texture) rather than their purpose or emotional impact.\n*   **Handling of Overlays:** It correctly distinguishes scene elements from overlays, describing the framing border and text as separate components.\n\n**Area for Minor Improvement:**\n*   **Avoiding Inference:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The phrase \"**suggesting a helmet or viewport**\" is an inference about the function of the orange border. While it is a very logical conclusion, it technically violates the rule. A stricter adherence would be to describe it purely visually, for example: \"The view is framed by a dark orange border.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is of high quality and demonstrates a strong understanding of the complex instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-written. The only point of critique is a minor inferential statement that could be rephrased for perfect adherence to the strict, objective-only rule.",
