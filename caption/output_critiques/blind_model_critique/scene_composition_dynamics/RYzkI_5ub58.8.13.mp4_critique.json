    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** A single, translucent jellyfish floats in a dark, uniform aquatic environment. The creature glows with a cyan light and has a thin, bell-shaped body containing intricate, folded structures within. It drifts and pulses gently, its gelatinous form subtly changing shape as it moves through the water.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and follows the provided instructions with a high degree of precision.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is factually accurate for a video of a bioluminescent jellyfish. The terms used—\"translucent,\" \"bell-shaped,\" \"cyan light,\" \"pulses gently,\" and \"gelatinous form\"—are precise and correctly describe the typical appearance and movement of such a creature.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene. It establishes the setting (\"dark, uniform aquatic environment\"), identifies the sole subject (\"a single...jellyfish\"), describes its key visual attributes (\"glows with a cyan light,\" \"thin, bell-shaped body,\" \"intricate, folded structures\"), and details its motion (\"drifts and pulses gently,\" \"subtly changing shape\"). It successfully paints a full picture for the viewer.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet packed with essential information.\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It clearly defines the setting as a \"dark, uniform aquatic environment,\" which is specific and descriptive without being speculative.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It excels at describing the jellyfish's color (\"cyan light\"), material/texture (\"translucent,\" \"gelatinous\"), shape (\"thin, bell-shaped\"), and distinguishing features (\"intricate, folded structures\").\n*   **Motion:** The description of movement (\"floats,\" \"drifts and pulses gently,\" \"changing shape as it moves\") is clear and dynamic, confirming it describes a video, not a static image.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"mysterious\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears to be,\" \"it might be\").\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the scenery and the visual characteristics of the subject, rather than inferring a story or purpose.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions state to mention POV \"if relevant.\" For a simple, observational shot like this, the POV is not a defining characteristic (unlike a drone or dashcam shot), so its omission is appropriate and keeps the caption focused.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph, as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and complete, capturing the essence of the video in simple, natural language without adding any unnecessary or forbidden elements. It demonstrates a clear understanding of every rule provided.",
