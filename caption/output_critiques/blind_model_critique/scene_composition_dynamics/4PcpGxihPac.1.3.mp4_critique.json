    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** A dark, wooded area at night is completely saturated in a deep red light. A bright, horizontal red lens flare with several circular bokeh effects stretches across the center of the view. In the background, the silhouettes of tree trunks and undergrowth are faintly discernible. A pale, mask-like face is partially visible in the center, nestled amongst the trees and obscured by the intense red haze.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and masterfully adheres to the complex set of instructions. It is a model example of how to follow the provided guidelines.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a dark, wooded area at night, the overwhelming deep red light, and the faint silhouettes of trees. The description of the \"bright, horizontal red lens flare with several circular bokeh effects\" is precise and true to the visual. The characterization of the central subject as a \"pale, mask-like face\" is also perfectly accurate, describing its appearance without making unverified assumptions.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive, covering all essential visual information. It establishes the overall environment, time of day, dominant color scheme, specific optical effects (lens flare), background details, and the primary subject. It successfully paints a full picture of the static scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is both concise and informative.\n    *   **Focus on Setting:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and atmosphere, integrating the subject (\"face\") as an element within the scene rather than the sole focus.\n    *   **Descriptive Language:** It uses precise, objective language to describe visual elements (e.g., \"horizontal,\" \"circular bokeh,\" \"silhouettes,\" \"pale\").\n    *   **Avoidance of Prohibited Elements:**\n        *   It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"scary,\" \"eerie\").\n        *   It avoids speculation by using the descriptive term \"mask-like\" instead of stating it *is* a mask or a person.\n        *   It does not infer the scene's purpose or mention what is being emphasized.\n        *   It correctly omits any reference to \"frames\" or \"images\" and does not describe motion, as the scene is static.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is exceptionally well-crafted. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the instructions by providing a description that is accurate, detailed, and strictly compliant with all positive and negative constraints.",
