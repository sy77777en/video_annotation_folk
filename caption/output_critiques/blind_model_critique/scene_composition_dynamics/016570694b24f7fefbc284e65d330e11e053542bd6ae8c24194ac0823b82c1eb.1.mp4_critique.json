    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a kitchen or café, featuring a glass mug filled with a layered coffee drink. The mug is placed on a dark countertop, and the drink displays distinct layers of milk and coffee, topped with frothy foam. The glass has a small red emblem on its side. The background includes a blurred view of shelves or cabinets, suggesting a warm, cozy environment. The lighting is soft, indicating an ambient indoor light source, with no specific time of day discernible. The scene remains focused on the drink, with a slight change in focus towards the end, maintaining the overall warm and inviting atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is a good attempt but has several significant errors when measured against the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the rules:\n\n### Strengths:\n*   **Core Description:** The caption accurately identifies the main subject (a layered coffee drink in a glass mug) and its key features (layers of milk and coffee, frothy foam, red emblem).\n*   **Setting Elements:** It correctly describes the setting as indoors, with a dark countertop and a blurred background of shelves or cabinets.\n*   **Motion:** It successfully notes the \"slight change in focus,\" which is a key part of describing motion or changes in the scene.\n*   **Structure:** The description is organized logically, moving from the general setting to the specific object and its details.\n\n### Areas for Improvement / Rule Violations:\n1.  **Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly forbids speculative statements like \"likely\" and ambiguous options like \"A or B.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption states, \"**likely** a kitchen **or** café.\" This is both speculative and an ambiguous \"A or B\" choice. It should only describe what is visible (e.g., \"an indoor setting with a countertop\").\n\n2.  **Subjective and Emotional Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption uses phrases like \"**warm, cozy** environment\" and \"**warm and inviting** atmosphere.\" These are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood, not factual descriptions.\n\n3.  **Inferring and Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\" and to avoid phrases that suggest intent, like \"suggesting.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The phrases \"**suggesting** a warm, cozy environment\" and \"**maintaining** the overall warm and inviting atmosphere\" explain the *effect* or *purpose* of the visual elements, which is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Missing Point of View (POV):** The instruction requires specifying the point of view.\n    *   **Violation:** The caption completely omits the POV. Based on the description, it is a **close-up shot**, which is a critical detail for understanding the scene's composition.\n\n### Revised Caption Following All Instructions:\n\nFrom a close-up point of view, an indoor scene features a glass mug with a small red emblem on its side, resting on a dark countertop. The mug contains a layered drink with a dark coffee base, a middle layer of milk, and a top layer of white foam. In the blurred background, shelves or cabinets are visible. The scene is lit by a soft, ambient light, and the time of day is not discernible. The focus shifts slightly on the mug throughout the shot.",
