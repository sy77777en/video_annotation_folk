    "pre_caption": "The video is set outdoors at night, featuring a dimly lit environment with a backdrop of dark foliage. The scene captures two individuals standing close together, partially illuminated by a soft light source, which highlights their faces against the shadowy surroundings. The lighting creates a contrast between the subjects and the dark, leafy background, adding depth to the scene. The individuals are positioned in a way that suggests interaction, with their expressions visible due to the subtle lighting. The overall atmosphere is calm and quiet, with the natural elements of the night and the surrounding greenery providing a serene setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Violation of Focus:** The instructions state, \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\" The caption does the opposite, dedicating most of its content to the two individuals, their proximity, the light on their faces, and their implied interaction.\n*   **Inclusion of Subjective and Emotional Language:** The caption violates the rule to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" Words like **\"calm,\" \"quiet,\"** and **\"serene\"** describe a mood or atmosphere, which is subjective.\n*   **Inclusion of Speculative Statements:** The caption uses the phrase **\"suggests interaction,\"** which is a speculative interpretation of the subjects' relationship. The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements and inferences.\n*   **Explaining Cinematic Effects:** The caption explains what the scene emphasizes or highlights, which is forbidden. Phrases like **\"highlights their faces\"** and **\"adding depth to the scene\"** analyze the function of the lighting rather than simply describing the scene itself.\n*   **Missing Key Information:** The caption omits several required details:\n    *   **Point of View:** It does not specify the camera's perspective (e.g., eye-level, close-up, medium shot).\n    *   **Motion:** It describes a static scene and fails to mention any movement, whether from the subjects or the environment (like wind in the foliage).\n    *   **Specific Details:** The description of the \"dark foliage\" is generic and lacks details about color, shape, or type of plant, as requested for notable visual elements.\n\nIn summary, the caption focuses incorrectly on interpreting the subjects and the scene's mood, while omitting required objective details about the point of view, motion, and specific environmental features.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is set outdoors at night, showcasing a dimly lit environment with a backdrop of dense, dark foliage. The camera captures the scene from an eye-level perspective, revealing the intricate shapes and textures of the leaves. A soft light source partially illuminates the area, creating a stark contrast between the illuminated elements and the shadowy surroundings. The scene is static, with no visible movement from the subjects, but a gentle breeze rustles the leaves, adding subtle motion to the foliage. The overall setting is characterized by the natural elements of the night and the surrounding greenery.",
