    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an urban setting during a cloudy day, featuring a highway elevated above a cityscape. The scene includes modern buildings with illuminated windows lining the road, suggesting an active city environment. The highway is bordered by streetlights and sparse trees, with a body of water visible in the distance. The road is smooth and wide, accommodating a large, green vehicle that appears to be in motion, emphasizing the dynamic nature of the scene. Overlays include a white arrow pointing forward, numerical indicators like \"067/650 Passengers\" and \"203,\" and text such as \"Pier 59,\" which are positioned at the top and bottom of the scene, providing additional context without being part of the physical environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is a decent attempt but contains several significant violations of the instructions. While it captures some key visual elements, it fails on crucial points of style, objectivity, and completeness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description of the physical scene (elevated highway, cityscape, buildings, green vehicle, body of water) and the content of the overlays (\"067/650 Passengers,\" \"Pier 59,\" etc.) appear to be accurate based on the information provided. The details are consistent with each other.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in one major area:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require stating the point of view (e.g., first-person, dashcam) and how it influences perception. The description of a moving vehicle on a highway strongly suggests a first-person or dashcam POV, which is a critical piece of context that has been omitted. The motion of the camera itself is not described, only that of another vehicle.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n*   **Violation 1: Using Interpretive Language.**\n    *   **Caption:** \"...suggesting an active city environment.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" This phrase interprets the meaning of the illuminated windows rather than just describing them.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Using Speculative Language.**\n    *   **Caption:** \"...a large, green vehicle that *appears* to be in motion...\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The word \"appears\" is explicitly forbidden. The motion should be stated as a fact if it is occurring.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Explaining Emphasis.**\n    *   **Caption:** \"...*emphasizing* the dynamic nature of the scene.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" This phrase explains the artistic or narrative effect of the motion, which is a direct violation.\n\n*   **Violation 4: Explaining the Function of Elements.**\n    *   **Caption:** \"...providing additional context without being part of the physical environment.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** The goal is to describe what is visible, not explain the purpose of the elements. Simply stating that they are overlays positioned at the top and bottom is sufficient.\n\n*   **Violation 5: Using Introductory Phrases.**\n    *   **Caption:** \"The video depicts...\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" While not explicitly forbidden, \"The video depicts\" is a meta-description that goes against the spirit of describing the scene directly and immersively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it repeatedly violates the core negative constraints of the instructions. It engages in interpretation, speculation, and explanation of emphasis, all of which were explicitly forbidden. It also misses the crucial requirement of identifying the point of view.\n\nA corrected version adhering strictly to the instructions would look like this:\n\n**From a first-person point of view, the scene moves forward along a wide, smooth highway elevated above an urban cityscape on a cloudy day. Modern buildings with illuminated windows, streetlights, and sparse trees line the road. In the distance, a body of water is visible. A large, green vehicle is in motion on the highway. Overlays are present at the top and bottom of the scene, including a white forward-pointing arrow, the numerical indicators \"067/650 Passengers\" and \"203,\" and the text \"Pier 59.\"**",
