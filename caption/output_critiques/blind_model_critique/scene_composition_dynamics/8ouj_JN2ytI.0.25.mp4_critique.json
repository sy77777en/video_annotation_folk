To the left, a building is obscured by thick plumes of gray smoke and bright orange fire. The building on the right, possibly made of stone, is illuminated by warm, golden light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The car is in motion, moving away from the fiery scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the crucial dashcam point of view, which situates the viewer inside a moving vehicle and is confirmed by a timestamp overlay in the bottom-right corner. The description incorrectly speculates that the golden light suggests a sunrise or sunset; the video clearly shows this illumination is the intense, flickering light from the fire reflecting off the wet asphalt and the facades of adjacent concrete buildings. The caption's description of the fire is too simplistic, failing to note that the bright orange flames are consuming the lower three stories of a modern office building, causing black smoke to billow into the sky, not just gray plumes. Additionally, the \"black explosion debris\" is not just generic debris but a specific scattering of twisted rebar, shattered glass, and concrete fragments littering the right lane. The description of the building as \"possibly made of stone\" is an inaccurate guess, as the visible texture is that of precast concrete panels, some of which have been scorched black near the blaze.",

The intense, flickering light from the fire reflects off the wet asphalt and the facades of adjacent concrete buildings. On the right, the building, made of precast concrete panels, some scorched black near the blaze, is illuminated by the fire's glow. The right lane is littered with black explosion debris, including twisted rebar, shattered glass, and concrete fragments, as the car moves away from the fiery scene.",
