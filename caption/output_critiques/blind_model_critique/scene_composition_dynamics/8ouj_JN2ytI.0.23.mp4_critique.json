    "pre_caption": "An outdoor football stadium is filled with a large crowd of spectators, many of whom are wearing yellow, creating a dense, colorful backdrop in the stands. On the green grass field, marked with white yard lines, a football game is in progress. A player in a yellow and black uniform with the number 81 on his jersey runs with the ball. In the foreground, another player in a yellow jersey with the number 15 is on the ground, having just tackled an opposing player in a light blue and white uniform. Other players from both teams are scattered across the field in various states of motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the general setting, but it lacks crucial details that would be prominent in the video. It omits any mention of on-screen overlays, such as a score bug and game clock, which are visible in the top-left corner. The description of the point of view is speculative; it should be described more directly as a low-angle, on-field tracking shot that follows the ball carrier, with its shaky motion immersing the viewer in the action. The environment is described too generically; the video clearly shows it is a bright, sunny day, with long shadows cast across the turf from the players and the stadium structure. Furthermore, a large digital scoreboard displaying replays is visible in the background behind one of the end zones, and prominent advertising banners line the stadium walls, none of which are mentioned. While the caption notes the player's number, it fails to mention the team names or logos visible on the uniforms and helmets, which are clear in the footage. The description of the crowd as a \"dense, colorful backdrop\" is also an understatement, as the video shows specific sections of fans actively waving yellow towels and jumping, adding dynamic motion to the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a vibrant outdoor football stadium, a large crowd of spectators, many wearing yellow and actively waving towels, creates a dynamic and lively backdrop. The game unfolds on a sunlit field, with long shadows stretching across the turf. A low-angle, on-field tracking shot follows a player in a yellow and black uniform, number 81, as he runs with the ball, immersing the viewer in the action with its shaky motion. Nearby, a player in a yellow jersey, number 15, is on the ground after tackling an opponent in a light blue and white uniform. The top-left corner of the screen displays a score bug and game clock, providing real-time updates. In the background, a large digital scoreboard shows replays, while advertising banners line the stadium walls.
