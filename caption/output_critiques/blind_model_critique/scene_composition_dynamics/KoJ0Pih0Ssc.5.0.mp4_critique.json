    "pre_caption": "In a bright, sunlit outdoor setting, a long, curving row of rusty, brown metal tank traps sits on a wide strip of sandy ground. To the left, a tall, cylindrical concrete watchtower stands next to a high concrete wall. In the background, beyond the wall, are several gray, multi-story apartment buildings. A white chain-link fence runs parallel to the tank traps on the right.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very closely follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies all major elements: the \"rusty, brown metal tank traps,\" the \"cylindrical concrete watchtower,\" the \"high concrete wall,\" the \"gray, multi-story apartment buildings,\" and the \"white chain-link fence.\"\n*   The descriptions of color, material, and shape for each element are precise.\n*   The placement of objects (\"To the left,\" \"In the background,\" \"on the right\") is correct.\n*   It accurately describes the overlay's color, shape, text content, and position.\n*   The description of the environment as a \"bright, sunlit outdoor setting\" on \"sandy ground\" is spot-on.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, but with one minor omission.\n*   **What it does well:** It successfully covers the setting, time of day (implied by \"bright, sunlit\"), notable visual elements, and the overlay. Crucially, it notes the one significant change in the video by stating the overlay \"appears,\" which correctly implies it was not present for the entire duration.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The instructions ask to \"indicate the point of view\" if relevant. The caption does not mention that this is a static, eye-level shot. Adding this detail would make it fully complete.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption demonstrates outstanding adherence to the rules.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   It successfully combines details from the video without referring to specific frames (e.g., using \"appears\" instead of \"in the second frame\").\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It uses objective, descriptive language (\"rusty,\" \"cylindrical,\" \"gray\") and avoids emotional or subjective words.\n*   It avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"it seems\") and does not infer the purpose of the scene (e.g., it doesn't call it a border or a historical site).\n*   It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay\" and describes its content and placement as instructed.\n*   The language is simple, natural, and clear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, nearly complete, and follows the complex set of negative and positive constraints almost perfectly. Its only room for improvement is the minor addition of the point of view to be 100% compliant with the instructions.",
