    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within an elegant restaurant featuring large glass windows. The environment is characterized by classic decor, including dark green curtains and white tablecloths on dining tables, some of which have candles. The scene captures a moment of dynamic motion as a person in formal attire crashes through a glass window, causing shards to scatter. The lighting suggests it is daytime, with natural light illuminating the interior. The weather outside appears to be snowy, as indicated by the snow visible through the windows. Overlay elements include a watermark in the bottom left corner, labeled \"MOVIECLIPS,\" which is not part of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in its overall structure and inclusion of key details, but it fails to adhere to several specific and important negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the setting (restaurant), key objects (curtains, tables, candles), a central action (person crashing through a window), the time of day (daytime), weather (snowy), and an overlay (watermark).\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete, successfully covering many of the required elements:\n\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It clearly states the setting is an \"indoor... elegant restaurant\" and describes its decor.\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** It mentions \"daytime\" and \"snowy\" conditions.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements & Overlays:** It describes the curtains, tablecloths, and the \"MOVIECLIPS\" watermark.\n*   **Motion:** It effectively describes the \"dynamic motion\" of a person crashing through the glass.\n\nHowever, it is missing one key element required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View:** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, tracking shot), which the instructions ask for if relevant.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues. It violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n**Violations:**\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses \"elegant\" to describe the restaurant and \"classic\" to describe the decor. These are subjective interpretations of the scene's style.\n2.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction states, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The caption violates this rule twice:\n    *   \"The lighting **suggests** it is daytime...\"\n    *   \"The weather outside **appears to be** snowy...\"\n    Instead of inferring, the caption should state what is directly visible (e.g., \"Daytime natural light illuminates the interior,\" and \"Snow is visible outside the windows.\").\n3.  **Explaining Reasoning:** The phrase \"...as indicated by the snow visible through the windows\" explains *how* the conclusion about the weather was reached. The instructions implicitly discourage this by asking for a direct description of what is visible, not an explanation of the deduction process.\n\n**Areas of Adherence:**\n\n*   The caption correctly combines details into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It correctly identifies the watermark as an \"overlay\" that is \"not part of the scene.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery, describing the subject with minimal, context-appropriate detail (\"a person in formal attire\").\n*   It does not infer the role of the scene or explain what it emphasizes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a good first draft that captures the essence of the scene. However, to be considered \"good\" according to the strict rules provided, it needs significant revision to eliminate subjective adjectives and speculative phrasing. By making the language more direct and objective, it would fully align with the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor setting in a restaurant with large glass windows.
