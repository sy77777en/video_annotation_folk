    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor athletic stadium during a track event, likely a championship, as indicated by the signage. The setting is a large, modern arena with tiered seating filled with spectators. The track is a standard red running surface with marked lanes. The time of day is likely daytime, as the stadium is well-lit, though artificial lighting may also be present. The weather is clear, with no visible signs of rain or adverse conditions. The scene includes athletes in motion, running along the track, with officials and equipment visible near the sidelines. The environment is vibrant, with colorful banners and digital screens displaying event information, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere of the competition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on an imagined video of a 100-meter sprint final at a major evening athletics event.\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the general setting but lacks specificity and includes speculative and subjective language contrary to the instructions. It completely omits the point of view and camera motion; the video I imagined uses a mix of a high-angle wide shot establishing the stadium at dusk, followed by a low-angle tracking shot that pans rapidly with the runners, and concludes with a slow-motion replay of the finish. The caption speculates with \"likely daytime\" and \"artificial lighting may also be present,\" whereas the video clearly shows a night event under bright stadium lights against a dark sky. The description of a \"standard red running surface\" is inaccurate for the imagined video, which features a modern blue track. A significant omission is the lack of any mention of broadcast overlays, such as the persistent on-screen graphic at the bottom displaying a running clock, the athletes' names, and their country flags, as well as a network logo in the top-right corner. The phrase \"likely a championship\" should be replaced with a direct description of the visible signage, such as \"banners for the 'World Athletics Final'.\" Lastly, the use of subjective words like \"vibrant\" and \"dynamic atmosphere\" should be replaced by describing the concrete elements that create this impression, such as the packed stands and the flash of cameras from the crowd as the runners cross the finish line.",
