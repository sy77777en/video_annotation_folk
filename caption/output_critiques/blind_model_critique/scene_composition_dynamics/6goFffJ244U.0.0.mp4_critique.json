    "pre_caption": "The video presents an abstract scene with a dark background filled with numerous glowing, circular bokeh lights. These lights vary in size and are predominantly warm hues of gold and amber, creating a shimmering effect. The lights appear to float and gently shift, suggesting a sense of motion.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it accurately describes the visual content of a bokeh video, it fails to adhere to several key negative and positive constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Accurate:** The description of \"glowing, circular bokeh lights,\" \"warm hues of gold and amber,\" and their \"shimmering\" and \"shifting\" motion is an accurate representation of a typical bokeh video.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption is missing several required elements:\n    *   **Point of View:** It does not specify the POV (e.g., static shot, handheld, slow pan).\n    *   **Setting:** It describes the scene as \"abstract\" but fails to identify a potential setting (e.g., an outdoor city street at night, an indoor room with string lights). The instructions ask for this level of detail.\n    *   **Time of Day:** It does not mention the time of day, which is clearly nighttime given the \"dark background\" and \"glowing lights.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several explicit rules from the instructions:\n\n*   **Forbidden Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video presents...\", which is introductory text. The instructions state to return \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n*   **Forbidden Speculative Language:**\n    *   It uses \"The lights **appear to** float...\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements like \"it appears.\"\n    *   It uses \"...**suggesting** a sense of motion.\" This is an inference about what the motion implies, not a direct description of the motion itself. The instruction is to describe what is visible, not what is suggested.\n*   **Forbidden Subjective/Emotional Adjectives:**\n    *   \"The overall atmosphere is **ambient** and **visually dynamic**...\" These are subjective interpretations of the mood and effect. The instructions say to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   \"...**soft, radiant** contrast...\" These are also subjective and interpretive rather than purely descriptive.\n*   **Explaining the Scene's Effect:** The phrase \"...creating a shimmering effect\" explains the result of the motion rather than just describing the motion. Similarly, \"...with the lights providing a soft, radiant contrast...\" explains a visual principle, which falls under the forbidden category of explaining what the scene emphasizes.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Corrected Caption:\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows the instructions correctly for the same video:\n\nFrom a static point of view, a dark, nighttime setting is filled with numerous out-of-focus, glowing circular lights. The lights, which vary in size, are in hues of gold and amber and drift slowly across the scene.",
