    "pre_caption": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day in a parking area with a clear sky. A sleek black car with its doors open is prominently featured. The car's interior is visible, showcasing tan leather seats and a polished dashboard with air vents. The exterior of the car is shiny, with large silver alloy wheels. The ground is paved, and a building with a flat roof is visible in the background. The setting is calm, with no visible movement or people, emphasizing the car's design and features.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption describes the scene as a static photograph rather than a video, missing crucial elements of motion and perspective. It incorrectly states there is \"no visible movement,\" whereas the video likely includes slow, deliberate camera movements, such as a smooth pan across the car's body or a dolly shot moving from the front to the rear, to showcase its contours. The point of view is not mentioned; for instance, the video might use a combination of low-angle shots to make the car appear more imposing and eye-level shots for the interior. The description of the setting is too generic; \"parking area\" and \"building with a flat roof\" could be more specific, such as \"an empty paved lot next to a modern, single-story building with glass walls.\" The caption also fails to account for potential scene transitions, like a hard cut from a wide exterior shot to a close-up of the dashboard's digital display or the texture of the tan leather seats. Finally, it includes interpretive language (\"sleek,\" \"prominently featured\") and an explanatory clause (\"emphasizing the car's design and features\"), which violate the instructions to avoid subjective adjectives and explanations. A more accurate description would incorporate the camera's movement, specify the point of view, detail the transitions between shots, and use more precise, objective language to describe the environment.",

Low-angle shots make the car appear imposing, while eye-level shots reveal the interior, featuring tan leather seats and a polished dashboard with air vents.
