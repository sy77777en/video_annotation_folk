    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor setting within a warmly lit restaurant, characterized by intricate, circular wooden archways with ornate carvings. The environment is bustling, with blurred figures in the background suggesting movement and activity. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting a cozy glow over the scene. A table is prominently featured in the foreground, set with a neatly folded napkin and simple tableware. The overall atmosphere is inviting, with rich, warm colors and detailed decor contributing to a sense of elegance and cultural richness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption captures the general ambiance of the indoor location but misses several key objective details and includes prohibited subjective language. It fails to specify the first-person point of view, which places the viewer directly at the foreground table looking into the room. The description of \"simple tableware\" is imprecise; the table is set with a single white ceramic plate, a silver fork, and a tall, empty wine glass on a dark wood surface. While the \"circular wooden archways\" are mentioned, their material is more specifically a dark, polished mahogany with detailed, repeating geometric carvings characteristic of Moorish design. The \"warmly lit\" environment is created by multiple brass-colored hanging lanterns with filigree patterns, which cast soft, web-like shadows on the surrounding terracotta-tiled floor. The caption also omits a subtle, semi-transparent watermark of a chef's hat icon located in the bottom-right corner. Finally, the use of interpretive words like \"inviting,\" \"elegance,\" and \"cultural richness\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.",
