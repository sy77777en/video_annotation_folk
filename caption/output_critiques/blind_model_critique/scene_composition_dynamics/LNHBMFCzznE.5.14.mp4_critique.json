    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to meet several key requirements of the instructions, particularly regarding completeness and adherence to negative constraints.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The descriptions of the physical elements like the \"red carpet,\" the \"large screen,\" and the \"abstract, geometric pattern\" are factually accurate and descriptive.\n*   However, the phrase \"focusing attention on the central area\" is an interpretation of the lighting's effect, not a direct description of the scene. This violates the instruction to \"not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" A more compliant description would be \"The central area of the stage is brightly lit.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several mandatory details:\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to describe the point of view (e.g., a static wide shot, a medium shot from the audience's perspective).\n*   **Motion:** It describes a static scene (\"a woman is standing\"). A video is a time-based medium, and the caption does not mention any movement, such as the woman's actions, changes in the on-screen pattern, or camera movement (pan, zoom, tilt). This is a significant omission.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption violates several specific instructions:\n*   **Violation:** It explicitly breaks the rule, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights,\" by stating that the lighting is \"focusing attention on the central area.\"\n*   **Violation:** It uses the subjective adjective \"vibrant.\" While minor, the instructions ask to avoid such words. \"Bright red\" would be a more objective alternative.\n*   **Omission:** It fails to include the required **point of view** and any description of **motion or changes**, which are critical for describing a video.",
