    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed instructions. It is accurate, concise, and descriptive, capturing the essential elements of the video in a neutral, objective tone.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the visual style as a \"black-and-white, hand-drawn animation\" is precise.\n*   The environment is accurately described as a \"stark white, undefined space\" with a \"light gray perspective grid.\"\n*   The subject (\"stylized, fox-like creature\"), its actions (\"unfurls and moves through the air\"), the object it holds (\"key-like object\"), and the resulting visual effect (\"trail of small, sketched, bubble-like shapes\") are all correctly identified and described.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Setting & Environment:** The caption effectively establishes the abstract setting and its key feature (the grid).\n*   **Visual Elements:** It correctly notes the color scheme (\"black-and-white,\" \"light gray\") and the style (\"hand-drawn,\" \"sketched\").\n*   **Subjects & Motion:** The subject's appearance and entire sequence of motion are described logically and clearly, from its initial state to its final landing.\n*   **Point of View:** The only minor omission is the explicit mention of the point of view (e.g., a static, third-person perspective). However, for a simple animation like this, its absence does not detract from the clarity of the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is contained within a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"graceful\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"it might be\"). Using \"fox-like\" and \"key-like\" is an appropriate descriptive comparison, not a speculative guess.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and scenery before detailing the subject's actions, as instructed.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not infer the purpose of the scene or explain what it emphasizes.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example of following complex instructions to produce a clear, accurate, and objective video description. It demonstrates a strong understanding of all constraints and requirements.",
