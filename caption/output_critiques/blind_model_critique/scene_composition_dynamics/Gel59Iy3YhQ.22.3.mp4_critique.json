    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented as footage on a CRT monitor, characterized by a greenish tint and visible scan lines. The footage captures an indoor room with light-colored walls and a wooden shelf in the background. A woman sits at a table in the foreground, where a white disposable cup is placed. An overlay in the top right corner displays white text on a black background, including \"MT-ROOM 3,\" an identification number, a running timecode around 19:25, and the date \"18/06/94.\" Yellow subtitles with dialogue are present at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. It is accurate, concise, and descriptive.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the CRT monitor effect, the indoor setting, the subject's placement, the props, and the specific content of the overlays (text, timecode, date, and subtitles). Every detail mentioned appears to be a direct and factual observation.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very thorough, but there are a few minor details that could be added for even greater completeness:\n*   **Point of View:** While \"presented as footage on a CRT monitor\" is a great description of the *style*, the caption could also explicitly state that the point of view is a static, fixed-camera shot, which is implied by the security-style overlay.\n*   **Time of Day:** The caption notes the timecode \"19:25\" but doesn't explicitly state the time of day is the evening, which is a direct inference from the overlay data.\n*   **Minor Details:** The description of the table is omitted. Adding its material or color (e.g., \"a dark-colored table\") would add a bit more detail to the setting.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It successfully combines details into a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly identifies and describes the overlays, specifying their content and location as instructed.\n    *   It avoids speculation, emotional language, and subjective descriptions.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery, mentioning the subject only in relation to her placement and context.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly describes the unique visual style (CRT monitor, scan lines, greenish tint).\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary instruction not fully met is the explicit statement of the **point of view** (e.g., \"From a fixed-camera point of view...\") and the **time of day** (\"evening\"). While the information to deduce these is present in the caption, the instruction asks for them to be stated directly.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is of high quality and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. The feedback provided is for refinement rather than correction. It is an effective and well-written description that meets nearly all the specified criteria.",
