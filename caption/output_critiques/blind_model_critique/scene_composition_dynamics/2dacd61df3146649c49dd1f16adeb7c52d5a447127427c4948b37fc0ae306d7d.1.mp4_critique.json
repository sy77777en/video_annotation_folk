    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone shows a long, dilapidated hallway inside an abandoned building. The walls are covered in graffiti of various colors, including green, black, and purple. Debris, consisting of broken wood and concrete, litters the floor. A row of large windows lines one side of the hallway, offering a view of dense green trees outside. The hallway stretches into the distance, with a faint light visible at the far end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the drone point of view and the abandoned building setting, but it could be improved by clarifying the initial scene and the transition. The description begins with a \"large pile of wooden debris obstructing the path,\" but it is unclear if this path is outside or just inside the entrance; a more precise description would state that the drone first flies through a broken doorway or a shattered window to enter the building. The caption describes the drone's movement over the debris but then presents the hallway as a static scene. It would be more dynamic to describe the continuous motion, such as the drone gliding steadily down the length of the hall, which would better reflect the nature of a video. Furthermore, while the windows are mentioned, their condition is omitted; specifying that they are large, paneless industrial windows with rusted frames would add significant detail. The description of debris could also be more specific, noting splintered floorboards and chunks of fallen plaster alongside the wood and concrete. Finally, the caption misses the opportunity to describe how the drone's smooth, floating perspective creates a detached, ghostly tour of the decaying space, a key element of the viewer's experience.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a drone smoothly gliding through a broken doorway, entering an abandoned building. Inside, a large pile of wooden debris obstructs the path just beyond the entrance. As the drone continues its steady flight down the long, dilapidated hallway, the walls are revealed to be covered in vibrant graffiti in shades of green, black, and purple. The floor is littered with splintered floorboards, chunks of fallen plaster, and broken concrete. On one side, large, paneless industrial windows with rusted frames offer a view of dense green trees outside. The drone's smooth, floating perspective provides a detached, ghostly tour of the decaying space, capturing the hallway as it stretches into the distance, with a faint light visible at the far end.",
