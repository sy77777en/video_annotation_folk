    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a vehicle during nighttime. The environment is dimly lit, with the interior illuminated by soft, ambient light reflecting off the wet, rain-speckled windows, suggesting rainy weather outside. The scene features a person seated in the driver's seat, holding a takeout container with chopsticks, indicating a casual, intimate moment. The vehicle's dashboard and steering wheel are visible, with a coiled cord hanging nearby, adding to the confined, personal atmosphere. The overall color palette is muted, with dark tones and subtle highlights from the exterior lights filtering through the rain-streaked glass, creating a moody, contemplative ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the scene, but it fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and inference.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the core visual elements: an indoor vehicle setting at night, a person with a takeout container, rain on the windows, and the presence of a dashboard and steering wheel. The description of the lighting and color palette is also factually correct based on the described scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in two key areas:\n1.  **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly ask to indicate the point of view (e.g., first-person, passenger's view), which is missing from the caption.\n2.  **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene. If the video includes any motion, such as rain running down the glass, passing lights, or the person eating, this detail is omitted.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several explicit rules outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses words like \"casual,\" \"intimate,\" \"personal,\" \"moody,\" and \"contemplative.\" These are all subjective interpretations of the scene's feeling, which is strictly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes\":** The caption repeatedly infers meaning and purpose.\n    *   \"...indicating a casual, intimate moment.\" (Inference)\n    *   \"...adding to the confined, personal atmosphere.\" (Explaining emphasis)\n    *   \"...creating a moody, contemplative ambiance.\" (Explaining emphasis and mood)\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"**suggesting** rainy weather\" is speculative. The instructions require stating what is visible. The presence of wet, rain-speckled windows is a direct observation of rainy conditions, not a suggestion.\n*   **Violation of \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text\":** The caption begins with \"The video depicts...,\" which is introductory text. The description should start directly with the scene itself.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a passenger's point of view, the scene is set inside a vehicle at night during rainy weather. The dark interior is dimly illuminated by ambient light reflecting off the wet, rain-streaked side windows. A person is visible in the driver's seat, holding a white takeout container and a pair of chopsticks. In the foreground, the vehicle's dashboard, steering wheel, and a black coiled cord are visible. The overall color palette is muted and dark, with subtle highlights from exterior lights filtering through the water on the glass.",
