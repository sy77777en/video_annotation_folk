    "pre_caption": "The video presents an expansive view of outer space, featuring a vast, star-filled cosmos. The setting is outdoors in the infinite expanse of the universe, with no specific location on Earth. The time of day is irrelevant in this context, as the scene is set in the timeless void of space. Notable visual elements include swirling nebulae with hues of blue, green, and purple, creating a textured and ethereal backdrop. Countless stars are scattered throughout, varying in brightness and size, adding depth to the scene. The overall atmosphere is serene and otherworldly, with the nebulae's gaseous formations appearing soft and cloud-like against the dark, infinite void.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to follow several key negative constraints and structural requirements from the instructions. While it captures the general essence of the scene, its execution is flawed.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption accurately describes the visual content of a typical space nebula video. The elements mentioned (stars, swirling nebulae, colors like blue, green, and purple) are consistent with such a scene.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., static shot, slow pan, fly-through), which is a required element that significantly influences the viewer's perception.\n*   **Missing Motion:** While it uses the word \"swirling,\" it does not explicitly describe any **motion or changes** within the scene, such as the movement of the gas clouds or the camera's path.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates numerous specific instructions:\n\n*   **Violation - No Introductory Text:** It begins with \"The video presents...\", which is introductory text. The description should start directly.\n*   **Violation - No Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses several subjective words, such as \"expansive,\" \"ethereal,\" \"serene,\" and \"otherworldly.\" These are explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation - No Speculative Statements:** It uses \"appearing soft and cloud-like,\" which is a form of speculation (\"it appears\"). It also uses \"infinite,\" which is an unverifiable and speculative quality.\n*   **Violation - Do Not Explain or Infer:** The caption is filled with explanations instead of direct descriptions.\n    *   \"The time of day is irrelevant in this context...\" explains why something is omitted.\n    *   \"...creating a textured and ethereal backdrop\" explains the function of the nebulae.\n    *   \"...adding depth to the scene\" explains the effect of the stars.\n*   **Violation - Simple, Natural English:** Phrases like \"The setting is outdoors in the infinite expanse of the universe\" and \"the timeless void of space\" are overly descriptive and less direct than required.\n*   **Violation - No Markdown or Introductory Text:** The final output should be a single paragraph with no other text, but the caption itself contains meta-commentary that functions like an introduction (e.g., \"Notable visual elements include...\").\n\n---\n\n### Revised Example (Following All Instructions)\n\nA wide shot captures an outdoor scene in outer space. Swirling nebulae with hues of blue, green, and purple drift across the view. The gaseous formations have a soft, cloud-like texture against a dark background scattered with stars of varying size and brightness.",
