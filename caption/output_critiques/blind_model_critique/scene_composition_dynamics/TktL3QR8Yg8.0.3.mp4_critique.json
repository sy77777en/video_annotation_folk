    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room with a warm, soft glow, a worn, pinkish-brown teddy bear with mismatched button and bead eyes and a faded pink scarf sits on a dark surface. As the scene comes into focus, a hand places a dark, stitched cap on the bear's head. The background is softly blurred, revealing the silhouette of a wooden chair and a faint depiction of a horse.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few areas where it deviates from the specific instructions.\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a teddy bear), its specific features (worn, pinkish-brown, mismatched eyes, pink scarf), the action (a hand placing a cap on its head), and the background elements (wooden chair, horse depiction). The description of the lighting (\"dimly lit room with a warm, soft glow\") is also precise.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one key element required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** The instruction asks to \"indicate the point of view.\" The video is a static, close-up shot. This detail is omitted from the caption.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction:\nThis is where the caption has the most significant room for improvement.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It successfully combines details from the video into a single, coherent paragraph without referring to specific frames.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" and speculative language like \"it appears.\"\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives.\n*   It correctly describes the motion (\"a hand places a dark, stitched cap\") and the change in focus (\"As the scene comes into focus\").\n*   It adheres to the formatting requirement of a single paragraph with no introductory text.\n\n**Where it deviates:**\n*   **Focus:** The most significant deviation is the focus. The instruction explicitly states, \"**Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.**\" The caption does the opposite. It dedicates the majority of its text to a detailed description of the teddy bear (the subject) and gives minimal attention to the setting (the room).\n*   **Excessive Subject Detail:** While the details about the bear are accurate, they are more granular than what the instructions call for, which prioritize the overall environment. A more compliant caption would have described the bear more briefly to allow for a greater focus on the room itself.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is well-written and accurate but does not fully align with the core requirements of the instructions. It excels in describing the subject and action but fails to prioritize the **setting** and omits the **point of view**.\n\n**To be fully compliant, the caption should be revised to:**\n1.  Begin by stating the point of view (e.g., \"From a static, close-up point of view...\").\n2.  Shift the focus from the bear's specific features to the room's overall atmosphere and elements, using the bear as a complementary part of the scene rather than its central focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a static, close-up point of view, the scene unfolds in a dimly lit room with a warm, soft glow. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with the silhouette of a wooden chair and a faint depiction of a horse softly blurred in the background. On a dark surface, a worn teddy bear with a pinkish-brown hue and a faded pink scarf sits quietly. A hand gently places a dark, stitched cap on the bear's head, adding a subtle motion to the tranquil setting.",
