    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the instructions. It is accurate, mostly complete, and follows the specified formatting and stylistic rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a coherent and plausible scene, logically connecting the elements: a first-person perspective, the movement from an indoor to an outdoor space, and the specific features of the environment (flagstones, patio, lawn, fence, landscape). The details provided, such as \"barefoot,\" \"blue jeans,\" and \"uneven flagstones,\" create a clear and precise mental picture that aligns with a real-world video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very thorough and includes most of the required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Clearly described, moving from an \"indoor space\" to an \"outdoor stone patio\" with a \"green lawn,\" \"wooden fence,\" and \"rural landscape.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Excellent detail on the \"large, uneven flagstones\" and \"wooden fence.\"\n*   **Motion & Transition:** The forward movement and the transition from indoors to outdoors are described perfectly.\n*   **Weather:** The \"cloudy sky\" is noted.\n\nThe one element missing is the explicit **time of day**. While \"cloudy sky\" implies daytime, the instruction asks for the time of day to be mentioned. Adding \"daytime\" would make it fully complete.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the rules almost perfectly.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It successfully balances detail with brevity.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** The description prioritizes the floor, patio, and landscape over the person, who serves mainly to establish the POV.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** It avoids words like \"appears\" or \"might be.\" The use of \"rustic\" is acceptable as a common stylistic descriptor for uneven stone. \"Vibrant\" is slightly subjective, but it is a common and effective descriptor for a strong color and is a very minor deviation.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear and easy to read.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n*   **Motion and Transitions:** It correctly describes the camera's forward movement and the change in setting.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by creating a description that is objective, detailed, and focused on the scenery and movement. Its only minor flaw is the omission of an explicit time of day.\n\nTo make it perfect according to the instructions, you could make a small adjustment:\n\n**Slightly Improved Version:**\nA first-person POV shot follows a barefoot person wearing blue jeans walking across a rustic floor of large, uneven flagstones. The camera moves forward, transitioning from an indoor space onto an outdoor stone patio that borders a large, bright green lawn. The lawn is enclosed by a wooden fence, and beyond it, a rural landscape with trees can be seen under a cloudy daytime sky.",
