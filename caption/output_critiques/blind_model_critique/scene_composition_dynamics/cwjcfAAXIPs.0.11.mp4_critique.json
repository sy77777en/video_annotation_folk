    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a person holding a black camera on a stone promenade in Porto, Portugal, during sunrise. The sun is low on the horizon, creating a bright flare and silhouetting a large, prominent tree against a clear blue sky. To the left, traditional European buildings line the waterfront, while across the river, a hillside covered with buildings is visible. The person is composing a shot, and the camera's screen displays a live view of the sunlit scene with the silhouetted tree.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of a \"first-person POV\" is contradicted by the phrase \"captures a person holding a black camera,\" which implies a third-person view; the video actually maintains a true first-person perspective where only the photographer's hands and the camera are visible. The description of a \"clear blue sky\" at sunrise is inaccurate, as the video shows a dynamic sky with a gradient of orange, pink, and yellow hues near the horizon. The caption also omits prominent and defining features of the Porto setting, such as the iconic Dom Luís I Bridge visible in the distance and the characteristic colorful, tiled facades of the buildings along the Cais da Ribeira. Furthermore, the description is static and fails to capture the motion in the scene, such as the gentle panning of the camera as the photographer refines the composition, the subtle movement of the hands adjusting the lens's focus ring, and the gentle ripples on the surface of the Douro River. While the camera's screen is mentioned, the caption misses the dynamic details on the display, like the blinking autofocus square locking onto the tree and the fluctuating exposure meter readings.",
