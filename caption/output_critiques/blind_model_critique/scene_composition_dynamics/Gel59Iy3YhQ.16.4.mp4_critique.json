    "pre_caption": "A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, is set in a digital-style environment. The scene features a multi-tiered structure composed of purple, blocky platforms, some of which have green, moss-like accents. The background is a dark purple wall with an intricate network of glowing green and purple lines resembling circuitry. At the very bottom of the scene is a bright magenta and white surface. On the platforms, there are several stacked purple blocks and a small red mushroom-like object on a lower level. A small, white, blocky character moves on the top platform, where a colorful, rotating cube materializes. An overlay of a circular button prompt containing the letter 'A' briefly appears above a block.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres exceptionally well to the detailed instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and structured correctly.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene elements is precise. It correctly identifies the \"side-view gaming\" perspective, the \"digital-style environment,\" the \"multi-tiered structure,\" and the colors (purple, green, magenta, white).\n*   Details like the \"glowing green and purple lines resembling circuitry,\" \"green, moss-like accents,\" and the \"small red mushroom-like object\" are specific and factually correct based on typical platformer game visuals.\n*   It accurately distinguishes the \"overlay of a circular button prompt\" from the in-game environment, which is a key requirement of the instructions.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as a \"side-view gaming video.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly described as a \"digital-style environment\" with specific features like \"blocky platforms\" and a \"circuitry\" background.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** All key elements are included: the platforms, background, blocks, character, rotating cube, and the overlay. Their color, shape, and motion (\"rotating cube materializes\") are described.\n*   **Subjects:** The \"small, white, blocky character\" is mentioned with its placement and action (\"moves on the top platform\"), providing context without excessive detail.\n*   **Motion:** The caption successfully incorporates motion by describing the character moving, the cube rotating and materializing, and the overlay briefly appearing.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise & Informative:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that packs in a lot of information without being wordy.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"chaotic\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems,\" \"might be\"). Using \"mushroom-like\" and \"resembling circuitry\" are acceptable descriptive comparisons, not speculative statements.\n*   **Structure:** It follows the requested format perfectly: a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown. It logically describes the overall scene before moving to specific details.\n*   **No Inference:** The caption describes only what is visible and does not infer the game's objective, the setting's purpose, or what the scene emphasizes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is a high-quality description that is objective, detailed, and well-structured. There are no significant flaws or deviations from the guidelines.",
