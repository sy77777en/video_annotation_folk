    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor event in a bustling urban setting, likely during the evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting and the dark sky. The scene is set at a red carpet event, with a backdrop of large, modern buildings and decorative elements like banners and lights. The environment is lively, with a crowd of people dressed in formal attire, suggesting a glamorous occasion. The broadcast POV shot is set up for television production, focusing on interactions between individuals. Notable visual elements include metallic and shimmering fabrics, adding to the event's opulent atmosphere. Overlays in the video include a logo and text reading \"ET Canada\" at the bottom left, indicating the broadcast source.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A broadcast POV shot where the camera is set up for television production.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the general context as an outdoor, urban red carpet event from a broadcast point of view, but it lacks the specific visual details and dynamic descriptions needed to accurately portray the scene. The description of the setting as \"bustling\" is not supported by descriptions of motion; the feedback should specify the constant movement of people walking the carpet, reporters conducting interviews, and the incessant, bright flashing of cameras from a designated photographers' area. The term \"transparent curtains\" is vague; a more accurate description would be sheer, silver-threaded drapes hanging from a black metal truss structure, which shimmer under the event lighting. The caption infers the time of day is \"likely early evening\" instead of describing the visible deep blue twilight sky above the glass-and-steel skyscrapers. Furthermore, it misses key environmental details such as the plush, crimson-red carpet itself, flanked by chrome stanchions and black velvet ropes that separate the main walkway from the press and onlookers. While the \"ET Canada\" overlay is noted, the caption could also mention the intermittent appearance of a lower-third graphic overlay in white and blue, displaying the names of individuals on screen. The description of \"interactions\" is too general; it should specify that the camera tracks a reporter who is actively interviewing subjects as they pause along the carpet.",
