    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor event in a bustling urban setting, likely during the evening, as indicated by the artificial lighting and the dark sky. The scene is set at a red carpet event, with a backdrop of large, modern buildings and decorative elements like banners and lights. The environment is lively, with a crowd of people dressed in formal attire, suggesting a glamorous occasion. The broadcast POV shot is set up for television production, focusing on interactions between individuals. Notable visual elements include metallic and shimmering fabrics, adding to the event's opulent atmosphere. Overlays in the video include a logo and text reading \"ET Canada\" at the bottom left, indicating the broadcast source.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A broadcast POV shot where the camera is set up for television production.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it correctly identifies several key elements of the scene, it fails to adhere to multiple core negative constraints, particularly regarding tone, speculation, and inference.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the setting as an outdoor, urban, red carpet event at night with modern buildings. It also accurately describes the \"ET Canada\" overlay, including its content and position.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption fails to describe any **motion**. An event like this would involve people moving, talking, and gesturing. The instruction specifically asks to describe \"human-made movements such as... pedestrians walking along a busy street.\" The caption presents a static description of a dynamic event, which is a significant omission for a video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":**\n    *   The caption uses the phrase \"**likely** during the evening.\" The instruction explicitly forbids speculative language like \"might be\" or \"it appears.\" The presence of a dark sky and artificial lights is definitive evidence of it being nighttime, so it should be stated as a fact.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":**\n    *   The caption is filled with subjective words: \"**bustling**,\" \"**lively**,\" \"**glamorous**,\" and \"**opulent**.\" These words interpret the scene's mood rather than describing its physical characteristics, which is directly against the instructions.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role... Do not explain what the scene emphasizes\":**\n    *   The caption repeatedly explains the *meaning* or *purpose* of visual elements instead of just describing them.\n    *   \"...**as indicated by** the artificial lighting...\" explains how the time of day is determined.\n    *   \"...**suggesting a glamorous occasion**.\" infers the nature of the event.\n    *   \"...**adding to the event's opulent atmosphere**.\" explains the effect of the fabrics.\n    *   \"...**indicating the broadcast source**.\" explains the purpose of the overlay.\n    *   All of these phrases violate the rule to describe only what is visible without interpretation.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":**\n    *   The phrase \"...focusing on **interactions between individuals**\" shifts the focus from the camera's technical point of view to the subjects' social activities, which borders on excessive subject detail.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the basic components of the scene but fundamentally misunderstands the core requirements of the instructions. It adopts an interpretive and subjective tone, uses speculative language, and explains the purpose of elements, all of which are explicitly forbidden. A good caption, according to the rules, would be a much more sterile, factual, and objective description of the physical environment and its visible components.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an outdoor event in an urban setting at night, with artificial lighting and a dark sky. The scene is a red carpet event surrounded by large modern buildings, banners, and lights. The environment includes a crowd of people in formal attire.
