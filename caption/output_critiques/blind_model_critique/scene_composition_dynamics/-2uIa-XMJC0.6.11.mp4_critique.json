A large, transparent screen displays a video call interface with a circular view of an outdoor urban setting, showing buildings and a clear sky.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but fails to follow several key instructions. It successfully identifies the point of view and general setting but includes speculative language, subjective descriptions, and interpretations, all of which are explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the core elements: a first-person POV, an indoor setting, a screen displaying a video call, and a daytime setting. The description of the screen's content (a circular view of a city, a smaller inset of a person) is clear and precise.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption describes the most prominent element (the screen) but offers little information about the surrounding \"modern, high-tech environment.\" The instructions ask for descriptions of the overall scene, and details about the room itself (walls, furniture, lighting fixtures) are missing.\n*   It does not mention any motion. If the person on the call is moving, or if there is movement in the city view on the screen, the caption is incomplete as it omits a key dynamic aspect of the video.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Speculative Language:** The instruction states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   The caption uses: \"**appears** to be daytime...\"\n    *   The caption uses: \"...**suggesting** a conversation.\" This is an inference about an activity, not a direct visual description.\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction asks for objective descriptions (color, material, shape) and to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses subjective labels like \"**modern**,\" \"**high-tech**,\" \"**sleek**,\" and \"**futuristic**.\" Instead of \"high-tech,\" it should describe specific visual features that create that impression (e.g., \"glowing blue interface elements,\" \"a minimalist design with metallic surfaces\").\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Inferring Purpose or Emphasis:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The caption concludes with: \"...**with a focus on digital communication technology**.\" This sentence directly explains the theme and purpose of the scene, which is a clear violation.\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Introductory Text:** The instruction asks to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n    *   The caption begins with \"**The video presents...**\" which is unnecessary introductory phrasing. The description should start directly (e.g., \"A first-person POV shot is set indoors...\").\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints in the instructions. While it correctly identifies the basic scene, its use of speculative language, subjective adjectives, and thematic interpretation directly contradicts the provided guidelines. A better caption would eliminate these violations and provide more objective, concrete details about the entire environment shown in the video.",
