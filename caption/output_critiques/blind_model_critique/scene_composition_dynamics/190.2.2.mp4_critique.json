    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an urban street scene during the day, featuring a quiet, tree-lined residential area. The setting includes brick buildings with small gardens and a sidewalk. A notable visual element is a gray car with a sleek, angular design, parked on the street. The car's metallic surface reflects the surroundings, adding a dynamic texture to the scene. The street is calm, with minimal traffic, and the lighting suggests a clear day, casting soft shadows on the pavement. The environment conveys a sense of tranquility and order, with neatly maintained surroundings and a peaceful atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and misses some required elements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**Failures:**\n\n*   **Avoids Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates this rule multiple times.\n    *   **\"quiet\"**: This is a subjective interpretation of the scene's atmosphere.\n    *   **\"sleek\"**: This is a subjective quality. A more objective description would focus on its shape (e.g., \"low-profile,\" \"angular\").\n    *   **\"calm\"**: Similar to \"quiet,\" this describes an emotional feeling rather than an observable fact.\n    *   **\"tranquility\"**, **\"order\"**, **\"peaceful atmosphere\"**: These are all significant violations, as they are purely interpretive and describe the mood and feeling of the scene, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n    *   **\"neatly maintained\"**: \"Neatly\" is a subjective judgment.\n\n*   **Avoids Speculative Statements:**\n    *   **\"lighting suggests a clear day\"**: The word \"suggests\" is a form of speculation. The instruction requires stating what is visible. A better phrasing would be \"The lighting indicates a clear day\" or \"Bright sunlight casts soft shadows.\"\n\n*   **Does Not Infer the Role or Emphasize Highlights:**\n    *   **\"adding a dynamic texture to the scene\"**: This explains the *effect* of the reflection, which falls under explaining what the scene \"highlights\" or \"emphasizes.\"\n    *   **\"The environment conveys a sense of tranquility and order...\"**: This entire sentence is an inference about the scene's role and meaning, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n**Successes:**\n\n*   The caption correctly describes the setting (urban street, residential area), time of day (day), and notable visual elements (brick buildings, gray car).\n*   It combines details into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids referring to specific frames or using terms like \"image.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits several required elements from the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** It does not mention the POV (e.g., eye-level, high-angle, drone shot), which is a mandatory component.\n*   **Motion or Changes:** While it mentions \"minimal traffic,\" it doesn't describe any actual movement, such as leaves rustling, clouds moving, or the specific movement of any vehicles or people, if present. If the video is a static shot, it should state that.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention if there are any overlays (text, watermarks, etc.), which is a required check.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions, based on the visual information provided in the original caption:\n\nFrom an eye-level perspective, the video shows an outdoor scene on a residential street during the day under clear skies. The street is lined with brick buildings, small gardens, and a concrete sidewalk. Trees cast soft shadows on the asphalt road, where a gray car with an angular design and a metallic surface is parked. There is minimal vehicle or pedestrian movement in the scene.",
