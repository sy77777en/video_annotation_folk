    "pre_caption": "An indoor scene shows a heavy, weathered metal door illuminated by a strong red light. The door, which has a rounded rectangular shape, features a small circular porthole at the top and a three-spoked wheel handle in the center. It is flanked by dark, metallic walls with vertical, ribbed structures. A text overlay reading \"TOP SECRET\" in a rectangular box is positioned on the lower section of the door. At the bottom of the screen, subtitles read, \"on board the deep sea vessel, weapons and technology.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subject and its key features, it fails to capture the dynamic nature and atmospheric perspective of the video. The description is static, but the video employs a slow, continuous dolly shot that moves forward from a low angle, making the heavy metal door feel increasingly large and intimidating. The caption also misses crucial environmental effects; the scene is filled with a light haze, and steam periodically vents from the joints of the vertical ribbed structures on the walls. Furthermore, the lighting is not constant; the red illumination pulses with a slow, rhythmic beat, and the \"TOP SECRET\" text, which is a digital display embedded in the door, flashes rather than simply glowing. The description of the door as \"weathered\" could be improved by noting the deep, vertical scratch marks and prominent rivets that are visible as the light pulses across its surface. Lastly, the caption should more clearly define the small white logo as a watermark overlay to distinguish it from the scene's actual elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A slow, continuous dolly shot from a low angle reveals an imposing, heavy metal door, its size and intimidation growing as the camera advances. The door, with a rounded rectangular shape, features a small circular porthole at the top and a three-spoked wheel handle in the center. Deep vertical scratch marks and prominent rivets become visible as a pulsing red light rhythmically illuminates the scene, enhancing the door's weathered appearance. The digital \"TOP SECRET\" display embedded in the door flashes intermittently. The surrounding dark metallic walls, with vertical ribbed structures, emit steam from their joints, adding to the atmospheric haze that fills the scene.
