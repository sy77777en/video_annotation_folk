    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a dimly lit salon or dressing room. A prominent, dome-shaped hair dryer, colored blue and white, is visible in the upper center. To the left, a large, circular mirror reflects a black and white checkered pattern. Vertical, glowing orange light strips are positioned near a wooden shelving unit in the background. The overall lighting is moody, with teals and blues dominating the ambiance, punctuated by the warm orange lights. A person with curlers in their hair and wearing white, square-rimmed sunglasses is in the foreground, moving slightly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the main elements, but it misses the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot that gives the viewer a direct, observational perspective. The phrase \"what appears to be\" is speculative and should be removed; the setting can be established by its contents alone. The description lacks specificity regarding materials and missed details; for instance, the blue and white hair dryer has a glossy plastic finish with chrome trim, and the wooden shelving unit is dark-stained and holds the silhouettes of spray bottles and jars. The caption also fails to mention a semi-transparent social media handle watermark in the bottom right corner. Furthermore, it misinterprets the \"vertical, glowing orange light strips,\" which are actually a flickering neon sign in the background, and it doesn't clarify that the \"black and white checkered pattern\" is the floor tile, visible only as a reflection in the large circular mirror. Finally, while the person's slight movement is noted, the description of their curlers and sunglasses is overly detailed, drawing focus from the scenery, which goes against the instruction to prioritize the setting.",
