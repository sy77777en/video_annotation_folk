    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban environment during sunset. The setting is outdoors, showcasing a cityscape with a mix of modern high-rise buildings and construction sites. The sky is a blend of soft blues and warm oranges, indicating the transition from day to night. Notable visual elements include cranes and partially constructed structures, suggesting ongoing development. The buildings are primarily glass and steel, reflecting the fading sunlight. Streets below are visible, with scattered lights beginning to illuminate the scene. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the drone's movement providing a sweeping perspective of the city's architectural features and the vibrant colors of the sunset.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the drone point of view, the sunset timing, and the general urban environment with construction sites. However, it omits a prominent geographical feature visible throughout the video: a wide river that flows through the center of the city, with a large, illuminated suspension bridge connecting the two sides. The description of the lights as \"scattered\" is also too general; the video clearly shows distinct red and white light trails from moving traffic on the streets below and a grid-like pattern of yellow lights activating within the glass office buildings as the sky darkens. The phrase \"suggesting ongoing development\" is an inference, which should be avoided in favor of simply describing the presence of the yellow cranes and steel-frame structures. Similarly, the use of subjective words like \"dynamic\" and \"vibrant\" should be removed. The description of the drone's motion as a \"sweeping perspective\" is vague; a more precise description would be \"a slow, continuous pan from left to right,\" which better captures the camera's movement. Lastly, the caption fails to mention a semi-transparent watermark overlay in the bottom-right corner that reads \"@DroneScapes.\"",
