    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, dense forest setting during daylight. Tall trees with thick trunks and vibrant green foliage dominate the scene, creating a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with a mix of brown earth and scattered moss-covered rocks, adding texture and color contrast. A narrow, winding path meanders through the trees, suggesting a natural trail. A small stream flows gently, its clear water reflecting the surrounding greenery. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the drone's perspective providing a sweeping view of the forest's depth and natural beauty.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and captures the general essence of the described scene. However, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding the avoidance of subjective language, speculation, and explaining the scene's effect on the viewer.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy & Completeness:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the core visual elements one would expect in a drone shot of a forest: a drone POV, a dense forest, daylight, trees, a path, and a stream. The descriptions of color and texture (\"vibrant green foliage,\" \"moss-covered rocks\") are effective.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully includes the point of view, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. It also correctly describes motion (\"stream flows gently\"). It covers all the necessary components for a basic scene description.\n\n**2. Adherence to Instructions (Violations):**\n\nThe caption violates several specific rules outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives.**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses: \"**lush**,\" \"**serene**,\" and \"natural **beauty**.\" These words describe a feeling or a subjective quality rather than an objective, observable fact. \"Lush\" is borderline but leans subjective; \"serene\" and \"beauty\" are clear violations.\n\n*   **Violation: Speculative and Inferential Statements.**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   The caption states: \"...**suggesting** a natural trail.\" This is an inference about the path's nature. The instruction requires describing only what is visible.\n    *   The caption also uses the word \"**untouched**,\" which is an inference about the forest's history and condition that cannot be confirmed visually, especially since a path is present.\n\n*   **Violation: Explaining What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights.**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The caption states: \"...**adding texture and color contrast**.\" This explains the compositional effect of the rocks, which is forbidden.\n    *   The caption also states: \"...with the drone's perspective **providing a sweeping view of the forest's depth and natural beauty**.\" This explains the effect of the point of view, which goes against the instruction to simply describe the scene.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that strictly adheres to all the instructions:\n\nFrom a drone's point of view, the scene is a dense forest during daylight. Tall trees with thick trunks and green foliage form a canopy, with sunlight filtering through to the forest floor. The ground is a mix of brown earth and moss-covered rocks. A narrow, winding path runs through the trees, and a small, clear stream flows through the area, reflecting the surrounding greenery.",
