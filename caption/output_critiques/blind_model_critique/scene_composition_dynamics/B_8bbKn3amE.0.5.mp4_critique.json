    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone flies low and fast over the dense, reddish-brown terracotta tile roofs of a city built on a steep hillside. The buildings have white and off-white walls, with some featuring blue or green window frames. In the background, large, arid mountains rise under a clear blue sky with a few light clouds.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres closely to the vast majority of the instructions. It is well-written, descriptive, and objective.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the caption accurately reflects the video's content, its descriptive language is excellent. It uses precise terms for colors (\"reddish-brown,\" \"off-white\"), materials (\"terracotta tile,\" \"brick,\" \"stone\"), and natural features (\"arid mountains,\" \"clear blue sky\"). The description of the drone's movement and the layout of the city is logical and easy to visualize.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very thorough but misses a couple of minor points from the instructions:\n\n*   **Time of Day:** The caption implies daytime with \"clear blue sky,\" but the instructions ask to explicitly \"Mention the time of day.\" Adding a phrase like \"during the day\" would make it fully compliant.\n*   **Influence of POV:** The caption correctly identifies the point of view as a \"drone\" and describes its motion (\"flies low and fast\"). However, the instructions also ask to \"describe how it influences the viewer’s perception.\" The caption doesn't explicitly state the effect of this POV (e.g., creating a dynamic, sweeping perspective).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the provided rules exceptionally well.\n\n**What the caption does correctly:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich, single-paragraph summary without unnecessary words.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly prioritizes the environment, architecture, and natural landscape over any potential subjects.\n*   **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"charming\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n*   **No Prohibited Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" (except in the slightly redundant opening phrase).\n*   **Describes Motion:** It clearly explains the movement of the drone (\"flies low and fast,\" \"moves towards\").\n*   **Details Visual Elements:** It excels at describing the color, material, and shape of buildings and landscape features as instructed.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n\n**Minor Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   The opening, \"A video filmed by a drone flies...,\" is slightly redundant. A more direct and concise opening would be \"From a drone's point of view, the camera flies...\" or simply \"A drone flies...\"\n*   As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" explicitly stating the time of day and the perceptual effect of the drone shot would make it perfectly aligned with all instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a drone's point of view, the camera flies low and fast over the dense, reddish-brown terracotta tile roofs of a city built on a steep hillside during the day. The buildings have white and off-white walls, with some featuring blue or green window frames. In the background, large, arid mountains rise under a clear blue sky with a few light clouds. The drone's dynamic, sweeping perspective enhances the viewer's perception of the city's layout and architecture as it moves towards a white church with a brick bell tower, which sits on an elevated piece of land with stone retaining walls and a set of stairs leading up to it.",
