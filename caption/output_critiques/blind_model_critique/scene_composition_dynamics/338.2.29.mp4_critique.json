    "pre_caption": "The video is set in a cozy, warmly lit indoor restaurant with a classic, slightly ornate decor. The environment features round tables covered with white tablecloths, surrounded by dark wooden chairs with cushioned seats. The walls are adorned with intricate, gold-toned decorative panels and artwork, adding a touch of elegance. The setting is lively, with patrons seated at tables, engaged in conversation and dining. The time of day is likely evening, suggested by the indoor lighting and relaxed atmosphere. Notable visual elements include a variety of dishes and drinks on the tables, and the presence of waitstaff in uniform, contributing to the bustling yet intimate dining experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview of the restaurant's ambiance but misses several key details and violates some instructions. It fails to specify the first-person point of view, which is crucial as the camera moves from the entrance to a table, making the viewer feel as if they are the one being seated. The use of subjective words like \"cozy,\" \"classic,\" and \"elegance\" should be replaced with more objective descriptions; for example, instead of \"warmly lit,\" it could describe the large, low-hanging brass chandeliers with exposed filament bulbs and the single white candle flickering on each table. The phrase \"likely evening\" is speculative; the video clearly shows a dark, rainy street through the large paned windows, confirming it is nighttime. The description of the decor is too general; the \"gold-toned decorative panels\" are set against deep navy-blue walls, and the \"artwork\" consists of framed black-and-white photographs of cityscapes. Furthermore, the caption omits the polished herringbone-patterned wood floor and the small, semi-transparent restaurant logo watermark in the bottom-right corner. The description of motion could also be more specific by mentioning waitstaff in black aprons moving between tables and the subtle clinking of glasses and silverware that accompanies the visual activity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "As you enter the restaurant, the camera captures your perspective, moving from the entrance to a table, immersing you in the experience of being seated. The setting is an indoor restaurant with large, low-hanging brass chandeliers featuring exposed filament bulbs, casting a warm glow. Each table is adorned with a single white candle flickering gently. The decor includes deep navy-blue walls with gold-toned decorative panels and framed black-and-white photographs of cityscapes. Through the large paned windows, a dark, rainy street confirms it is nighttime. The polished herringbone-patterned wood floor adds to the refined atmosphere. Patrons are engaged in lively conversation, dining at round tables covered with white tablecloths, surrounded by dark wooden chairs with cushioned seats. Waitstaff in black aprons move gracefully between tables, and the subtle clinking of glasses and silverware enhances the bustling yet intimate dining experience.
