    "pre_caption": "The video is set in a cozy, warmly lit indoor restaurant with a classic, slightly ornate decor. The environment features round tables covered with white tablecloths, surrounded by dark wooden chairs with cushioned seats. The walls are adorned with intricate, gold-toned decorative panels and artwork, adding a touch of elegance. The setting is lively, with patrons seated at tables, engaged in conversation and dining. The time of day is likely evening, suggested by the indoor lighting and relaxed atmosphere. Notable visual elements include a variety of dishes and drinks on the tables, and the presence of waitstaff in uniform, contributing to the bustling yet intimate dining experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints outlined in the instructions. While it successfully describes the general environment, it violates rules regarding subjectivity, speculation, and inference.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description of the physical elements—round tables with white tablecloths, dark wooden chairs, and gold-toned decorative panels—is specific and appears to accurately capture a restaurant scene. The presence of patrons and waitstaff is also noted correctly.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in a few critical areas:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** It completely omits the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, first-person), which is a required element in the instructions.\n*   **Motion:** While it mentions patrons are \"engaged in conversation and dining,\" it fails to describe any camera movement (like a pan, tilt, or dolly) or more specific actions that might be occurring.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention if there are any overlays like text, watermarks, or icons. If none exist, this is fine, but if they do, it's an omission.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses numerous subjective words that describe feelings or interpretations rather than objective facts.\n    *   **Examples:** \"cozy,\" \"classic,\" \"ornate,\" \"elegance,\" \"lively,\" \"relaxed atmosphere,\" \"bustling yet intimate dining experience.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The instruction explicitly forbids phrases like 'it appears' or 'might be.'\n    *   **Example:** The phrase \"**likely evening**\" is a speculative guess based on the lighting, which is not allowed. It should simply state the observable facts (e.g., \"an artificially lit indoor setting\").\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption interprets the purpose and effect of visual elements.\n    *   **Example:** \"...**adding a touch of elegance**\" explains the *effect* of the decorative panels, which is forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The caption draws conclusions about the experience.\n    *   **Example:** \"...**contributing to the bustling yet intimate dining experience**\" infers the role and feeling of the setting, which is explicitly disallowed.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text\":** The caption begins with \"The video is set in...,\" which is unnecessary introductory phrasing. The description should begin directly with the scene's details.\n\nIn summary, the caption writer correctly identified the key elements of the scene but failed to present them according to the strict, objective style demanded by the instructions. The final text is more of a subjective review than a neutral, factual description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an indoor restaurant with round tables covered in white tablecloths and surrounded by dark wooden chairs with cushioned seats, the walls display gold-toned decorative panels and artwork. Patrons are seated at tables, engaged in conversation and dining, while waitstaff in uniform move about. The setting is artificially lit, suggesting an indoor environment. The video is captured from a static point of view, with no visible camera movement. There are no overlays such as text or icons present in the scene.",
