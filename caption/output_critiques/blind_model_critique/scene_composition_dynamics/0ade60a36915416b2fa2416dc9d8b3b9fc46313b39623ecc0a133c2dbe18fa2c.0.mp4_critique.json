    "pre_caption": "The video presents an expansive view of outer space, featuring two distinct celestial bodies. Initially, Mars is depicted with its reddish-brown surface, marked by craters and canyons, alongside a small, irregularly shaped moon. The scene transitions to Earth, showcasing its vibrant blue oceans, green and brown landmasses, and swirling white clouds. The setting is the vast, dark expanse of space, dotted with distant stars, providing a stark contrast to the vivid colors of the planets. The video captures the serene and majestic nature of the cosmos from an objective perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is **not good** because while it is factually descriptive, it violates several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding tone and interpretation.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption accurately describes a plausible video sequence. The descriptions of Mars (\"reddish-brown surface, marked by craters and canyons\"), its moon (\"small, irregularly shaped\"), and Earth (\"vibrant blue oceans, green and brown landmasses, and swirling white clouds\") are specific and visually grounded.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully includes the setting (outer space), notable visual elements (planets, moon, stars), their colors and features, and a scene transition.\n*   **Weaknesses:** It fails to specify the **point of view** as instructed (e.g., static shot, slow pan, fly-by). It mentions an \"objective perspective,\" which is an interpretation of tone rather than a description of the camera's position or movement. It also doesn't specify the *type* of transition (e.g., hard cut, fade, cross-dissolve).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **VIOLATION: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses **\"vibrant\"**, **\"serene\"**, and **\"majestic\"**. These words describe feelings and qualities rather than objective visual facts.\n\n*   **VIOLATION: Explaining What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The line \"...providing a stark contrast to the vivid colors of the planets\" explains a visual effect and its purpose, which is a form of interpretation.\n    *   The final sentence, \"The video captures the serene and majestic nature of the cosmos from an objective perspective,\" is a direct violation. It summarizes the theme and intended feeling of the video instead of just describing the visual content.\n\n*   **VIOLATION: Inclusion of Introductory Text:**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n    *   The caption begins with \"The video presents...\", which is an unnecessary introductory phrase. The description should start directly with the scene itself.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions correctly:\n\nAn expansive view of outer space shows Mars, its reddish-brown surface detailed with craters and canyons, alongside a small, irregularly shaped moon. The scene then transitions to a view of Earth, which displays blue oceans, green and brown landmasses, and swirling white clouds. Both celestial bodies are set against the dark expanse of space, which is dotted with distant stars.",
