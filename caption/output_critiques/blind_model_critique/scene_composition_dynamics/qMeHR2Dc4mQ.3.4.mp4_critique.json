    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption correctly identifies the indoor setting and the primary subject, but it misses several key details and violates a core instruction. The phrase \"possibly a picture frame\" is speculative, which the instructions explicitly forbid; instead, you should describe the object based only on its visible characteristics, such as \"a blurred, dark rectangular form.\" The caption also fails to specify the point of view, which appears to be a static, eye-level shot common for interviews or direct addresses. While you mention the man is speaking, you omit any description of his motion, such as hand gestures or head movements, which are likely present. Furthermore, the description of the room is too general; you could specify the wall's color more precisely (e.g., \"an off-white wall\") and note its texture if visible (e.g., smooth drywall). The lighting description, \"warm and subdued,\" is somewhat subjective; a more objective description would mention the direction of the light, such as \"lit from the front-left, creating a soft shadow on the right side of his face.\" Finally, you have not accounted for potential overlays, which are common in this type of video. For instance, there could be a lower-third graphic with the speaker's name and title or subtitles at the bottom of the screen, both of which are essential elements to include if present.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit room with an off-white, smooth drywall background. A blurred, dark rectangular form is visible on the wall. The lighting comes from the front-left, casting a soft shadow on the right side of the older man's face. He has gray hair and wears a dark green, collared shirt. Positioned in the foreground, he looks directly at the camera in a static, eye-level shot typical of interviews or direct addresses. As he speaks, he occasionally gestures with his hands and nods his head. There is a lower-third graphic displaying his name and title, and subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen.",
