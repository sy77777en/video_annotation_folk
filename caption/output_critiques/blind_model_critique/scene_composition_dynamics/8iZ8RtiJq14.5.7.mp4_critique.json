    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** A figure with a metallic, featureless head stands with its hands on its hips in an indoor setting. The figure wears a grey, two-button business suit over a light-colored v-neck shirt. The background consists of a wall made of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light illuminates the figure from the side, creating a distinct outline.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. Every detail mentioned is factually correct and visible in the video. The description of the figure's head (\"metallic, featureless\"), pose (\"hands on its hips\"), attire (\"grey, two-button business suit,\" \"light-colored v-neck shirt\"), background (\"vertical, brown wooden planks\"), and lighting (\"blue light... from the side\") perfectly matches the visual content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete for a static scene. It successfully identifies and describes all the primary visual elements: the subject, the background, and the key lighting. It correctly omits details that are not present, such as motion, scene transitions, or overlays.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions, but there are a few minor points of deviation.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet provides a clear and comprehensive picture of the scene.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It correctly avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   **Notable Elements:** It effectively describes the color, material, and shape of key elements like the figure's head and the background wall.\n    *   **No Inference:** It refrains from inferring the purpose of the setting or what the scene emphasizes.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions ask to indicate the point of view if relevant. The caption omits that this is a static, eye-level shot, which is a key aspect of how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n    *   **Focus on Setting vs. Subject:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\" While the figure is the main element, the caption dedicates half of its content to describing the figure's appearance and clothing in detail. It follows the instruction to keep subject details from being \"excessive,\" but the balance could be shifted slightly more toward the environment to better align with the core instruction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, clear, and follows the majority of the complex rules provided. Its main weakness is the omission of the point of view and a slightly stronger focus on the subject than the instructions ideally call for. However, given the simplicity of the scene, these are minor issues, and the caption successfully creates a precise and objective description of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an indoor setting, a static, eye-level shot captures a figure with a metallic, featureless head standing with its hands on its hips. The figure is dressed in a grey, two-button business suit over a light-colored v-neck shirt. The background features a wall made of vertical, brown wooden planks, and a blue light from the side casts a distinct outline on the figure.",
