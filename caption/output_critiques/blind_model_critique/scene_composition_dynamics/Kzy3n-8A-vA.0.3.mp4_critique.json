    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved to better align with the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as an outdoor town street at night, the presence of low-rise buildings, a dark road, and hills in the background. The descriptions of the colorful neon signs, including their specific text (\"Mrs. MUFF,\" \"MUDDY'S MUDFLAPS,\" \"EAT,\" \"WIMPY'S\"), colors, and shapes (vertical, arrow-shaped), are precise. The description of the moving vehicles, including a red fire truck and classic-style cars, is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete but has one significant omission. The scene is clearly a depiction of Radiator Springs from the movie *Cars*. The instruction states, \"If the location is known, state it explicitly.\" By describing it as a generic \"town street,\" the caption misses this key piece of information. Additionally, while it mentions an \"outdoor view,\" it doesn't specify the point of view (e.g., a static, street-level shot) as requested by the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows most of the rules. It is a single, concise paragraph, uses simple and objective language, and avoids emotional or speculative words. It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery, describes motion (\"drives down the street,\" \"move along the road\"), and details the color, shape, and text of notable visual elements without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The primary failure is not identifying the known, famous location (Radiator Springs), which was an explicit requirement. The description of the point of view is also too vague.\n\nIn summary, the caption is well-written and accurately describes the visual details of the scene. However, its failure to identify the specific, well-known location and provide a more descriptive point of view prevents it from fully meeting all the requirements of the instructions.",
