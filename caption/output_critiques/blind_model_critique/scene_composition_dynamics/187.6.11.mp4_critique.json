    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors, featuring a dimly lit room with warm, muted lighting that casts soft shadows. The environment suggests a cozy, intimate space, with a closed door visible in the background. The walls are plain, and the lighting creates a calm, subdued atmosphere. The scene includes a person wearing a patterned headscarf, positioned near the door, with their face partially illuminated by the ambient light. The video includes overlay elements, specifically subtitles at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue between two individuals. The text is white and clearly legible against the darker background, providing context to the interaction without being part of the physical scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly those regarding objectivity, inference, and completeness.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the physical scene (dimly lit room, person in a headscarf, closed door, subtitles) appears to be factually correct based on the details provided.\n*   **Inaccurate Inference:** The caption states the subtitles are \"displaying dialogue between two individuals.\" Unless speaker names are visible, this is an inference. The instruction is to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" A more accurate description would be \"displaying lines of text.\"\n\n#### Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key elements required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instruction explicitly asks to \"indicate the point of view.\" The caption fails to mention if this is a static shot, a handheld shot, an eye-level view, etc.\n*   **Motion or Changes:** The instructions require a description of \"motion or changes,\" such as a person's subtle movements or a static camera. The caption does not mention if the scene is completely still or if there is any movement.\n*   **Material and Texture:** While it mentions a \"patterned headscarf\" and \"plain walls,\" it misses the opportunity to describe the material of the door (e.g., wooden, metal) or the texture of the walls, as requested for notable visual elements.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":**\n    *   The caption uses words like **\"cozy,\" \"intimate,\" \"calm,\"** and **\"subdued.\"** These are subjective interpretations of the atmosphere, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   It also uses **\"clearly legible,\"** which is a subjective judgment.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes\":**\n    *   The phrase **\"suggests a cozy, intimate space\"** is a direct inference about the room's purpose or feeling.\n    *   The statement **\"the lighting creates a calm, subdued atmosphere\"** explains the *effect* of the lighting rather than just describing it objectively.\n    *   The clause **\"providing context to the interaction\"** explains the *function* of the subtitles, which is a form of interpretation that the instructions prohibit.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Be concise\":**\n    *   The phrase **\"without being part of the physical scene\"** is redundant. The instruction to identify elements as \"overlays\" already accomplishes this, making the additional clause unnecessary.\n\n### Revised Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions, based on the information in the original caption:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with warm, low-key lighting. In the background, there is a closed, flat-paneled door. A person wearing a patterned headscarf is positioned in the right side of the scene near the door, with their face partially in shadow. Overlaying the bottom of the video are two lines of white subtitle text set against the dark background.",
