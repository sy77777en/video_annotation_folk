    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a dense, foggy forest with tall, leafless trees reaching into a gray, overcast sky. The atmosphere is eerie and still, with a muted color palette dominated by grays and browns. The ground is covered in damp foliage, and the air appears heavy with mist. A person in a protective suit and gas mask stands among the trees, suggesting a hazardous environment. The suit is orange with black straps and equipment, including a gauge and a yellow device, adding a sense of caution and preparedness. The overall scene conveys a sense of isolation and quiet in a potentially dangerous natural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it violates several core negative constraints outlined in the instruction, particularly those regarding subjectivity, speculation, and interpretation. While it successfully describes some visual elements, its tone and language are contrary to the required objective style.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The descriptive elements (foggy forest, leafless trees, gray sky, orange suit with a gauge) are factually accurate based on the description provided.\n*   The use of \"The video depicts\" is slightly redundant but acceptable.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The instruction explicitly requires mentioning the POV (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld). The caption fails to include this crucial detail.\n*   **Missing Time of Day:** While \"gray, overcast sky\" implies daytime, the instruction asks for the time of day to be mentioned.\n*   **Missing Motion:** The caption describes the scene as \"still.\" If there is any subtle motion in the video (e.g., fog swirling, the person breathing), this detail is missed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It violates multiple negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives.**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses the word **\"eerie,\"** which is a subjective interpretation of the atmosphere.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Use of Speculative and Interpretive Language.**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   The caption uses **\"appears heavy with mist,\"** directly violating the \"no 'appears'\" rule.\n    *   The caption states the person's presence is **\"suggesting a hazardous environment.\"** This is an inference about the scene's context, which is forbidden.\n    *   The caption claims the suit is **\"adding a sense of caution and preparedness.\"** This interprets the *effect* of a visual element on the viewer, which is not allowed.\n    *   The caption describes the setting as **\"potentially dangerous,\"** which is both speculative (\"potentially\") and interpretive (\"dangerous\").\n\n*   **Violation 3: Explaining What the Scene Emphasizes or Conveys.**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The final sentence, **\"The overall scene conveys a sense of isolation and quiet in a potentially dangerous natural setting,\"** is a direct violation of this rule. It explicitly explains the mood and feeling the scene is meant to convey.\n\n### Corrected Example\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the outdoor scene is set within a dense forest during the day under a gray, overcast sky. Tall, leafless trees are surrounded by thick fog, and the ground is covered in damp foliage. A person stands among the trees wearing an orange protective suit with black straps and a gas mask. A gauge and a yellow device are attached to the suit.",
