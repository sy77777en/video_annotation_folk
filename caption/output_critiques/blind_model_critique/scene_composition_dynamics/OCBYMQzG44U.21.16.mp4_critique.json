    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through an indoor environment dominated by smooth, white tiled surfaces and curved architectural forms. The setting features a wide, spiraling staircase with a metal handrail, descending alongside tall, cylindrical columns and rounded walls. The tiles are small, square, and uniformly white, covering both the floor and walls, creating a clean, continuous appearance. The lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting artificial illumination without visible light sources, and the overall color palette is monochromatic with subtle greenish undertones. There are no windows or visible decorations, and the space feels enclosed and expansive, with the staircase leading downward toward a darker area partially obscured by the curve of the wall. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is highly detailed, well-structured, and successfully adheres to the vast majority of the instructions. It paints a clear and objective picture of the scene, focusing on the environment and key visual elements as requested. The few minor deviations are subtle and do not significantly detract from its quality.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy\nAssuming the caption accurately reflects the video's content, it is exceptionally precise. It describes specific architectural forms (\"spiraling staircase,\" \"cylindrical columns\"), materials (\"metal handrail\"), textures (\"smooth, white tiled surfaces\"), and a distinct color palette (\"monochromatic with subtle greenish undertones\"). The description of motion and perspective is also clear and specific.\n\n#### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes nearly all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Clearly stated as an \"indoor environment\" and described with defining features like the staircase and tiled surfaces.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Excellent detail is provided on the tiles, staircase, columns, and walls, including their color, material, and shape.\n*   **Lighting:** The \"soft and diffuse\" artificial lighting is well-described.\n*   **Motion:** The movement is captured with the phrase \"moves through.\"\n*   **Overlays:** The absence of overlays is explicitly and correctly noted.\n*   **Time of Day:** While not explicitly stated, the mention of \"artificial illumination\" and \"no windows\" correctly implies that the time of day is either irrelevant or indeterminable, which is the proper way to handle it according to the instructions.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the rules and constraints.\n\n**Strengths (What it does well):**\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption largely avoids emotional or speculative language. Descriptions like \"small, square, and uniformly white\" and \"cylindrical columns\" are perfectly objective.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and architectural features over any potential subject.\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** The paragraph flows logically from the general POV and environment to specific details, creating a clear and easy-to-read description.\n*   **Avoids Prohibited Terms:** It does not use words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"picture.\"\n*   **No Unseen Details:** It refrains from describing anything that is not visible, sticking to the facts of the scene.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, well-formed paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\n**Areas for Minor Improvement (Strict Adherence):**\n*   **Subjective Phrasing:** The phrase \"**feels** enclosed and expansive\" is a direct violation of the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The word \"feels\" introduces a subjective perception. A more objective alternative would be: \"The space is enclosed yet large...\"\n*   **Slightly Subjective Adjective:** The word \"**clean**\" in \"creating a clean, continuous appearance\" borders on subjective. While it can be used to mean \"unmarked,\" it can also imply a judgment. A more neutral alternative might be \"unmarked\" or \"uniform.\"\n*   **Redundancy:** The phrase \"**as if through the character’s eyes**\" is redundant after stating it is a \"first-person POV shot.\" The instruction asks for a \"concise\" description, and removing this clause would make it slightly more so without losing任何信息.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is of very high quality and is an excellent example of how to follow the provided instructions. The feedback نکات are minor refinements to achieve perfect adherence. By making the small adjustments suggested above (primarily removing \"feels\" and the redundant POV clause), the caption would be flawless.",
