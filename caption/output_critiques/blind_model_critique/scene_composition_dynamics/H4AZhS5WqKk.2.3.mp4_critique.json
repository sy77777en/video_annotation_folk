    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a well-lit, modern bedroom featuring a large bed with a textured dark green blanket, white pillows, and a beige upholstered headboard. The room includes a nightstand with a lamp and a vase of white flowers, and the floor is covered with a patterned beige carpet. A large window reveals a nighttime cityscape with illuminated buildings in the background. The environment is tidy and organized, with soft, neutral tones dominating the decor. An animated blue and gray cat with white markings and pink ears moves through the scene, interacting with the setting by leaping near the bed and pressing its hands against the window, creating the effect of smudges or streaks on the glass. The video combines live-action elements with animation, but no overlays such as text, icons, or subtitles are present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few minor issues that prevent it from perfectly adhering to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nAssuming the visual details described (colors, objects, actions) are present in the video, the caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting, time of day, key furniture, and the specific actions of the animated subject.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete, covering many of the required elements:\n*   **Setting:** Yes (indoors, modern bedroom).\n*   **Time of Day:** Yes (nighttime).\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Yes (bed, blanket, headboard, nightstand, flowers, carpet, window, cityscape).\n*   **Color, Material, Texture:** Yes (dark green, beige, textured, upholstered, patterned).\n*   **Motion:** Yes (cat leaping and pressing against the window).\n*   **Overlays:** Yes (mentions their absence).\n\nHowever, it is missing one key element explicitly requested by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption does not specify the POV (e.g., static shot, panning camera, first-person). This is a required detail that influences how the scene is perceived.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows most rules well but deviates from a few.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear picture of the scene without excessive length.\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** It does not use words like \"appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Avoids Emotional Language:** It uses descriptive adjectives (\"well-lit,\" \"modern,\" \"tidy\") rather than subjective ones (\"beautiful,\" \"cozy\").\n*   **Focus on Setting:** It successfully prioritizes the environment and its details.\n*   **Describes Motion:** It clearly explains the movement of the animated cat.\n\n**Where it could be improved:**\n*   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video takes place...\" which violates the rule to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The description should start directly with the scene itself.\n*   **Meta-Description:** The phrase \"The video combines live-action elements with animation\" is an explanation of the video's production technique, not a description of the scene. The instructions ask to describe what is visible, not how it was made. The presence of an animated cat in a realistic room is the description; explaining the technique is an inference about its creation.\n*   **Stating a Negative:** Mentioning that \"no overlays... are present\" is unnecessary. The instruction is to describe overlays *if they exist*. Stating their absence adds slight clutter and is not required.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that more closely follows all instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, an indoor nighttime scene is set in a well-lit, modern bedroom. The room features a large bed with a textured dark green blanket, white pillows, and a beige upholstered headboard. A nightstand beside the bed holds a lamp and a vase of white flowers, and the floor is covered by a patterned beige carpet. Through a large window, an illuminated cityscape is visible in the background. An animated blue and gray cat with white markings and pink ears moves through the tidy environment, leaping near the bed and pressing its paws against the window, which creates smudge-like streaks on the glass.",
