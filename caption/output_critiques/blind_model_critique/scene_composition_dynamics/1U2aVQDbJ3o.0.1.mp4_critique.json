    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV shot, showcases the vast expanse of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates. The setting is outdoors, featuring sweeping views of undulating sand dunes with a winding road cutting through the landscape. The time of day is likely midday, as the sunlight casts distinct shadows on the dunes, highlighting their curves and textures. The sand is a warm, golden-brown color, with smooth surfaces and occasional ridges. A vehicle is seen traveling along the road, leaving a trail of dust behind, emphasizing motion within the otherwise still desert environment. Overlay elements include text displaying \"LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates,\" centrally placed over the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and captures most of the required details effectively. However, it contains a few specific violations of the negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible scene. It correctly identifies the key elements: a drone shot over a desert, a road, a moving vehicle, and a text overlay. The descriptions of the sand dunes, their color, and the effect of the sunlight are visually precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive, successfully including all the major elements requested in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as a \"drone POV shot.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly states it is \"outdoors\" in the \"Liwa Desert, United Arab Emirates.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Describes the \"undulating sand dunes,\" \"winding road,\" and the sand's \"warm, golden-brown color\" and texture.\n*   **Motion:** Includes the movement of the \"vehicle... traveling along the road, leaving a trail of dust.\"\n*   **Overlays:** Correctly identifies the \"overlay elements\" and describes their content and placement.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has minor but clear issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery over the subject.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the overlay as a separate element.\n\n**Where it violates the instructions:**\n1.  **Avoid speculative statements:** The instruction says to avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options. The caption uses the phrase **\"likely midday,\"** which directly violates this rule. It should either state the time of day as a fact based on the visual evidence (e.g., \"The time of day is midday...\") or omit it if it cannot be stated with certainty.\n2.  **Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The instruction explicitly forbids this. The caption violates this rule three times:\n    *   \"...**showcases** the vast expanse...\" - The word \"showcases\" implies a purpose or an intent to highlight.\n    *   \"...**highlighting** their curves and textures.\" - This explains the *effect* of the sunlight, which is a form of interpretation.\n    *   \"...**emphasizing** motion...\" - This explains the *effect* of the dust trail, which is also a forbidden interpretation.\n\nA revised caption that strictly adheres to all instructions would look like this:\n\n**Corrected Example:**\nFrom a drone point of view, the video presents the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates. The outdoor setting consists of undulating, golden-brown sand dunes and a winding road. It is midday, and sunlight casts distinct shadows across the smooth and ridged surfaces of the sand. A vehicle travels along the road, creating a trail of dust. An overlay with the text \"LIWA Desert, United Arab Emirates\" is centrally placed on the screen.",
