    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a lush, green forest during the daytime. The environment is characterized by dense foliage and dappled sunlight filtering through the trees, creating a natural and serene backdrop. The scene features a person standing centrally, with a playful expression, as a burst of pink powder appears around them, suggesting a dynamic and lively moment. The person's dark clothing contrasts with the vibrant colors of the powder and the greenery, adding visual interest. The overall atmosphere is bright and energetic, with the natural elements and the colorful powder creating a vivid and engaging scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions. While it accurately describes the basic visual elements, it violates the rules against using subjective language, interpreting the scene, and speculating on the atmosphere or mood.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be factually accurate in its description of the core elements: an outdoor forest setting, daytime, a person, and a burst of pink powder. The details about dense foliage, dappled sunlight, and the person's dark clothing are consistent with a plausible scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it is missing a mandatory element from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions explicitly require stating the point of view (e.g., first-person, eye-level, drone shot), which is entirely omitted.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following significant ways:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption is filled with subjective and emotional language that the instructions forbid.\n    *   **Examples:** \"lush,\" \"serene,\" \"playful expression,\" \"dynamic and lively moment,\" \"vibrant colors,\" \"visual interest,\" \"bright and energetic,\" \"vivid and engaging scene.\" These words describe feelings, interpretations, and qualities rather than objective facts.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption speculates on the meaning and feeling of the event.\n    *   **Example:** \"...suggesting a dynamic and lively moment.\" This is an interpretation of the action, not a description of it.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The caption assigns a purpose to the environment.\n    *   **Example:** \"...creating a natural and serene backdrop.\" This explains the *function* of the forest in the scene, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption analyzes the visual composition and its effect on the viewer.\n    *   **Example:** \"...adding visual interest.\" This explains the *purpose* of the color contrast, which is interpretive. The final sentence, which describes the \"overall atmosphere\" and calls the scene \"vivid and engaging,\" is a summary of the scene's impact, which is also forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions\":** While the subject description is brief, mentioning a \"playful expression\" is a detailed, subjective observation about the person, which shifts focus away from a neutral, scene-based description.\n\n### Corrected Example Adhering to Instructions\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given rules for the same video:\n\nFrom an eye-level point of view, the outdoor scene is set within a forest during the daytime. The environment contains dense green foliage on the ground and on trees, with sunlight filtering through the canopy. A person in dark clothing stands in the center of the scene as a cloud of pink powder expands around them.",
