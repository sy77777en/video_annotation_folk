    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit hallway with light brown brick walls, a woman sits in partial shadow on a wooden bench. A single light source from above illuminates the wall beside her, highlighting a row of metal coat hooks. The hallway opens into a hazy or steamy locker room, where light filters through two high windows. Inside the room, a towel hangs from a rack over a long bench, upon which some bags are placed. A dark door with a small window is visible on the right side of the hallway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have just watched.\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the main elements of the scene, it lacks specificity and fails to capture the video's dynamic and atmospheric qualities. The description omits the static, eye-level point of view, which places the viewer as a silent observer in the hallway. It uses the ambiguous phrase \"hazy or steamy,\" whereas the video clearly shows thick steam billowing slowly from vents near the floor of the locker room, partially obscuring the back wall. The caption also misses key textural details, such as the rough, uneven surface of the light brown bricks and the damp, reflective sheen on the dark grey floor tiles. The description of \"some bags\" is too vague; the video shows a worn, dark brown leather duffel bag and a simple white canvas tote resting on the bench inside the locker room. Furthermore, the caption describes a static scene, failing to mention the subtle motion of the woman's chest rising and falling as she breathes or the gentle swirl of the steam, which are crucial for conveying that this is a video and not a still photograph. The description of the light source is also incomplete; the light from the right is not just from \"outside the door\" but is a harsh, cool-white fluorescent light that contrasts sharply with the warm, dim ambient light of the hallway itself.",
