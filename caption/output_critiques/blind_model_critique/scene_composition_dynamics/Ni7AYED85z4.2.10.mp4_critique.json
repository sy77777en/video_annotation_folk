To the left, the grey, choppy water of a canal extends into a foggy distance. To the right, a row of traditional, multi-story Venetian buildings in shades of cream and beige features arched windows and balconies, with some walls showing exposed brick.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions precisely.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is perfectly accurate. Every detail mentioned is clearly visible in the video.\n- **POV and Motion:** It correctly identifies the \"first-person POV\" and the \"walk\" along the promenade.\n- **Setting and Location:** \"Venice\" is the correct location, and \"wide, wet promenade\" accurately describes the environment.\n- **Weather and Time:** \"Overcast day\" is spot-on, and the \"foggy distance\" is visible.\n- **Visual Elements:** The descriptions of the canal water (\"grey, choppy\"), buildings (\"cream and beige,\" \"arched windows,\" \"exposed brick\"), ground (\"dark, stone-paved,\" \"reflective and damp\"), and the lamppost (\"ornate, dark green,\" \"pink-tinted lanterns\") are all precise and correct.\n- **Subjects:** The mention of \"a few people\" is accurate and correctly places them as minor elements within the scene.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, addressing all relevant aspects of the instructions.\n- It includes the point of view, environment, setting (both general and specific), time of day, and weather.\n- It details notable visual elements, describing their color, material, and features as instructed (e.g., the ornate lamppost, the texture of the buildings).\n- It correctly identifies the primary motion (the walk) and the secondary motion (choppy water).\n- It correctly omits any mention of overlays or scene transitions, as there are none.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows every rule and constraint flawlessly.\n- **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich, detailed description in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n- **Tone and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"gloomy\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n- **Focus:** The focus remains squarely on the setting and scenery, with subjects mentioned only in context, as required.\n- **Structure:** The description is logically organized, starting with the overall scene and POV, then moving to the major elements on the left and right, the ground, and finally focusing on the most prominent object (the lamppost).\n- **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n- **Inference:** It does not infer the purpose of the setting or explain what the scene emphasizes. It is purely descriptive.",
