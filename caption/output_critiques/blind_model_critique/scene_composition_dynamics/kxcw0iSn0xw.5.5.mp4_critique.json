    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting with a focus on a vibrant red diabolo spinning in mid-air. The background features a blurred, lush green environment, suggesting a natural, possibly park-like area. The diabolo is suspended by strings, and its smooth, rounded shape is highlighted against the greenery. In the progression of the video, blue paint splatters across the diabolo, creating a dynamic contrast with its red surface. The scene is well-lit, indicating daytime, and the paint's motion adds a sense of energy and change to the otherwise static surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it accurately identifies the main subject and action, it violates the rules against using speculative, subjective, and interpretive language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption states the background is \"suggesting a natural, possibly park-like area.\" The words \"suggesting\" and \"possibly\" are speculative and are explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption includes several interpretive phrases.\n    *   \"...its smooth, rounded shape is **highlighted** against the greenery.\" This explains a visual effect rather than just describing the scene.\n    *   \"...**creating a dynamic contrast** with its red surface.\" This describes the *effect* of the colors, which is an interpretation.\n    *   \"...the paint's motion **adds a sense of energy and change**...\" This is a purely subjective interpretation of the action's impact on the viewer.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses words like \"**vibrant** red,\" \"**lush** green,\" and \"**dynamic** contrast.\" These adjectives are subjective and should be avoided in favor of more neutral descriptions. The phrase \"**well-lit**\" is also subjective.\n*   **Incompleteness:** The caption does not mention the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot focused on the subject.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the setting, time of day, and the central action. However, it repeatedly breaks the core rules by interpreting the scene, speculating about the location, and using subjective language instead of providing a purely objective and descriptive account.",
