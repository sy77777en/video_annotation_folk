    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that effectively follows the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes the visual elements, their properties, and the animation sequence.\n*   **Visuals:** It correctly identifies the \"stylized atom-like structure,\" its components (\"central nucleus,\" \"orbiting spheres\"), colors (\"pink,\" \"light blue,\" \"orange\"), and texture (\"textured orange spheres\").\n*   **Animation:** The description of the motion is perfect. It accurately captures the progression from a single element that \"replicates, expanding into a grid,\" which then \"continues to multiply\" into a \"repeating, tiled pattern.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes the relevant details requested in the instructions while correctly omitting those that are not applicable.\n*   **Setting:** It correctly identifies the setting as a \"solid black background\" or \"black void,\" which is appropriate for an abstract animation.\n*   **Visual Elements:** The description of the structure's color, shape, and texture is detailed and informative, as instructed.\n*   **Motion and Transitions:** The caption excels at describing the dynamic nature of the video. It clearly explains the transition from a single object to a full-screen pattern.\n*   **Point of View:** While not explicitly stated with a term like \"front-on view,\" the description of the object being \"centered\" and the grid \"filling the entire view\" implies a direct, static viewpoint, which is sufficient for this type of abstract scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption strictly adheres to all stylistic and negative constraints.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. The paragraph is coherent and flows logically from the initial state to the final one.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective words (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"mesmerizing\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it seems to be\").\n*   **Focus:** The description remains focused on the setting and scenery (the animated pattern) rather than inferring a purpose or narrative.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required. It also correctly avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and comprehensive, capturing the key visual information and the full sequence of motion in a single, well-written paragraph. There are no significant areas for improvement.",
