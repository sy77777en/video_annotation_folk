    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good, but it can be improved for better adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate. All the elements mentioned—the calm, murky water, the eroded dirt bank, the vegetation, and the white bird with a yellow beak—are correctly identified and described as they appear in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the setting, time of day, and key visual elements.\n*   **Minor Omission:** It fails to mention the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot.\n*   **Minor Omission:** It does not describe the subtle motion in the scene. The bird makes small movements with its head, and there are very gentle ripples on the water. Describing the scene as almost completely still would add more detail.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery over the subject.\n    *   It avoids emotional, subjective, and speculative language.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It accurately describes the color, material, and features of the elements (e.g., \"eroded dirt bank,\" \"white bird with a long neck and a yellow beak\").\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Redundancy:** The caption begins by stating the scene is \"during the day\" and ends with \"The lighting suggests it is daytime.\" The final sentence is redundant and should be removed to improve conciseness.\n    *   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption starts with \"The video shows...\" While not explicitly forbidden, the instructions favor a more direct descriptive style. A stronger start would be to launch directly into the scene's description (e.g., \"An outdoor scene set during the day features...\").\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the feedback to better align with the instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level perspective, an outdoor scene is set during the day at the edge of a body of calm, murky water that reflects the environment. A steep, eroded dirt bank with exposed soil layers lines the water, with dry, brown grass and sparse green vegetation growing along its top edge. In the shallow water near the bank, a large, white bird with a long neck and a yellow beak stands nearly still, its reflection visible on the water's surface.",
