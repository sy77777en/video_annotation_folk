    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit atmosphere. The environment features a wooden surface cluttered with various items, including a dark, rectangular box with a latch. The walls have a textured appearance, possibly made of wood or a similar material, with a pattern of circular openings allowing light to filter through, creating a dappled effect. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the cozy ambiance. The scene includes a figure interacting with the box, adding a sense of curiosity and engagement. The overall color palette is earthy, with deep browns, greens, and hints of vibrant colors from surrounding fabrics.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption captures the general atmosphere but misses several key requirements and specific visual details. It fails to identify the point of view, which is a close-up, top-down perspective focusing on a pair of hands interacting with the box, immersing the viewer directly in the activity. The caption uses subjective and emotional language such as \"warm,\" \"cozy ambiance,\" and \"sense of curiosity,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions; for example, the lighting is low and yellow-toned, casting distinct shadows. The phrase \"possibly made of wood\" is speculative and should be replaced with a definitive description of the material's visible features, such as \"walls made of dark bamboo panels with circular cutouts.\" The description of the box is too generic; it is a dark-stained wooden chest with tarnished brass fittings and an intricate carving on its lid. Furthermore, the motion is only vaguely implied; the caption should explicitly state that hands enter the scene to unfasten the metal latch and slowly lift the lid. Finally, the description omits a key overlay: a semi-transparent channel watermark present in the bottom-right corner throughout the video.",
