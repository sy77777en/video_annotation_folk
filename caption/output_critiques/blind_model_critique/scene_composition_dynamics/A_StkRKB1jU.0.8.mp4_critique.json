The space is characterized by high ceilings and is lined with large, light-colored stone pillars.

A row of rectangular, lantern-style light fixtures hangs from the ceiling, supplementing the natural light. Along the right side of the hall are dark wooden teller counters and desks.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is very good but could be improved with one key addition.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a \"long, grand hallway of an institutional building,\" which appropriately avoids specific and speculative labels like \"bank\" or \"courthouse.\"\n*   Details about the architecture (high ceilings, stone pillars), flooring (polished, light-colored tile), and lighting (sunlight from windows, hanging fixtures) are precise and factually correct.\n*   The description of the subjects (\"figures wearing suits and masks\") and their action (\"running\") is accurate and adheres to the instruction of keeping subject details minimal.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully includes the setting, time of day, environment, and notable visual elements as requested.\n*   **Missing Element:** The caption fails to mention the **point of view** and the **camera's motion**. The instructions state to \"indicate the point of view\" and \"describe human-made movements.\" While it describes the figures' movement, it omits that the camera is also moving through the space, which is a crucial element of how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption excels at following the negative constraints. It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple English, and avoids emotional/subjective adjectives, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"). It correctly focuses on the setting over the subjects.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The only deviation from the instructions is the omission of the camera's movement, which is a key part of describing the overall scene and how it unfolds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy and adherence to most rules. Its primary weakness is incompleteness due to the omission of the camera's point of view and motion. Adding a phrase to describe the camera's movement would make it fully compliant with the instructions.\n\n**Example of an improved caption:**\n\nFrom a moving, eye-level point of view, the scene takes place during the day inside a long, grand hallway of an institutional building. The space is characterized by high ceilings and is lined with large, light-colored stone pillars. Sunlight streams through tall windows on the left, casting bright patches and long shadows across a polished, light-colored tiled floor. A row of rectangular, lantern-style light fixtures hangs from the ceiling, supplementing the natural light. Along the right side of the hall are dark wooden teller counters and desks.
