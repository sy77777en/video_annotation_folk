    "pre_caption": "The scene takes place on a brightly lit soccer field with vibrant green turf marked by a thick white line. Two players are shown in close proximity. One player wears a white sleeveless jersey with the number \"7\" in black, accented with black and blue details, over a black long-sleeved undershirt. The other player, positioned behind the first, is in a red sleeveless jersey with the number \"18\" in black, also worn over a black long-sleeved undershirt. Both jerseys feature a small, triangular yellow and green logo on the chest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have imagined.\n\nThe caption accurately describes the players' jerseys and their proximity but misses several key contextual and dynamic elements from the video. It fails to specify the low-angle, close-up point of view that focuses on the players' legs and torso, which creates a sense of immediate, on-field action. The description of the setting as a \"brightly lit soccer field\" is too general; it should specify that the scene occurs at night under powerful stadium floodlights, which cast sharp shadows on the vibrant green turf. The caption omits the dynamic motion central to the video: the player in the white jersey is actively dribbling a white and black soccer ball while the player in the red jersey defensively shadows their movements along the sideline. Furthermore, the description neglects to mention the out-of-focus background, where the stadium stands filled with a blurred crowd are visible, adding to the atmosphere of a professional match. Finally, it completely misses the broadcast overlay in the top-left corner, which displays a live score and a match timer, an essential visual element mentioned in the instructions.",
