    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a dimly lit restaurant, featuring a table set for a meal. The environment is characterized by a warm, subdued ambiance with dark wooden elements and traditional decor. The table is covered with a white tablecloth and adorned with plates of food, including a dish with noodles and vegetables, and a glass of iced tea. The lighting casts soft shadows, enhancing the intimate atmosphere. The scene includes individuals seated at the table, engaged in dining, with chopsticks in hand. The overall composition suggests a calm, focused dining experience, with the restaurant's decor and table setting providing a cohesive backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to follow several key negative constraints and omits required information.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the visual content matches the description (an indoor restaurant, a table with food), the factual details like \"white tablecloth,\" \"noodles and vegetables,\" and \"glass of iced tea\" are likely accurate. However, the caption's overall accuracy is compromised by its heavy use of subjective interpretation, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete and misses several required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** The instruction explicitly asks to indicate the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld). The caption completely omits this.\n*   **Time of Day:** This is not mentioned. While \"dimly lit\" might suggest evening, the instruction requires stating the time of day if it can be determined.\n*   **Motion:** The caption mentions people are \"engaged in dining\" but fails to describe any specific motion, such as the movement of chopsticks, steam rising from food, or subtle shifts in posture, which are key components of a video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates multiple negative constraints:\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption is filled with subjective language.\n    *   **Examples:** \"warm, subdued ambiance,\" \"intimate atmosphere,\" \"calm, focused dining experience.\" These words describe feelings and interpretations, not objective visual facts.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses speculative phrasing.\n    *   **Example:** \"The overall composition suggests a calm, focused dining experience...\" The instruction explicitly forbids words like \"suggests\" and any form of speculation.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The caption explains the *effect* of the visual elements instead of just describing them.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...lighting casts soft shadows, **enhancing the intimate atmosphere**\" and \"...decor and table setting **providing a cohesive backdrop**.\" These phrases explain the purpose and impact of the elements, which is forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Concise\":** The caption includes redundant phrasing like \"The video depicts...\" and uses flowery language (\"adorned with plates of food\") instead of simple, direct descriptions.\n\nIn summary, the caption reads more like a subjective review or a creative interpretation of the scene rather than the objective, factual description required by the instructions. It fails by including forbidden subjective content while omitting mandatory objective details like point of view and motion.",
