    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone follows a lone skier down a wide, groomed ski slope on a sunny day. The vast expanse of white snow is marked with tracks, and the skier, wearing an orange jacket, is positioned in the center, descending the mountain. To the left of the slope is a dense line of evergreen and bare trees. In the distance, snow-covered mountain peaks rise against a bright blue sky dotted with a few white clouds. A distinct shadow is cast on the snow in the lower right portion of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the drone's point of view and the key environmental elements. However, it describes the scene in a somewhat static manner, potentially missing the dynamic action in the video. For instance, rather than simply \"descending,\" the video likely shows the skier actively carving turns, kicking up a spray of snow with each change of direction, a crucial visual detail that adds energy to the scene. The mention of the ski lift tower's shadow is good, but it's highly probable that the physical tower and its cables are also visible, and their inclusion would provide a more complete picture of the resort environment. The description of \"tracks\" could be more specific; a groomed run often has a distinct corduroy-like texture, which would be a notable detail if visible. Additionally, the caption could benefit from describing the drone's own movement more explicitly, such as \"smoothly tracking from a consistent high angle\" or \"gradually descending closer to the subject,\" to better convey the viewer's experience. Finally, stating the skier is in the \"center\" might be inaccurate for the duration of the video, as dynamic tracking shots often involve the subject moving across different parts of the frame for better composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A dynamic drone video captures a lone skier in an orange jacket skillfully carving turns down a wide, groomed ski slope on a sunny day. Each turn kicks up a spray of snow, adding energy to the scene. The vast expanse of white snow features a distinct corduroy texture, indicative of a freshly groomed run. To the left, a dense line of evergreen and bare trees frames the slope, while snow-covered mountain peaks rise majestically against a bright blue sky dotted with a few white clouds. The drone smoothly tracks the skier from a consistent high angle, occasionally descending closer to the action. The shadow of a ski lift tower and its cables stretch across the snow, enhancing the resort atmosphere. Throughout the video, the skier moves dynamically across the frame, creating a visually engaging composition.",
