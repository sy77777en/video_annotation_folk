    "pre_caption": "The video shows an outdoor scene at what appears to be a sports facility, possibly a tennis club or stadium, under an overcast sky. A young woman with long dark hair, wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts, and carrying a black bag, walks down a set of concrete stairs. The stairs are flanked by white metal railings and lead down to a sloping grassy area. In the background, there is a tiered seating structure with a green-painted facade and a large, covered roof supported by metal beams. Part of a building with large windows is visible further in the background, and a tall tree stands to the left. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by greens and greys.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have just watched.\n\nThe caption's use of speculative language like \"appears to be\" and \"possibly\" is unnecessary, as the video clearly shows a green tennis court with white line markings in the background, confirming the setting is a tennis facility. The description omits the point of view, which is a static, medium shot from a slightly elevated position, looking down toward the subject. While the caption mentions the \"tiered seating structure,\" it could be more specific by noting the visible dark green plastic seats within the gray concrete tiers. The \"black bag\" the woman carries is identifiable as a tennis racket bag, a detail that would strengthen the scene's context. Furthermore, the description fails to mention a semi-transparent watermark for a sports channel logo located in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Finally, the description of motion is minimal; it could be improved by noting that the camera pans slightly to the right, following the woman's descent, and that the leaves on the tall tree are rustling gently in a light breeze.",
