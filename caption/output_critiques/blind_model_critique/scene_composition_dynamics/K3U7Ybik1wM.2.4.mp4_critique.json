The central focus is a large, dark blue range cooker with two round, chrome-covered hotplates and a striped tea towel hanging from its handle. The cooker is set between light green cabinets with curved drawer fronts and wooden countertops. The wall behind the stove is covered in a backsplash of white, wavy subway tiles.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good overall, but there are a few minor areas where it deviates from the specific instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption appears to be highly accurate in its description of the objects, colors, materials, and layout of the kitchen scene. I cannot verify this without seeing the video, but the level of detail is specific and concrete.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully includes the point of view, the indoor setting, the time of day, and the primary motion of the camera (\"tilts upward\").\n*   It thoroughly describes notable visual elements (cooker, cabinets, countertops, backsplash, window, hood, floor) and their features (color, material, shape, texture).\n*   It correctly omits details on subjects, overlays, or scene transitions, assuming they are not present in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Clarity:** It uses simple, natural English and is easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional language and speculation (e.g., \"might be,\" \"appears\").\n    *   **Detail:** It provides specific details about materials, colors, and shapes as requested (e.g., \"dark blue range cooker,\" \"white, wavy subway tiles,\" \"large, irregular stone tiles\").\n    *   **Core Elements:** It correctly identifies the POV, setting, time of day, and motion.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes\":** The phrase **\"The central focus is...\"** directly violates the instruction, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" It interprets the shot's composition rather than simply describing it. A more compliant alternative would be: \"Positioned centrally is a large, dark blue range cooker...\"\n    *   **Slightly Inferential Language:** The phrase **\"as if through the character’s eyes\"** is a minor inference. The instruction states, \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" While it clarifies the first-person POV, it assumes the existence of a \"character.\" Simply stating \"A first-person POV shot\" is sufficient and more strictly adheres to the rule.\n    *   **Use of a Subjective Adjective:** The word **\"rustic\"** is a stylistic and somewhat subjective adjective, which the instructions advise against (\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\"). While it's a common descriptor for a style, the caption already does an excellent job of describing the elements that create that style (wooden countertops, stone tiles). Removing \"rustic\" would make the description more objective.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of how the caption could be revised to perfectly align with all instructions:\n\nA first-person POV shot tilts upward within a kitchen during the daytime. Positioned centrally is a large, dark blue range cooker with two round, chrome-covered hotplates and a striped tea towel hanging from its handle. The cooker is set between light green cabinets with curved drawer fronts and wooden countertops. The wall behind it is covered in a backsplash of white, wavy subway tiles. To the right, a window with a striped Roman blind looks out onto a green lawn. A stainless steel extractor hood is visible above the range, and the floor is made of large, irregular stone tiles.",
