    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor urban setting during the daytime, featuring a street lined with bare trees and classic buildings. The scene is viewed from an objective perspective, focusing on a vintage Oldsmobile car with a dark, glossy finish. The car is positioned prominently in the foreground, with its chrome details and distinctive emblem visible. The street is populated with other vehicles, suggesting a typical city environment. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a neutral light over the scene. Overlay elements include the text \"Malcolm X (1992)\" in white, positioned at the bottom right, indicating the video's title and year.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few minor and one significant area for improvement. It successfully captures the core visual information but slightly deviates from the strict constraints of the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption appears to be accurate. It describes a plausible scene with specific, verifiable details like the make of the car (Oldsmobile), its features (dark, glossy, chrome), the setting (urban street, bare trees), the time of day, and the exact content and placement of the text overlay. All elements described are concrete and objective.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThis is the weakest aspect of the caption.\n\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption fails to describe any **motion or changes**, which is a key requirement for describing a video. It portrays the scene as a static photograph. The instruction explicitly asks to describe \"human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway.\" The caption should clarify if the Oldsmobile is parked or moving, and whether the other vehicles are in motion or stationary. This is a critical piece of information missing for a video description.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres well to most rules but violates a few important ones.\n\n**Strengths (What it does well):**\n\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Core Elements:** It correctly includes the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and weather.\n*   **Object Description:** The description of the Oldsmobile is excellent, following the instruction to detail its color, material, and distinguishing features (\"dark, glossy finish,\" \"chrome details,\" \"distinctive emblem\").\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay element\" and describes its content, color, and position, as instructed.\n*   **Tone:** It successfully avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives.\n\n**Weaknesses (Where it deviates):**\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer\":** The phrase \"**suggesting** a typical city environment\" is a minor inference. The instruction states to avoid speculative statements and not to infer the role of the setting. A better phrasing would be to simply state the facts: \"The street is populated with other vehicles.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes\":** The phrases \"**focusing on** a vintage Oldsmobile car\" and \"**positioned prominently** in the foreground\" violate this rule. The caption should describe the car's placement neutrally (e.g., \"A vintage Oldsmobile car is in the foreground\") rather than explaining the shot's compositional focus.\n*   **Vague Point of View:** While \"objective perspective\" is mentioned, it is a general term. A more precise description like \"eye-level shot\" or \"low-angle shot\" would be more informative and better align with the instruction's goal of providing a clear visual description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong attempt that correctly identifies and describes most key visual elements according to the instructions. However, its failure to describe any motion is a significant flaw for a video description. Additionally, it includes minor instances of inference and emphasis that are explicitly forbidden by the rules. To be perfect, it would need to incorporate motion and rephrase a few sentences to be more neutral and descriptive rather than interpretive.",
