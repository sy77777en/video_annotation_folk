    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting with a crowd of abstract, monochromatic figures gathered in an open area. The figures are uniformly white and lack detailed features, giving them a sculptural appearance. They are positioned on a dark surface, possibly asphalt, which contrasts with their pale color. The environment is defined by a series of barriers and a camera on a tripod, suggesting an organized event or gathering. The background is dark, with minimal architectural elements visible, creating a stark and focused atmosphere. The scene is static, with no visible weather conditions or time of day indicated.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the core subject of abstract, monochromatic figures in an outdoor area. However, it misses several key visual details and mischaracterizes the scene's dynamics. It fails to specify the low-angle point of view and the slow, continuous panning motion of the camera, incorrectly stating the scene is \"static.\" The description of the environment could be more precise; the \"dark surface\" is a polished, reflective black floor that mirrors the figures, and the \"barriers\" are specifically red velvet ropes on chrome stanchions. A major omission is the lighting: the scene is illuminated by harsh, directional spotlights from above, which cast long, dramatic shadows and are essential to the visual composition. Consequently, the caption is incorrect in stating that the time of day is not indicated, as the artificial lighting and dark background clearly establish a nighttime setting. The use of \"possibly asphalt\" is speculative and should be avoided. Furthermore, the caption neglects to mention a semi-transparent watermark with an artist's signature, an overlay element visible in the bottom-right corner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an outdoor setting featuring a crowd of abstract, monochromatic figures gathered in an open area. These uniformly white, sculptural figures are positioned on a polished, reflective black floor that mirrors their forms. The scene is viewed from a low-angle perspective, with the camera executing a slow, continuous panning motion. Red velvet ropes on chrome stanchions define the space, suggesting an organized event. The environment is dramatically lit by harsh, directional spotlights from above, casting long shadows and establishing a nighttime setting. The background remains dark, with minimal architectural elements, enhancing the stark and focused atmosphere. A semi-transparent watermark with an artist's signature is visible in the bottom-right corner, adding an overlay element to the composition.",
