    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a small, narrow indoor room with blue walls and a wooden floor. The room is lit by a soft, ambient light coming from a window near the ceiling, suggesting a time of day with natural light, possibly morning or afternoon. The notable visual element is a large, white cube with black circular markings resembling a die, positioned centrally on the floor. The cube appears solid and smooth. As the video progresses, the cube is shown to have broken apart into smaller, irregularly shaped pieces scattered across the floor, revealing a wooden texture inside. The scene maintains a minimalist style with no additional furniture or decorations. Overlay elements include a white circular icon at the center of the screen, which is not part of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to most of the instructions, but it has a few specific violations that prevent it from being perfect.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is very good. It is concise, informative, and accurately captures the key visual elements and the progression of the scene. It successfully avoids emotional language and focuses on objective description. However, it fails on the strict \"no speculation\" rule and misses one key piece of information.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the room's features (blue walls, wood floor), the central object (white cube/die), its transformation (breaking apart), and the overlay element (white icon).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one required element:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly ask for the POV (e.g., first-person, static shot, drone shot). The caption does not mention this, leaving out how the viewer perceives the scene (e.g., is the camera stationary, is it handheld, is it at eye-level?).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows most rules well, but violates a few important ones:\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **No \"Image/Frame\":** It correctly avoids these terms.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It focuses on the setting and the main object, not on any subjects.\n*   **Simple Language:** The English is clear and natural.\n*   **Describes Overlays:** It correctly identifies the icon as an overlay and describes it.\n*   **Describes Motion/Change:** It clearly explains the transition of the cube from whole to broken.\n\n**Where it violates the instructions:**\n*   **Speculative Language:** The instructions state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The caption violates this rule multiple times:\n    *   \"...**suggesting** a time of day with natural light, **possibly** morning or afternoon.\" This is both speculative (\"suggesting\") and presents an ambiguous option (\"morning or afternoon\").\n    *   \"The cube **appears** solid and smooth.\" This uses the forbidden word \"appears.\"\n\n*   **Subjective Language (Minor Violation):** The instructions say to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   \"The scene maintains a **minimalist style**...\" While \"minimalist\" is a common design term, it can be considered a subjective interpretation of the scene's style. A more objective description would be to simply state that the room contains no other furniture or decorations, which the caption also does.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nTo make the caption fully compliant with the instructions, the speculative language should be removed and the point of view should be added.\n\n**Example of an improved, fully compliant caption:**\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the video shows a small, narrow indoor room with blue walls and a wooden floor, illuminated by natural light from a window near the ceiling. A large, solid white cube with black circular markings is positioned in the center of the floor. The scene then changes to show the cube broken into smaller, irregularly shaped pieces scattered across the floor, revealing an interior wooden texture. The room contains no other furniture or decorations. A white circular icon is present as an overlay in the center of the screen.",
