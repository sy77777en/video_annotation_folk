    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

Far below, the faint streaks of red and white lights indicate traffic moving along a city street. A person hangs in the foreground, suspended in the space between the buildings against the backdrop of the nocturnal cityscape.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and masterfully adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a dense city at night, the high-angle point of view, the framing by skyscrapers, the grid of lit windows on the right, the distant urban glow, the light streaks from traffic below, and the suspended person in the foreground. Every detail mentioned is present and correctly described.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive without being verbose. It successfully includes all the required elements:\n    *   **Point of View:** \"high above a dense city\" clearly establishes the viewer's perspective.\n    *   **Setting & Environment:** \"dense city,\" \"towering skyscrapers,\" and \"city street\" effectively describe the outdoor, urban environment.\n    *   **Time of Day:** \"at night\" and \"nocturnal cityscape\" are stated clearly.\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** The buildings, windows (\"bright, square\"), and traffic lights (\"red and white streaks\") are described with their key features.\n    *   **Motion:** The movement of traffic is correctly noted (\"traffic moving\").\n    *   **Subjects:** The person is described with perfect context and placement (\"hangs in the foreground, suspended\") without excessive detail, fulfilling the instruction to have the subject complement the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the negative and positive constraints perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery, as requested.\n    *   It avoids speculative language (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), emotional adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"lonely\"), and forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\").\n    *   It does not infer the role of the setting or explain what the scene emphasizes.\n    *   There are no overlays or scene transitions in the video, so their omission from the caption is correct.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, objective, and paints a clear picture of the video's content.",
