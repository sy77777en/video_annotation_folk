    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot of a snowy outdoor setting, likely a winter landscape. The scene features a snow-covered road flanked by tall snowbanks on either side, with a dense forest of evergreen trees in the background. The sky is overcast, suggesting a cold, cloudy day. The road shows tracks from previous vehicles, indicating recent activity. The viewer's perspective includes parts of a sled or similar vehicle, with visible handlebars and footrests, suggesting motion along the snowy path. The environment is serene, with the white snow contrasting against the dark green of the trees, creating a stark, wintry atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the scene, but it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding speculation and subjective language.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes the core visual elements: a first-person view, a snowy road, snowbanks, evergreen trees, an overcast sky, and parts of a vehicle. The description of the physical environment is factually correct based on the text.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully includes most of the required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"first-person POV.\"\n*   **Setting:** Clearly described as a \"snowy outdoor setting\" with a road and forest.\n*   **Time of Day / Weather:** Correctly noted as a \"cloudy day\" with an \"overcast\" sky.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Mentions the snow, trees, road tracks, and parts of the vehicle.\n\nHowever, it is weak on describing motion. It \"suggests motion\" but does not state whether the scene is static or in motion, which is a critical detail.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues. It violates several explicit rules.\n\n**Violations:**\n\n*   **Speculative Language:** The instructions state to avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or 'there might be.'\n    *   `\"...likely a winter landscape.\"` - The word \"likely\" is speculative. \"Snowy outdoor setting\" is sufficient.\n    *   `\"...suggesting a cold, cloudy day.\"` - \"Overcast sky\" is a fact; \"cold\" is an inference, and \"suggesting\" is a speculative word.\n    *   `\"...indicating recent activity.\"` - The tracks are a fact; what they *indicate* is an inference.\n    *   `\"...suggesting motion along the snowy path.\"` - The presence of vehicle parts does not inherently mean motion is occurring. If the video shows movement, it should be stated directly (e.g., \"The view moves forward\"). If not, this is speculation.\n\n*   **Ambiguous Options:** The instructions state to avoid options like 'A or B.'\n    *   `\"...sled or similar vehicle...\"` - This is an ambiguous option. The caption should describe only what is visible (e.g., \"handlebars and footrests\") without trying to definitively name the vehicle.\n\n*   **Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state to avoid these.\n    *   `\"The environment is serene...\"` - \"Serene\" is a subjective, emotional adjective.\n    *   `\"...creating a stark, wintry atmosphere.\"` - \"Stark\" is subjective, and describing an \"atmosphere\" is an interpretation, not a direct observation.\n\n*   **Introductory Text:** The instructions state to return only the one-paragraph description without introductory text.\n    *   `\"The video presents...\"` - This is introductory phrasing that should be omitted.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that strictly follows all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, the scene is an outdoor, snow-covered road flanked by tall snowbanks and a dense forest of evergreen trees under an overcast sky. Tracks from a vehicle are visible in the snow on the road. In the lower portion of the view are the handlebars and footrests of the vehicle from which the scene is recorded. The perspective moves forward along the path, traveling down the center of the road.",
