    "pre_caption": "The video is set outdoors during the daytime under bright sunlight. The scene consists of a muddy area with uneven, thick brown mud forming mounds and depressions. Shallow puddles of murky water are scattered throughout the mud. A single lapwing, characterized by its grey and white feathers, black wing markings, long thin legs, and yellow facial features including the beak, is seen walking across this muddy terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview but lacks the specific detail needed to accurately represent the scene. It fails to mention the point of view, which is a steady, ground-level shot that immerses the viewer in the environment. The description of the lapwing is too general and potentially inaccurate; the \"yellow facial features\" are not visible, and instead, the bird has a prominent, thin black crest on its head, an iridescent green and purple sheen on its dark upper feathers, and a black beak, none of which are mentioned. The action is understated as just \"walking,\" whereas the lapwing is actively foraging, periodically stopping to probe the soft mud with its beak. Furthermore, the description of the environment could be enhanced by noting the glistening texture of the wet mud under the bright sun and the sparse, green reeds growing at the edges of the murky puddles, which add important context to the habitat.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a steady, ground-level shot that immerses the viewer in a sunlit, outdoor scene. The terrain is a muddy expanse with uneven, thick brown mud forming mounds and depressions, glistening under the bright sunlight. Shallow puddles of murky water are scattered throughout, bordered by sparse, green reeds that hint at the habitat's natural setting. A single lapwing, distinguished by its thin black crest, iridescent green and purple sheen on its dark upper feathers, and black beak, is actively foraging. It moves across the muddy landscape, periodically stopping to probe the soft mud with its beak, adding a dynamic element to the scene.",
