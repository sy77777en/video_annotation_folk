    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a scene in a vast, snow-covered landscape during the daytime. A winding track is carved through the deep white snow, bordered in the distance by a sparse forest of evergreen trees. The low sun casts a bright glare across the scene. A white vehicle drifts around a curve on the track, kicking up a large, dense cloud of powdered snow that follows in its wake. Further down the curved path, another vehicle is visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the detailed instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and written in a clear, objective style.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. All the elements mentioned—a drone shot, a snowy landscape, a track, a drifting car kicking up snow, a low sun, and a second vehicle—fit together logically to create a coherent and believable picture of the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very thorough and includes all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"filmed by a drone.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Clearly described as \"a vast, snow-covered landscape\" (outdoors) with a \"sparse forest of evergreen trees.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Specifies \"daytime\" and notes the lighting condition: \"The low sun casts a bright glare.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It details the \"winding track carved through the deep white snow\" and the \"large, dense cloud of powdered snow.\"\n*   **Subjects & Motion:** It describes the primary action (\"A white vehicle drifts around a curve... kicking up... snow\") and the placement of a secondary subject (\"another vehicle is visible in the background\") without excessive detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels at following the specific constraints of the prompt:\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that flows logically from the general setting to specific actions.\n*   **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"exciting\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It prioritizes the setting and the vehicle's interaction with it, rather than focusing on the vehicle itself, as instructed.\n*   **No Inferences:** It describes \"a winding track\" without inferring its purpose (e.g., \"a racetrack\" or \"a practice course\").\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement\nThe opening phrase, \"A video filmed by a drone captures a scene in...\" is slightly redundant and feels like introductory text, which the instructions advise against. A more direct and integrated opening would be a small improvement, for example: \"From a drone's point of view, a vast, snow-covered landscape unfolds during the daytime.\"\n\n**Overall, the caption is of very high quality and demonstrates a strong understanding of all the requirements. The feedback for improvement is minor and does not detract from the caption's overall effectiveness.**",
