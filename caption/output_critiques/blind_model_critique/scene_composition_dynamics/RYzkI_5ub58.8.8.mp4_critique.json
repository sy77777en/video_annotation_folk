    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but contains specific violations of the instructions. It successfully captures the main subject and visual style but fails to adhere to some key negative constraints.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the visual content. It correctly identifies the subject as a lizard, its coloration (\"gray and brown\"), its texture (\"textured,\" \"bumpy\"), its position (\"centered,\" \"head-on\"), and the state of the background (\"out of focus,\" \"muted, earthy tones\"). The description of the lighting and its effect on the lizard's skin is also visually accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete according to the instructions.\n*   **Point of View:** Included (\"A close-up, head-on view\").\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Included (\"natural, outdoor environment\").\n*   **Time of Day:** Included (\"during the day\").\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Included (lizard's scales, snout, brow ridges).\n*   **Color & Texture:** Included (\"gray and brown,\" \"textured,\" \"bumpy\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has issues.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is a single, concise paragraph.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the scenery and subject's context rather than excessive detail.\n*   It correctly identifies the subject's placement (\"centered\").\n\n**Violations:**\n1.  **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The instruction states to avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or 'there might be.' The phrase \"**suggests** a natural, outdoor environment\" is a form of speculation. It infers the setting from the out-of-focus background rather than stating what is clearly visible. A better approach would be to simply describe the background colors without interpreting them.\n2.  **Do Not Explain What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** The instruction explicitly forbids this. The last sentence, \"The lighting **highlights** the intricate, bumpy texture of the lizard's skin,\" directly violates this rule by explaining the *effect* of the lighting. It should describe the visual facts without interpreting their purpose or emphasis.\n3.  **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The word \"**intricate**\" can be considered a subjective adjective, although it is a minor violation.\n\n### Corrected Example\nFor comparison, here is a version of the caption that adheres more strictly to all instructions:\n\nA close-up, head-on view shows a lizard with textured, gray and brown scales. The creature's head is centered in the shot, and its eyes face forward. The background is out of focus with muted, earthy tones. The scene is set outdoors during the day, with direct lighting revealing the bumpy texture on the lizard's snout and prominent brow ridges.",
