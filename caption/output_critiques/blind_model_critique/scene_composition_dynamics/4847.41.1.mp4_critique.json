    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a maritime scene set on a calm body of water during the day. The setting features a small rowboat with several individuals, initially seen from a distance and later approaching a larger ship. The water is smooth, and the lighting suggests a clear day, casting a warm, sepia tone over the scene. The larger ship is visible with ropes and rigging, indicating a traditional sailing vessel. The transition from a distant view of the rowboat to a closer interaction with the ship highlights the movement across the water, emphasizing the nautical environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\n*A static, third-person shot from a low angle, as if filmed from another boat. The sky is heavily overcast with a flat, white light. The video is in black and white with a noticeable sepia/yellow tint in the bright areas, like the sky and water reflections, giving it an aged, archival look. The first shot is a wide view of a small wooden rowboat, occupied by three men in dark, simple sailor-like attire, rowing across a calm sea with gentle swells. In the distance is a large, two-masted wooden schooner with its sails furled. There is a hard cut to a medium shot, now closer to the schooner. The rowboat is pulling alongside the ship's dark, weathered wooden hull, where rope ladders and thick mooring lines are visible hanging down.*\n\nThe caption omits the specific point of view, which appears to be a static, third-person shot from a low angle near the water's surface. It fails to describe the weather conditions beyond the calm water, missing the crucial detail of a bright, overcast sky that contributes to the scene's flat lighting. The description of the visual style as \"white areas having a sepia-colored tone\" is slightly awkward; \"a black-and-white scene with sepia-toned highlights\" would be more precise. The caption's description of the transition is interpretive rather than descriptive; it should state that a hard cut shifts the perspective from a distant wide shot to a closer medium shot, rather than vaguely mentioning an \"approach\" that \"highlights the movement.\" The description of the ship as a \"traditional sailing vessel\" is too general, as the video clearly shows a two-masted wooden schooner with furled sails. Finally, the concluding phrase \"emphasizing the nautical environment\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's purpose, which violates the instruction to avoid explaining what the scene highlights.",
