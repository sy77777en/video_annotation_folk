    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features light-colored walls and a window with sheer curtains that allow soft, natural light to filter in, creating a gentle glow. The window is framed by a yellow border, adding a touch of color to the space. A patterned cushion with red and white designs is visible, suggesting a cozy, lived-in environment. The overall scene is calm and well-lit, with a focus on the interior's simple yet welcoming decor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and completeness.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described (an indoor room, window with yellow border, red and white cushion), the factual details within the caption are accurate. However, the description of the atmosphere and mood is subjective and cannot be verified as fact.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete and misses several required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, first-person), which is a mandatory component of the instructions.\n*   **Motion:** It does not describe any motion or changes within the scene. For a video, this is a critical omission. It should describe if the camera is moving, if light is changing, or if elements like the curtains are moving.\n*   **Time of Day:** While it implies daytime with \"natural light,\" it does not explicitly state the time of day as instructed.\n*   **Overlays:** It makes no mention of potential overlays like text or watermarks.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n*   **Use of Subjective/Emotional Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words and phrases like \"warm, inviting atmosphere,\" \"gentle glow,\" \"cozy,\" and \"welcoming decor.\"\n*   **Inference and Speculation:** The instruction says, \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The caption violates this with phrases like \"suggesting a cozy, lived-in environment.\" This is an interpretation of the scene's meaning, not a direct description of what is visible.\n*   **Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption directly violates this with the concluding phrase, \"with a focus on the interior's simple yet welcoming decor.\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption identifies some visual elements, it fails by injecting subjective interpretation, omitting required information like POV and motion, and ignoring direct prohibitions against inferential and emotional language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a static shot of an indoor room with light-colored walls and a window featuring a yellow border. Sheer curtains allow natural light to filter in, indicating daytime. A patterned cushion with red and white designs is visible.
