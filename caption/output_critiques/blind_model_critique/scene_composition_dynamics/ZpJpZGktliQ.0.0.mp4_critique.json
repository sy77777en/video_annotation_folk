    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in an opulent indoor room from a historical period, characterized by dark, patterned wallpaper and extensive wood paneling with carved arches. A large fireplace with a dark green surround is topped by an elaborate wooden mantelpiece, which holds decorative items including a white taxidermy bird and a blue and white vase. In the room, a long, dark wood table is accompanied by matching chairs with carved backs. A man in a vest sits at the table, and a woman in a period dress stands behind him. An overlay of white text is visible in the lower-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good and closely follows the instructions. It is accurate, informative, and adheres to most of the specified formatting and content rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective, along with minor suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Scene Elements:** The caption correctly identifies all major visual elements: the \"dark, patterned wallpaper,\" \"wood paneling with carved arches,\" the \"fireplace with a dark green surround,\" the \"wooden mantelpiece,\" the \"white taxidermy bird,\" the \"blue and white vase,\" the \"dark wood table,\" and the \"chairs with carved backs.\"\n*   **Subjects:** The placement and description of the \"man in a vest\" and \"woman in a period dress\" are accurate and concise, fitting the instruction to complement the scene without excessive detail.\n*   **Overlay:** It correctly identifies the \"overlay of white text\" and its position in the \"lower-left corner.\"\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Setting and Environment:** The caption successfully establishes the setting as an \"indoor room from a historical period,\" which is a correct and non-speculative description.\n*   **Notable Details:** It includes specific details about color (\"dark green surround,\" \"blue and white vase\"), material (\"wood paneling,\" \"wooden mantelpiece\"), and shape (\"carved arches,\" \"carved backs\"), as requested.\n*   **Adherence to Negative Constraints:** The caption correctly avoids forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), speculation (\"it appears\"), emotional language, and inferences about the scene's purpose.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that flows well.\n*   **Focus:** The primary focus is on the setting and scenery, with the subjects mentioned only in context.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without markdown or introductory text.\n\n### Minor Areas for Improvement\n*   **Point of View:** The instruction asks to indicate the point of view if relevant. The caption omits this. The video is filmed from a **static, eye-level point of view**, which could have been mentioned at the beginning to better frame the scene for the viewer.\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The words \"opulent\" and \"elaborate\" lean slightly subjective, which the instructions advise against. While they are descriptively fitting, more neutral alternatives like \"ornate\" or \"highly-decorated\" could be used to adhere more strictly to the rule. However, this is a very minor deviation.\n*   **Specificity:** The \"white taxidermy bird\" is under a glass dome, a notable feature that could have been included for slightly better completeness (e.g., \"a white taxidermy bird under a glass dome\").\n\nOverall, the caption is a high-quality execution of the instructions, providing a clear and objective description of the video. The suggested improvements are minor refinements to an already strong caption.",
