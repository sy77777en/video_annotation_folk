    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features a long dining table with white tablecloths, surrounded by red-cushioned chairs. The ceiling is adorned with intricate patterns and a central hanging light fixture, casting a soft glow over the scene. The time of day is likely evening, suggested by the subdued lighting. Notable visual elements include plates of food, primarily noodles, and glasses filled with iced beverages, adding a touch of color to the otherwise muted palette. The environment is intimate, with a focus on the dining experience, as seen through the presence of chopsticks and neatly arranged tableware. The overall ambiance is calm and reflective, with a sense of quiet conversation and shared meals.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be factually accurate in its description of the physical objects within the scene (a restaurant, table, chairs, food, lighting). It correctly identifies elements like \"red-cushioned chairs,\" \"white tablecloths,\" and \"plates of food, primarily noodles.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete. It omits several required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** It fails to mention the POV (e.g., first-person, static shot, panning shot), which is a mandatory component of the instructions.\n*   **Motion or Changes:** It describes a static scene and does not mention if there is any movement, such as steam rising from the food, people eating, or camera movement. If the video is static, this should be implied by describing the POV as a \"static shot.\"\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption severely violates the core negative constraints of the instructions, making it a poor fit.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption is filled with subjective language.\n    *   **Examples:** \"warm, inviting atmosphere,\" \"intimate\" environment, \"calm and reflective\" ambiance. These words describe feelings and interpretations, not objective visual facts.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses speculative phrasing.\n    *   **Example:** \"**likely** evening, **suggested by** the subdued lighting.\" The instructions explicitly forbid phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be,\" and this falls into the same category of uncertainty. It should state the time of day based on visual evidence (e.g., \"The scene is set during the evening under artificial light\").\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The caption repeatedly interprets the purpose and focus of the scene.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...**adding a touch of color** to the otherwise muted palette,\" \"...with a **focus on the dining experience**,\" \"...a **sense of quiet conversation and shared meals**.\" These statements explain the *effect* of the visual elements and infer activities or feelings that are not explicitly visible, which is forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\":**\n    *   **Example:** \"a sense of quiet conversation.\" Conversation is an auditory or behavioral element that cannot be confirmed from a visual-only description unless people are visibly talking.\n\n### Revised Example Caption (Following Instructions)\n\nTo illustrate the difference, here is a caption that correctly follows the provided instructions, using the same visual details:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the scene is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant at night. A long dining table with a white tablecloth is surrounded by chairs with red cushions. On the table are plates of noodles, glasses containing ice and a dark beverage, and chopsticks. The ceiling features decorative patterns and a central hanging light fixture that casts artificial light onto the scene.",
