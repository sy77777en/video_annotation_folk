    "pre_caption": "A third-person 3D game video shows a character running down a street in a stylized urban environment under a vibrant purple sky with white clouds. The street is flanked by dark, blocky buildings with numerous windows, some of which appear weathered. In the distance, lighter-colored buildings and a green guard tower are visible. A purple A-frame sign stands on the sidewalk. The scene is presented with several overlay elements, including a dark metallic frame. A heads-up display shows \"Island XP: 206\" and \"So-Tep Items: Dirty Clothes\" in the top left, a green bar with the word \"Reactionary\" at the top center, and a text box in the top right that reads, \"Try out your new vape juice.\" At the bottom, a bar displays \"Current pill: Viagra,\" which later changes to \"Current pill: THC Extract,\" and a circular minimap is located in the bottom right corner. A circular icon in the bottom left initially contains a blue geometric shape and then changes to a drop icon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good for the video. It effectively follows the instructions by providing a detailed and objective description.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is successful:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It precisely identifies the content of the overlay text (e.g., \"Island XP: 206,\" \"Current pill: Viagra\"), the colors of objects (purple sky, green guard tower), and the specific shapes (A-frame sign, circular minimap). It also accurately notes the changes that occur within the overlay elements during the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully covers all the required aspects from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identifies the \"third-person 3D game video\" perspective.\n*   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly describes the \"stylized urban environment\" with its \"dark, blocky buildings,\" street, and sidewalk.\n*   **Time of Day/Atmosphere:** Mentions the \"vibrant purple sky with white clouds,\" which establishes the scene's lighting and mood.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Details specific features like the \"green guard tower\" and the \"purple A-frame sign.\"\n*   **Overlays:** Provides an exhaustive and well-organized description of all HUD elements, including the frame, text boxes, bars, minimap, and icons, noting their specific content and placement.\n*   **Motion and Changes:** It correctly describes the character's motion (\"running down a street\") and the dynamic changes in the overlay text and icons (\"later changes to 'Current pill: THC Extract'\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres strictly to the provided guidelines:\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   It avoids subjective or emotional language, using descriptive terms like \"blocky\" and \"dark\" instead.\n*   It does not speculate on unseen details or infer the purpose of the setting (e.g., it doesn't guess what the game is about).\n*   It correctly identifies overlays as separate from the scene and describes them as instructed.\n*   It combines details from the entire video into one description, noting changes over time without referencing specific frames.\n\nThe only minor point for improvement is the phrase \"some of which appear weathered.\" The instruction asks to avoid speculative words like \"appears.\" A more objective alternative would be \"some of which have textured surfaces suggesting wear.\" However, this is a very minor issue in an otherwise excellent caption.",
