    "pre_caption": "The video takes place inside a classroom during the daytime, with sunlight streaming through a window on the left, casting natural light onto the scene. The classroom features blue walls, a large green chalkboard, and a wooden desk with a smooth surface and rounded edges. Stacks of books with colorful covers and visible spines are arranged on a nearby table, and a few papers are scattered on the desk. The window reveals a glimpse of green foliage outside, indicating a clear day. The overall environment is tidy and organized, with simple furnishings and a calm atmosphere. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully follows many of the core instructions but fails on a few key points.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption is accurate in its description of the classroom's physical elements (blue walls, green chalkboard, wooden desk, books, papers, and foliage).\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Information:** The caption fails to describe the **point of view**. The instructions explicitly ask to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" The caption should have specified if this was a static shot, a slow pan, a handheld view, etc.\n*   **Missing Information:** The caption does not mention any **motion or changes**. If the video is completely static, this is correct. However, if there is any movement (such as leaves rustling outside the window, dust motes floating in the sunlight, or a slow camera pan), it has been omitted.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n    *   It successfully combines details into a coherent scene without referring to specific frames.\n    *   It accurately identifies the setting (indoors, classroom), time of day (daytime), and notable visual elements with details on color, material, and shape (e.g., \"wooden desk with a smooth surface and rounded edges\").\n    *   It correctly states that \"No overlays... are present,\" directly addressing that instruction.\n    *   It avoids speculation, inference about the scene's purpose, and terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation:** The caption uses the phrase \"a calm atmosphere.\" This is a subjective and emotional description, which directly violates the instruction: \"**Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.**\"\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"The overall environment is tidy and organized\" is also subjective, though less emotional than \"calm.\" A more neutral description would focus on the placement of objects, which the caption already does (e.g., \"stacks of books... are arranged,\" \"a few papers are scattered\").\n    *   **Omission:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" it omits the required description of the point of view.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written and captures the visual details of the scene effectively. However, to be considered \"good\" according to the strict rules provided, it must be revised to remove the subjective phrase \"calm atmosphere\" and include a description of the camera's point of view.",
