    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a breakdown of its performance against the requirements:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It correctly identifies the key elements: the first-person perspective, the night-vision aesthetic, the weapon with a specific sight, the opening in the floor, the room below, and the HUD overlay. The details provided, such as the \"monochromatic green hue\" and the \"red dot sight,\" are precise and factual.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and covers all the necessary components outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"first-person POV\" and explains its effect (\"as if through the character’s eyes\").\n*   **Environment & Setting:** It clearly describes the immediate environment (\"a rectangular opening in a floor\") and the setting below (\"a dark room or corridor with a visible doorway\").\n*   **Time of Day:** It effectively implies nighttime by describing the scene as \"consistent with night vision.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It successfully distinguishes between in-scene elements (the rifle) and \"heads-up display overlay,\" describing their appearance and placement as instructed.\n*   **Subject Placement:** The subject is implicitly the viewer/character, and their presence is perfectly contextualized through the POV and the \"rifle... held in the foreground.\"\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the negative and positive constraints of the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** The description is a single, well-structured paragraph that flows logically from the overall perspective to specific details.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words (\"scary,\" \"tense\") and speculative phrases (\"it might be,\" \"it seems\").\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It prioritizes describing the setting and key objects over any narrative or character actions.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **No Inference:** It does not infer the purpose of the scene (e.g., a military operation, a video game) or explain what the scene is meant to emphasize.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and comprehensive without being verbose or speculative. It successfully translates the visual information into a clear and concise text description that meets every single requirement.",
