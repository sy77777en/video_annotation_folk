    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors, likely in a dimly lit room with a night vision effect, giving everything a green tint. The setting includes electronic equipment, such as speakers and a monitor, suggesting a studio or control room environment. The walls are dark, and the lighting is minimal, creating a shadowy atmosphere. A person is present, moving within the space, interacting with the equipment. The overall scene is characterized by its low-light conditions and the presence of technology, with the person adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it captures the general essence of the scene, it fails to adhere to several critical negative and positive constraints outlined in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is inadequate:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The description of a dimly lit, green-tinted room with electronic equipment and a person is likely accurate to the visual content of the video. However, its accuracy is undermined by speculative language.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the point of view (e.g., first-person, static camera, handheld). The caption completely omits this crucial detail.\n*   **Lacks Object Detail:** The instructions ask for descriptions of color, material, shape, and distinguishing features of notable elements. The caption mentions \"speakers and a monitor\" but provides no further description, failing to meet this requirement.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several key rules:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculative Statements\":** The caption uses the phrases \"**likely** in a dimly lit room\" and \"**suggesting** a studio or control room environment.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative language such as \"likely,\" \"suggesting,\" \"might be,\" or \"it appears.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The phrase \"**suggesting a studio or control room environment**\" directly infers the purpose and role of the setting, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The phrase \"**shadowy atmosphere**\" is subjective and interpretive rather than a neutral, factual description of the lighting.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final sentence, \"The overall scene is **characterized by** its low-light conditions and the presence of technology, with the person **adding a dynamic element** to the otherwise static environment,\" is purely analytical. It explains the scene's characteristics and the role of the person, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid introductory text\":** The caption begins with \"The video takes place indoors...\" This is unnecessary introductory phrasing. The description should begin directly with the scene's details.\n\n### Corrected Example Following Instructions\n\nTo illustrate the difference, here is a version of the caption that adheres to the instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the scene is an indoor room viewed through a night vision filter that casts a green hue over the entire space. The room is dimly lit with dark walls. In the setting is electronic equipment, including a rectangular monitor and two boxy speakers. A person is present, moving within the room and interacting with the equipment.",
