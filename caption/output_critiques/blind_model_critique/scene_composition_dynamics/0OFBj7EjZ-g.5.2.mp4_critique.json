    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor urban setting featuring a tall cylindrical building with a green glass facade. The structure is surrounded by other modern buildings with white exteriors and numerous windows, suggesting a cityscape. The time of day appears to be overcast, as the lighting is diffused and soft, with no direct sunlight visible. A large green tarp partially covers the cylindrical building, indicating construction or renovation work. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective. Overlay elements include text in the bottom left corner, displaying technical details such as resolution and frame rate, which are not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good, but it has several specific violations of the instructions that prevent it from being excellent. It successfully captures the main visual elements but fails to adhere to some of the key negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate in its description of the physical scene. It correctly identifies the key elements: an outdoor urban setting, a cylindrical building with a green glass facade, a green tarp, surrounding modern buildings, and overcast lighting. The description of the overlay text is also precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It includes the setting, environment, time of day, notable visual elements, and overlays. However, it does not mention any **motion**. If the video is a static shot with no movement (e.g., no moving clouds, flags, or distant traffic), then this is acceptable. If there is any movement, its omission makes the caption incomplete.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise Description:** It provides a clear and concise summary of the scene.\n*   **Describes Visual Elements:** It details the color, shape, and material of the buildings as instructed (e.g., \"cylindrical building with a green glass facade,\" \"modern buildings with white exteriors\").\n*   **Identifies Overlays:** It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay element,\" describes its content (\"technical details such as resolution and frame rate\"), and notes its placement (\"bottom left corner\"), perfectly following the instruction.\n*   **Avoids \"Image\" or \"Frame\":** The caption successfully avoids using forbidden terms.\n*   **Single Paragraph:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to the instructions:**\n\n1.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly states to avoid speculative statements like \"it appears.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption says, \"The time of day **appears to be** overcast...\"\n    *   **Correction:** It should state the observation directly: \"The time of day is overcast, with diffused and soft lighting...\"\n\n2.  **Inference and Interpretation:** The instruction states, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n    *   **Violation 1:** The caption says the surrounding buildings are \"**suggesting a cityscape**.\" This is an inference.\n    *   **Correction:** It should describe the visual fact: \"...surrounded by other modern buildings, forming a cityscape.\"\n    *   **Violation 2:** The caption says the green tarp is \"**indicating construction or renovation work**.\" This is a strong inference about the purpose of the tarp, which is not directly visible.\n    *   **Correction:** It should only describe what is seen: \"A large green tarp partially covers the cylindrical building.\"\n\n3.  **Vague Point of View and Explaining Effect:** The instruction asks to specify the POV (e.g., drone, dashcam) and to \"not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption uses the vague term \"**objective point of view**\" and then explains its effect: \"**providing a detached, observational perspective**.\" This violates the rule against explaining emphasis.\n    *   **Correction:** A better description would be more direct, such as \"The scene is captured from a static, low-angle point of view.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a good attempt that correctly identifies most visual details. However, its quality is significantly reduced by the inclusion of speculative language, inferences about the scene's context, and an explanation of the shot's perceived effect, all of which are explicitly forbidden by the detailed instructions.",
