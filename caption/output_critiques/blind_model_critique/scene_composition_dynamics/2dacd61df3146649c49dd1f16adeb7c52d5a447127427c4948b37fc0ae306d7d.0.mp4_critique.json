    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a long, narrow corridor in an abandoned building, characterized by its deteriorating condition and graffiti-covered walls. The setting is indoors, with large windows on one side allowing natural light to filter in, casting a muted glow over the scene. The walls are adorned with colorful graffiti, featuring various shapes and markings, adding a chaotic yet vibrant element to the otherwise decaying environment. The floor is cracked and littered with debris, leading to a pile of rubble at the far end of the corridor. The ceiling shows signs of wear, with peeling paint and exposed materials. The overall atmosphere is one of neglect and abandonment, with the corridor stretching into the distance, emphasizing the building's desolate state.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general setting of the abandoned corridor, but it misses key dynamic and specific visual elements from the video. It fails to mention the first-person point of view, where the camera moves slowly and steadily down the length of the corridor, creating an immersive walkthrough experience. The description of light is too general; it should specify that distinct, bright shafts of late-afternoon sunlight pierce through the grimy, broken window panes, illuminating swirling dust motes in the air. The caption also omits specific details about the debris, which includes not just a pile of rubble but also scattered broken bricks, pieces of drywall, and a rusted fire extinguisher lying on its side. While it mentions \"colorful graffiti,\" it neglects to describe the most prominent piece: a large, detailed mural of a face covering a significant portion of the left wall. Furthermore, the caption uses subjective and emotional language such as \"chaotic yet vibrant\" and \"desolate state,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions. Finally, it completely misses the small, semi-transparent creator watermark, \"@UrbanExplorers,\" present in the bottom-right corner throughout the video.",
