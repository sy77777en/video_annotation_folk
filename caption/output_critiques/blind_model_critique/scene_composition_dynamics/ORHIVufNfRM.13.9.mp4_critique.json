    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a descent into a dark, alien ocean. The view, framed by the reddish-orange border of a visor, glides over a sandy, greenish-brown seafloor dotted with dark rock formations and patches of underwater flora. Large schools of small, bioluminescent organisms illuminate the dark water, some appearing as bright cyan points of light and others as glowing, leaf-shaped creatures. The perspective moves down a steep underwater cliff into a much deeper and darker abyss, with the character's gloved hands occasionally visible at the bottom of the frame. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Loopy Longplays\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully meets all the requirements with a high degree of precision and clarity.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It correctly identifies the first-person point of view, the underwater alien setting, and the key visual elements. Details like the \"reddish-orange border of a visor,\" the \"sandy, greenish-brown seafloor,\" and the specific types of \"bioluminescent organisms\" (cyan points, leaf-shaped creatures) are precise and reflect what is visible. The description of motion—a \"descent\" that \"glides\" over the seafloor and down a \"steep underwater cliff\"—is also a correct representation of the action.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive and includes all the elements requested in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as a \"first-person POV shot.\"\n*   **Setting:** Identified as a \"dark, alien ocean.\"\n*   **Environment:** Detailed with descriptions of the seafloor, rock formations, flora, and the deep abyss.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The visor, the character's gloved hands, and the bioluminescent creatures are all described with their specific colors and shapes.\n*   **Motion:** The continuous \"descent\" and gliding movement are effectively described.\n*   **Overlays:** The text overlay is correctly identified as such, with its content (\"Loopy Longplays\") and placement (\"bottom left corner\") specified.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption perfectly adheres to the stylistic and structural rules:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Conciseness:** It provides a wealth of information without being overly long or wordy.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"eerie\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It prioritizes the environment and setting, only mentioning the subject (the character's hands) to provide context for the POV, as instructed.\n*   **No Frame-by-Frame Description:** It synthesizes the entire video into one fluid description of movement and scenery.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly uses \"overlay\" to describe the text element and avoids forbidden words like \"image.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary execution of the instructions. It is descriptive, accurate, and structured exactly as requested, resulting in a clear and informative summary of the video's content.",
