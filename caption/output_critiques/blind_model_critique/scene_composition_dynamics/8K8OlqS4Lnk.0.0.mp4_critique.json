    "pre_caption": "The video shows an outdoor scene dominated by a bright double rainbow arching across a grey, overcast sky. Below the rainbow, lush green treetops are visible, along with several horizontal power lines stretching across the view. As the video progresses, the view pans slightly, revealing more of the ground level, including a paved road running alongside a white fence. Behind the fence and trees, buildings and a tall palm tree can be seen in the background. The overall lighting suggests daytime, likely following a rain shower.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few key areas for improvement regarding adherence to the specific instructions. It successfully captures the main visual elements but misses some required details and includes speculative language.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the major visual elements: the double rainbow, the overcast sky, the green treetops, power lines, the paved road, the white fence, background buildings, and a palm tree. The description of the camera motion as a slight pan is also accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one key element required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions explicitly ask to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" The caption fails to mention that the scene is captured from an eye-level or first-person perspective, which is implied by the stable panning motion.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most room for improvement.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n*   It avoids using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than subjects.\n*   It correctly describes motion (\"the view pans slightly\").\n*   The language is simple and natural.\n\n**Where it deviates from the instructions:**\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** The caption violates this rule. The phrase \"**likely following a rain shower**\" is a speculative statement about an event that is not visible. The instruction clearly states, \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n*   **Avoids Subjective Adjectives:** The word \"**dominated**\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's composition. While \"bright\" and \"lush\" are descriptive, they can also lean subjective. Sticking to more neutral descriptors would be better.\n*   **Redundant Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video shows,\" which is redundant. The instructions imply the output should be the description itself, without an introductory phrase.\n*   **Inference:** The phrase \"**suggests daytime**\" is a minor inference. A more direct statement like \"The scene is set during the daytime under an overcast sky\" would be more compliant with the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n\n### Revised Caption Example\nHere is an example of a revised caption that more closely follows all instructions:\n\nFrom an eye-level point of view, the outdoor scene is set during the daytime beneath a grey, overcast sky. A double rainbow arches over green treetops and several horizontal power lines. The view pans slightly to reveal a paved road next to a white fence, with buildings and a tall palm tree visible in the background behind the trees.",
