    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors along a wide, multi-lane road bordered by a tall stone wall with a textured, block-like pattern. Several small, boxy vehicles in muted colors such as white, gray, and black travel along the road, spaced apart from each other. On one side of the road, a row of evenly spaced, slender trees with green foliage stands behind a chain-link fence, and in the background, faint outlines of larger buildings are visible. The weather appears clear, with no visible precipitation or wet surfaces. The scene also features a large arched gateway built into the stone wall, and a series of orange traffic cones arranged in a line near the entrance, suggesting a controlled or restricted area. The overall color palette is subdued, with grays and greens dominating the environment. No overlay elements such as text or icons are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few specific errors that violate the instructions. It successfully captures many key details but fails on some negative constraints.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption appears to be accurate. It describes tangible elements like a stone wall, multi-lane road, vehicles, trees, a chain-link fence, an arched gateway, and traffic cones. The descriptions of color (\"muted colors,\" \"orange,\" \"grays and greens\") and texture (\"textured, block-like pattern\") are specific and verifiable.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing two key pieces of information requested in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions ask to specify the POV (e.g., first-person, dashcam, static shot). This is not mentioned.\n*   **Time of Day:** While it describes the weather as clear, it does not explicitly state the time of day (e.g., daytime, morning, afternoon), which is a required element.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows many instructions well but fails on two important negative constraints.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It provides a concise, single-paragraph description of the overall scene.\n*   It avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It describes the setting (outdoors, road), notable visual elements (wall, gateway, cones), and their features (color, material, shape).\n*   It correctly notes the motion in the scene (\"vehicles travel along the road\").\n*   It correctly states the absence of overlay elements.\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to instructions:**\n*   **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The caption violates this by saying, \"The weather **appears** clear.\" It should state the condition directly (e.g., \"The weather is clear\").\n*   **Inference of Scene Role:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The caption violates this rule with the phrase, \"**suggesting a controlled or restricted area**.\" This is an interpretation of why the traffic cones are there, not a direct observation of the scene itself.",
