    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a dimly lit bedroom at night. The primary light source is a small, circular lamp on the wall, which casts a warm, orange glow onto an unmade bed with white sheets and pillows. A red pillow is visible next to the white ones. Above the bed, a long, rectangular framed picture hangs on the beige wall. An open doorway offers a view into a lit hallway, where a toilet and a chair can be seen in the background. Another framed picture is on the wall to the right of the doorway. The rest of the room is enveloped in shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is very good but has one notable omission.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a dimly lit bedroom at night, the first-person POV, and the specific objects within the room (lamp, unmade bed, pillows, framed pictures).\n*   Details like the lamp's circular shape, the orange glow, the red pillow, the rectangular picture, and the contents of the hallway (toilet, chair) are all factually correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully includes the point of view, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements as requested.\n*   **Omission:** The caption fails to describe the motion in the video. The instruction states, \"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe... human-made movements.\" The video features a slow pan from left to right, which reveals the doorway and the hallway. The caption describes the scene as if it were a static image, missing this key dynamic element.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption excels at following the negative constraints. It avoids subjective language, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), and does not infer the scene's purpose. It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the POV and briefly explains its effect (\"as if through the character’s eyes\").\n*   **Structure:** The description is logically structured, moving from the overall setting to specific details within it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy and adherence to the stylistic rules. Its only significant flaw is that it describes a video as if it were a still photograph, completely omitting the slow camera pan that occurs. To be perfect, it should have incorporated a brief description of this movement.",
