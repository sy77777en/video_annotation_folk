    "pre_caption": "The video shows a static indoor scene, presented from an objective point of view. The setting is very dark, focusing on an object within a confined, box-like space. Light enters from the left through horizontal slats, illuminating a central object that appears to be made of a dark, heavily crumpled material with a rough, stone-like texture. The object fills much of the visible space within the enclosure, casting deep shadows. The overall color palette is muted and dominated by dark tones and shadows, contrasted by the brighter light filtering through the slats.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the dark, high-contrast nature of the scene, it could be more specific to better reflect the visual details. The \"objective point of view\" is vague; the video is actually filmed from a fixed, straight-on perspective, making the viewer feel as if they are peering directly into the enclosure. The \"box-like space\" has discernible features that are missed, such as its smooth, non-reflective black interior walls, which starkly contrast with the central object's texture. The description of the object as \"heavily crumpled material\" is a good start, but the video shows it has sharp, angular folds, more like a piece of folded, thick black paper or metal than randomly crumpled fabric. Furthermore, its \"stone-like texture\" has a subtle, low-sheen, almost graphitic quality that isn't mentioned. The light is not just generic; it's a cool, white light, and the beams are well-defined, with visible dust motes slowly drifting within them, adding a subtle element of motion to an otherwise static shot. Finally, the \"horizontal slats\" are very thin and closely spaced, suggesting the enclosure is relatively small, a detail that provides a better sense of scale.",
