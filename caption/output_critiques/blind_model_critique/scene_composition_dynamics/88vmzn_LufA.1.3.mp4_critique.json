A long, black limousine, distinguished by US and Presidential flags on its front fenders and a seal on the rear door, is shown driving along the road.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few areas for improvement to fully meet the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the scene's elements. It correctly identifies the vehicles (black limousine, black SUV), their distinguishing features (US and Presidential flags, seal, red emergency light bar), the setting (paved city street with modern buildings), and the time of day (daylight).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing a key required element:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the POV (e.g., street-level, high-angle, tracking shot). The caption fails to describe how the scene is being viewed, which is a significant omission.\n*   **Transition:** The phrase \"Following this\" indicates a sequence but does not describe the *type* of transition between the shot of the limousine and the shot of the SUV (e.g., a hard cut, a pan, or if the SUV simply enters the same continuous shot). The instructions ask for a description of how scene transitions occur.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Neutral and Objective:** The caption successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives and does not speculate on the purpose of the scene (e.g., it correctly avoids calling it a \"motorcade\").\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear, one-paragraph summary of the key visual information.\n*   **Focus on Detail:** It correctly describes the color, markings, and features of the vehicles as instructed.\n*   **Proper Language:** It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses simple, natural English.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Missing POV:** The most significant failure to adhere to the instructions is the omission of the point of view.\n*   **Vague Transition:** The description of the scene's progression is not as precise as the instructions require regarding transitions.\n*   **Slightly Awkward Phrasing:** The opening \"The video is set on...\" is functional but less integrated than starting directly with the scene's description (e.g., \"From a street-level view...\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is well-written and follows many of the core rules, particularly regarding tone and object description. However, its failure to include the mandatory **point of view** and its lack of specificity regarding the **transition** make it an incomplete execution of the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a street-level view during daylight hours, the video captures a paved city street bordered by modern buildings with large glass windows. A long, black limousine, distinguished by US and Presidential flags on its front fenders and a seal on the rear door, is shown driving along the road. The scene transitions with a smooth pan to reveal a black SUV, equipped with a red emergency light bar on its roof, traveling down the same street. Both vehicles are depicted in motion within this urban environment.",
