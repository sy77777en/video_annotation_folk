    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a grassy savanna, surrounded by lush green trees. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as indicated by the clear visibility and natural light. A group of buffalo is prominently featured, standing amidst tall, dry grass that sways gently, suggesting a light breeze. The buffalo are dark in color, contrasting with the pale grass and vibrant greenery of the trees. The scene is calm and natural, with no visible human presence or structures, emphasizing the untouched wilderness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption is generally accurate in its description of the core visual elements: an outdoor savanna, trees, and a group of buffalo in dry grass.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption does not mention the point of view (e.g., static eye-level shot), which is a required element if relevant.\n*   **Incomplete Motion Description:** While it mentions the grass sways, it uses the speculative term \"suggesting a light breeze\" instead of simply stating the observed motion.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates numerous negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" is violated with the use of \"**serene**,\" \"**lush**,\" \"**vibrant**,\" and \"**calm**.\"\n*   **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instruction \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'\" is violated by using \"**likely**\" (\"The time of day is likely morning or afternoon\") and \"**suggesting**\" (\"suggesting a light breeze\").\n*   **Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:** The instruction \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\" is violated twice.\n    *   \"...a group of buffalo is **prominently featured**...\"\n    *   \"...**emphasizing the untouched wilderness**.\"\n*   **Inferring Information:** The caption infers the reason for the time of day (\"**as indicated by the clear visibility**\"), which goes against the instruction to describe only what is visible and avoid explanation.\n*   **Describing Visual Relationships:** The phrase \"**contrasting with** the pale grass\" is an analytical comment about the visual composition, which leans away from the instruction to provide a simple, direct description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an outdoor savanna with green trees and a group of dark-colored buffalo standing in tall, dry grass. The grass moves gently, indicating a breeze. The scene is captured in natural light, with no human presence or structures visible. The shot is at eye level, providing a clear view of the buffalo and surrounding landscape.",
