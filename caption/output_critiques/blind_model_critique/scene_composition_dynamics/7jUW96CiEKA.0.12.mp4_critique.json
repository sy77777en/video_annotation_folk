    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a grassy savanna, surrounded by lush green trees. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as indicated by the clear visibility and natural light. A group of buffalo is prominently featured, standing amidst tall, dry grass that sways gently, suggesting a light breeze. The buffalo are dark in color, contrasting with the pale grass and vibrant greenery of the trees. The scene is calm and natural, with no visible human presence or structures, emphasizing the untouched wilderness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subjects and general environment, but it lacks specificity and includes prohibited subjective and speculative language. For instance, the time of day is definitively late afternoon, evidenced by the long, distinct shadows cast by the buffalo and the warm, golden hue of the sunlight, rather than a speculative \"morning or afternoon.\" The description of the \"lush green trees\" could be more precise, as the video shows scattered, flat-topped acacia trees characteristic of the savanna. The caption also omits the point of view, which is a stable, eye-level shot that slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the herd and a distant, hazy mountain range on the horizon. While it mentions swaying grass, it misses other subtle motions like the dust kicked up by the buffalo's hooves and the shimmering heat haze in the distance. Furthermore, it fails to note the semi-transparent channel logo watermark overlaid in the bottom-right corner. Replacing subjective terms like \"serene\" and \"untouched\" with these concrete visual details would create a more accurate and informative description.",
