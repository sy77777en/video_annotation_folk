    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video described. It meticulously follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes the scene's key elements: the dark bedroom setting, the time of day (\"at night\"), the single light source (lamp), and the specific objects present. The descriptions of the objects are factual and detailed, noting the lamp's \"bronze-colored base\" and \"white, trapezoidal shade,\" the \"light green sheet,\" and the \"patterned blanket.\" The action of the person getting into bed is also described accurately.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers the environment, lighting, notable props, and the central motion within the scene. It successfully paints a full picture by describing the initial state and the changes that occur. The only minor detail that could have been included is the point of view (e.g., \"From a static, eye-level point of view...\"), but its omission does not detract from the overall quality, as the scene's nature is clear without it.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates an outstanding adherence to the specific rules provided:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the entire scene in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** The primary focus is on the bedroom, the furniture, and the lighting, with the person described as an element within that setting, not the main subject.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words (\"cozy,\" \"peaceful\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\"). The description of the \"small, black, cylindrical object\" is a perfect example of describing only what is visible without inferring its function.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Describes Motion:** It clearly explains the movement of the person getting into bed and pulling up the blanket.\n*   **Describes Visual Elements:** It provides specific details on color, shape, and pattern for notable objects as instructed.\n*   **Simple and Natural English:** The language is clear, direct, and easy to understand.",
