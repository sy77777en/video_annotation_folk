    "pre_caption": "The video presents an outdoor setting viewed from an objective perspective, focusing on a circular pit in the ground. The environment is earthy, with the ground appearing dark brown and textured, suggesting soil or dirt. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light cues. The scene features a notable visual element: a person in a white shirt positioned at the edge of the pit, emphasizing the contrast between the dark interior and the lighter clothing. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional architectural or natural features visible. Overlay elements include small text in the bottom left corner, which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it attempts to follow the guidelines, it fails on several key points, particularly regarding objectivity and adherence to negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual content it describes (a person by a pit). Without seeing the video, its factual accuracy cannot be fully verified, but the elements described are plausible and internally consistent.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Information:** The most significant omission is the lack of any description of **motion**. The instructions require describing motion if present (e.g., \"wind blowing through trees,\" \"pedestrians walking\"). The caption describes a static scene. If the person moves, the camera shifts, or there is any environmental movement, the caption is incomplete for failing to mention it.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most significant failures.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\"**: The phrase \"...**emphasizing the contrast** between the dark interior and the lighter clothing\" is a direct violation of this rule. It interprets the visual composition rather than simply describing it.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\"**: The word \"**minimalistic**\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's style. The instruction is to describe what is present, not to apply an artistic label.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\"**: The phrase \"**suggesting soil or dirt**\" is a form of speculation. The instruction is to describe what is visible (\"dark brown and textured ground\") without inferring its material composition unless it is certain.\n*   **Vague Point of View**: The term \"**objective perspective**\" is too general and cinematic. The instructions ask for more descriptive POVs like \"first-person,\" \"drone shot,\" or \"dashcam.\" A better description would be \"a high-angle shot\" or \"an eye-level static shot,\" which describes the camera's physical placement.\n*   **Minor Redundancy**: Stating that the overlay text \"...is not part of the scene itself\" is redundant. The instruction to identify elements as \"overlays\" already accomplishes this distinction, making the additional clause unnecessary.\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres strictly to all the provided instructions, assuming the scene is static:\n\nFrom a high-angle static perspective, the video shows an outdoor scene centered on a circular pit in the ground. The ground is dark brown and has a rough texture. The time of day is not discernible from the available light. A person in a white shirt is positioned at the edge of the pit. An overlay of small text is visible in the bottom left corner.",
