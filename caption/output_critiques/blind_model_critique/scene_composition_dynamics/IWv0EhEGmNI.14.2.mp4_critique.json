    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors within a dimly lit, ornate building. The environment features patterned rugs, decorative wallpaper, and a large, gold-framed portrait of a uniformed figure on the wall. The hallway leads into a room with checkered tile flooring and visible furniture, including a sofa and shelving. Light from an adjacent, more brightly lit room spills into the darker corridor, revealing wooden trim and glass-paneled doors. The scene includes overlay elements: a heads-up display (HUD) with a compass and ammunition count at the bottom right, and a mission objective text overlay at the top center reading “Escape through the north-side tunnel.” These overlays are not part of the physical environment but are superimposed on the video for informational purposes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good and closely follows the instructions, but it has minor areas for improvement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, informative, and adheres to the vast majority of the complex rules provided. It successfully creates a clear mental image of the scene by focusing on objective details.\n\n### Strengths (Adherence to Instructions)\n\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"first-person POV\" and explains its effect (\"as if through the character’s eyes\").\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It clearly states the setting is \"indoors\" and uses descriptive, objective language (\"dimly lit, ornate building,\" \"patterned rugs,\" \"checkered tile flooring\") to build the scene.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It effectively describes key elements like the \"large, gold-framed portrait\" and \"glass-paneled doors\" without excessive detail.\n*   **Overlays:** This is a major strength. The caption correctly identifies the HUD and text as \"overlay elements,\" describes their content and placement, and explicitly states they are \"not part of the physical environment,\" which perfectly aligns with the instructions.\n*   **Tone and Language:** The caption avoids emotional/subjective adjectives, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and inferences about the scene's purpose. The language is simple and natural.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the general setting to specific details and finally to the overlays.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1.  **Inclusion of Meta-Commentary:** The instructions state to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n    *   The phrase **\"The video presents...\"** is introductory and acts as meta-commentary. The description should begin directly.\n    *   The final sentence, **\"These overlays are not part of the physical environment but are superimposed on the video for informational purposes,\"** is an explanation of *why* the overlays are there. While the information is correct, the instruction to simply \"specify that they are overlays\" is sufficient. The explanation is redundant and feels like commentary *about* the video rather than a direct description *of* it.\n\n2.  **Completeness (Minor Omissions):**\n    *   **Motion:** A first-person POV shot, especially with a mission objective, almost certainly involves movement (e.g., walking down the hallway). The caption describes a static scene. The instructions require describing motion if present, so adding a detail like \"the view moves forward through the hallway\" would likely make it more complete.\n    *   **Time of Day:** While \"dimly lit\" is mentioned, the instruction asks to specify the time of day. If it's not discernible, it's fine to omit, but if it's clearly nighttime or a windowless interior, stating that would be more precise.\n\n### Revised Example for Perfection\n\nTo illustrate the suggested improvements, here is a revised version that eliminates the meta-commentary and incorporates a sense of motion:\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, the scene moves through a dimly lit, ornate indoor building. The hallway features patterned rugs, decorative wallpaper, and a large, gold-framed portrait of a uniformed figure. Ahead, a room with checkered tile flooring contains a sofa and shelving, illuminated by light spilling from an adjacent, brighter area that reveals wooden trim and glass-paneled doors. Overlay elements include a heads-up display (HUD) with a compass and ammunition count at the bottom right, and a mission objective text at the top center that reads “Escape through the north-side tunnel.”",
