    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core elements of the scene—a dirt path, surrounding foliage, and a subject—it lacks the specificity and perspective needed to fully capture the video's atmosphere. The point of view is a critical missing detail; describing it as a first-person, handheld shot would explain the slight, natural camera movements and the intimate proximity to the scene. The term \"daytime\" is too general; specifying \"late afternoon\" or \"golden hour\" would better justify the \"muted, warm color palette\" and the soft, filtered sunlight. The description of the environment is also generic; details such as the reddish-brown color of the dirt path, the presence of exposed tree roots, and the specific type of \"dense green foliage,\" like large-leafed tropical plants or ferns, would create a much stronger sense of place. Furthermore, the focus on the woman's specific action of \"putting on a light-colored t-shirt\" gives undue prominence to the subject, whereas the instructions emphasize the setting. A more effective approach would be to simply note her presence on the path, allowing her to be a part of the scenery rather than the central focus of the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds along a reddish-brown dirt path in the late afternoon, surrounded by large-leafed tropical plants and ferns. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting a soft, golden glow over the landscape. The handheld, first-person perspective adds a sense of intimacy and natural movement to the video. A woman in a white bikini top is present on the path, casually blending into the serene environment as she dons a light-colored t-shirt. The overall muted, warm color palette enhances the tranquil, slightly faded atmosphere of the setting.",
