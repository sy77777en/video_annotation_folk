    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor urban setting at dusk, featuring a skatepark with smooth concrete surfaces and palm trees silhouetted against a colorful sky. In the background, a city skyline with illuminated buildings is visible, adding a vibrant urban contrast. The scene includes animated, colorful graffiti elements that appear to interact with the environment, such as bright, abstract shapes and figures. A prominent billboard displays the phrase \"The World is Your Canvas\" in vivid, multicolored lettering, enhancing the artistic and dynamic atmosphere. The overall scene combines natural and urban elements with creative, animated visuals, creating a lively and imaginative environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially effective** but contains significant violations of the instructions. While it accurately identifies several key visual elements, it fails in its adherence to the rules regarding objectivity, completeness, and speculative language.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the outdoor urban setting, the time of day (dusk), the skatepark environment (smooth concrete), the palm trees, the colorful sky, the city skyline with illuminated buildings, and the text on the billboard (\"The World is Your Canvas\").\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Incomplete - Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view. The video uses a dynamic, third-person camera that follows the action, which is a notable element that influences the viewer's perception.\n*   **Incomplete - Subject:** The caption omits the presence of the central subject—the person skateboarding. The instructions state, \"If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail.\" Mentioning the skater is crucial for context, as the animated elements are shown interacting directly with their movements.\n*   **Incomplete - Motion:** While \"animated\" is used, the caption does not adequately describe the primary motion of the scene, which is a person actively skateboarding through the environment.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation - Subjective/Emotional Language:** The caption uses multiple subjective and interpretive phrases, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   `\"vibrant urban contrast\"`: \"Vibrant\" is a subjective adjective.\n    *   `\"enhancing the artistic and dynamic atmosphere\"`: This explains the *effect* and *mood* of the scene, which is a direct violation of the rule: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   `\"creative, animated visuals, creating a lively and imaginative environment\"`: This entire concluding sentence is interpretive. \"Creative,\" \"lively,\" and \"imaginative\" are all subjective, emotional adjectives that describe the feel of the scene rather than its objective contents.\n\n*   **Violation - Speculative Language:** The caption uses the phrase `\"appear to interact\"`, which violates the rule to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" The animated elements are clearly designed to interact with the environment and the skater; it is not an ambiguous appearance.\n\n*   **Violation - Explaining the Scene's Role:** The phrase `\"adding a vibrant urban contrast\"` infers the role of the skyline, which is against the instruction: \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption starts with a strong, objective description but quickly devolves into subjective interpretation. It correctly identifies the setting and key objects but fails by adding emotional descriptors, explaining the scene's atmosphere, and omitting crucial contextual information like the point of view and the presence of the skater. To meet the instructions, the caption must be rewritten to be strictly descriptive, removing all interpretive language and including the missing objective details.",
