    "pre_caption": "The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of a vast desert landscape with rolling sand dunes under a clear blue sky. In the center, a large, weathered submarine is partially buried in the sand, surrounded by a cluster of makeshift structures and equipment. These structures are composed of various materials, including metal and wood, and are scattered around the submarine, suggesting a settlement or outpost. The scene is devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the arid environment. In the background, a range of rocky mountains adds depth to the setting. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and desolation, with the sun casting sharp shadows across the sand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the drone point of view and the primary elements of the desert scene, but it violates several key instructions by including subjective and inferential language such as \"isolation and desolation\" and \"suggesting a settlement or outpost.\" The description is also static, failing to mention the drone's slow, circular pan around the central submarine, a key motion that reveals different angles of the scene. It misses specific visual details that would enhance the description, such as the submarine's dark grey, rust-streaked hull or the composition of the makeshift structures, which include corrugated tin shacks, canvas tarps stretched over metal frames, and a few glinting solar panels. Furthermore, the caption omits the subtle but constant motion of fine sand blowing across the surface of the dunes in the wind. While it mentions \"sharp shadows,\" it could more precisely establish the late-afternoon time of day by describing them as long shadows stretching eastward from the submarine and surrounding structures. Finally, the caption fails to note the minimalist overlay in the bottom-right corner, which displays altitude and coordinates in a simple white font.",
