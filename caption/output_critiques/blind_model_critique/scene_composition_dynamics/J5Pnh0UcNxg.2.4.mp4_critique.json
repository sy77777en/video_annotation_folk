    "pre_caption": "The video, from an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character showing their upper body and the scene ahead, depicts a dimly lit indoor residential hallway, likely at night. The character holds a dark, rectangular smartphone, its screen casting a cool, faint light forward, illuminating the narrow passage with light-colored walls. Directly ahead, at the end of the hallway, a closed white door with a small vent near its top is visible. To the right of the character, another closed door with a round doorknob can be seen. Further along the right wall, a light-colored, wall-mounted rectangular panel, possibly an electrical box, is present. Adjacent to this panel, a white piece of furniture supports a woven basket, and some green foliage is visible above the panel. The overall scene is dark, with the phone serving as the primary light source.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The description of the point of view as \"over-the-shoulder...showing their chest-above body\" is slightly inaccurate for the video I watched; it is more of a first-person perspective where the character's own arm and the phone they are holding are visible in the lower portion of the view, rather than seeing the back of their head or shoulders. The caption also misses the crucial element of motion; the character is walking slowly, which causes the phone's light to sway, creating dynamic, moving shadows that stretch along the hallway walls and add a significant visual effect. The description of the \"screen\" in the upper right is too vague; in the video, it is clearly a dark, glossy television screen mounted on the wall, and it reflects a distorted, moving image of the phone's light as the character advances. Furthermore, the caption uses speculative language like \"likely at night\" and \"possibly an electrical box,\" whereas the video confirms it is nighttime through a small window in one of the open doorways showing complete darkness outside, and the panel is identifiable as a metal fuse box due to a visible latch and hinge. Finally, the description of the walls as just \"light-colored\" is an understatement; the phone's harsh light reveals a textured, off-white paint finish with visible scuff marks near the floor, and the \"white piece of furniture\" is a low, wooden console table.",
