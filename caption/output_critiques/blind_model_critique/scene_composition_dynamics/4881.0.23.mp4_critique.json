    "pre_caption": "The scene is set within a dimly lit room with dark blue walls, where a group of people are gathered. The walls are decorated with framed pictures containing floral patterns, and a black shelf in the background holds several white candles. The subjects are positioned around a glass coffee table and on a red and white patterned couch. A man in the center, wearing a light blue fuzzy cardigan and purple pants, holds a coupe glass containing a pink beverage. Other props include a pink tray and a clear glass decanter with a crystal stopper on the coffee table. The overall lighting is subdued, creating a dark, intimate atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but not perfect, as it fails to adhere to some key negative constraints in the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. All the visual elements mentioned are present in the video and described correctly:\n*   **Setting:** A dimly lit room with dark blue walls, framed pictures, and a black shelf with white candles.\n*   **Furniture:** A glass coffee table and a red and white patterned couch.\n*   **Subjects & Props:** The placement of people is correct. The description of the central man's clothing (light blue fuzzy cardigan, purple pants), the coupe glass with a pink beverage, the pink tray, and the glass decanter are all precise and factually correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing a few required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** The instruction asks to indicate the point of view. The caption omits that this is a static, eye-level shot.\n*   **Motion:** The instruction asks to describe motion. The caption does not mention the subtle movements of the people in the scene, such as them talking or gesturing.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It provides a concise, informative description of the scene.\n*   It correctly describes the color, material, and features of notable elements (e.g., \"glass coffee table,\" \"clear glass decanter with a crystal stopper\").\n*   It avoids speculation, frame-specific references (e.g., \"first frame\"), and forbidden terms like \"image.\"\n*   It is written in simple, natural English and is structured as a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by describing the scene as having an \"intimate atmosphere.\" This is an interpretation of the mood, not a direct visual observation.\n*   **Focus on Subject:** The instruction states to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\" While the description of the man's \"light blue fuzzy cardigan and purple pants\" is accurate, it could be considered excessive detail on a subject, shifting focus away from the overall scene.\n*   **Omission of Required Details:** As noted under \"Completeness,\" it fails to include the point of view and a description of motion, both of which are requested in the instructions.",
