The ancient-looking stone wall in the foreground is dark and damp, overlooking a steep, green grassy embankment that leads down towards the urban landscape.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a high-quality description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate. It correctly identifies all key visual elements: the high vantage point, the wide and wet stone parapet, the overcast sky, the green grassy embankment, and the dense city in the background. The description of the subject's motion—riding along the wall and then descending the slope—is precise. Details like the orange bicycle and its green-rimmed wheels are also captured correctly.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive and covers all required aspects of the scene. It establishes the point of view, the outdoor setting, the weather conditions (overcast, wet ground), and the time of day (daytime). It logically describes the scene from the foreground (parapet) to the midground (embankment) and background (city), and includes the primary action without getting lost in unnecessary detail.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full picture of the scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"dramatic\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\"). The term \"ancient-looking\" is an acceptable descriptive term for the style of stonework rather than a subjective opinion.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The primary focus is on the setting, with the person on the bicycle described as an element within that scene, just as instructed.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly identifies the point of view and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Detailing Visuals:** It successfully describes the color (orange, green), material (stone), and condition (wet, damp) of notable elements.\n*   **Motion:** The movement of the cyclist is described clearly and integrated into the overall scene description.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.",
