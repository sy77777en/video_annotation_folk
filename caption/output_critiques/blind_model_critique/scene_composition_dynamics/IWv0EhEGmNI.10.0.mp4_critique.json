    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, and takes place outdoors at night in a dimly lit area with a green night vision effect that casts a monochromatic hue over the scene. The environment features stone or concrete barriers and low walls, with some structures and silhouettes of buildings visible in the background. The ground appears uneven and debris is scattered throughout the area. Occasional bright, glowing green flames or light sources are visible, providing stark contrast against the otherwise dark surroundings. The character’s hands and a firearm are visible in the foreground, rendered in the same green-tinted night vision style. Overlay elements include a heads-up display (HUD) with ammunition count and weapon icons in the lower right corner, as well as a small text overlay with dialogue in red near the bottom center of the view. These overlays are not part of the physical scene but are superimposed for informational purposes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good overall, providing a clear and descriptive overview of the scene. However, it contains several specific violations of the provided instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption accurately describes what appears to be a scene from a first-person video game. The details, such as the night vision effect, the heads-up display (HUD), the presence of a firearm, and the dimly lit environment with barriers, are all consistent and create a coherent picture of the scene.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete. It successfully covers:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly identified as \"first-person POV.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** \"outdoors,\" \"dimly lit area,\" \"stone or concrete barriers,\" \"uneven ground.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** \"at night.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** \"green night vision effect,\" \"glowing green flames,\" \"firearm.\"\n*   **Overlays:** The description of the HUD and text overlays is excellent, detailing their content and position.\n\nThe only potential omission is the description of **motion or scene transitions**. If the video includes character movement, gunfire, or changes in scenery, the caption does not mention it. The instruction states to describe motion if it is present.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has the most room for improvement. While it follows many rules well, it violates several key negative constraints.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n*   It correctly identifies the POV and overlays as instructed.\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than excessive subject detail.\n\n**Where the caption violates the instructions:**\n1.  **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The instruction says to avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\n    *   **Violation:** `The ground **appears** uneven...`\n    *   **Violation:** `...stone **or** concrete barriers...`\n    *   **Violation:** `...glowing green flames **or** light sources...`\n    These phrases introduce uncertainty and options, which the instructions explicitly forbid. The description should be direct (e.g., \"The ground is uneven,\" \"The scene contains concrete barriers\").\n\n2.  **Do Not Explain What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** The instruction is to describe the scene, not analyze its visual impact.\n    *   **Violation:** `...**providing stark contrast** against the otherwise dark surroundings.`\n    This phrase explains the visual effect of the light sources, which falls under analysis rather than pure description.\n\n3.  **Do Not Infer the Role of the Scene Setting:** The instruction is to avoid inferring purpose.\n    *   **Violation:** `...superimposed **for informational purposes**.`\n    While true, stating the *purpose* of the overlays is an inference that the instructions prohibit. It is sufficient to state that they are superimposed overlays.\n\n4.  **Avoid Prohibited Terms:** The instruction is to avoid terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Minor Violation:** `The **video** is presented...`\n    While the prompt asks to describe a \"video,\" the best practice according to the strict rules is to launch directly into the description of the scene itself without referencing the medium (e.g., \"From a first-person POV...\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong attempt but needs refinement to fully comply with the strict constraints. By removing speculative language, analytical phrases, and inferences, it would become a perfect execution of the instructions.",
