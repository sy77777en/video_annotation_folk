    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a focus on a modern, stylish wine cellar. The environment features a tall, illuminated wine rack filled with bottles, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. In the foreground, a sleek countertop holds a glass container with a light blue liquid and a small plate with white snacks, adding a touch of elegance to the scene. The lighting is soft and ambient, suggesting a calm and sophisticated ambiance, likely during the evening. The overall composition highlights the refined and contemporary design of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor wine cellar setting but uses subjective and interpretive language such as \"inviting atmosphere,\" \"sophisticated ambiance,\" and \"elegance,\" which should be avoided. It also fails to describe the point of view and motion; the video is not static but features a slow, smooth pan from left to right, beginning with a close-up on the foreground elements before revealing the full wine rack. The description of the foreground objects is too vague: the \"sleek countertop\" is made of polished black marble, the \"glass container\" is a crystal decanter holding a pale blue cocktail garnished with a sprig of rosemary, and the \"white snacks\" are cubes of artisanal cheese on a small, square ceramic plate. The caption omits key environmental details, such as the dark, textured stone wall behind the wine rack and the polished concrete floor visible throughout the pan. Furthermore, it misses a notable overlay: a small, semi-transparent watermark for \"Vino Designs\" is present in the bottom-right corner throughout the video. The final sentence, \"The refined and contemporary design of the space is highlighted,\" is an inferential statement about the video's purpose, not a description of its content.",
