    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through an outdoor zoo or wildlife park during the daytime. The path transitions from a wooden boardwalk with metal railings to a wider, light-colored paved area. The park is filled with lush, green trees and planters bordered by rough stones. On the left, an animal enclosure features large, artificial rock formations and a tan-colored building. As the view pans right, another enclosure comes into view, fenced with metal railings, containing several deer in a dirt-floored area with a simple shelter.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully adheres to all the specified requirements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It precisely identifies key elements like the \"wooden boardwalk with metal railings,\" \"light-colored paved area,\" \"artificial rock formations,\" and the \"dirt-floored\" deer enclosure. The descriptions of colors (\"tan-colored building,\" \"green trees\") and materials (\"rough stones,\" \"metal railings\") are specific and objective.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and covers all the required aspects from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"first-person POV shot\" and explains its effect (\"as if through the character’s eyes\").\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It clearly establishes the setting as an \"outdoor zoo or wildlife park\" and describes the environment with details like \"lush, green trees\" and various enclosures.\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** It specifies \"daytime\" and the \"overcast\" sky.\n*   **Motion & Transitions:** It effectively describes the camera's movement (\"moves through,\" \"pans right\") and the change in the path's surface, which serves as a subtle transition within the scene.\n*   **Subjects:** It includes subjects (\"several deer,\" \"a few other visitors\") but correctly keeps the focus on the scenery by only mentioning their presence and context without excessive detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates outstanding adherence to the negative constraints and stylistic rules:\n*   **Concise & Coherent:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that flows logically from the general setting to specific details.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"interesting\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The primary focus remains on the environment, with subjects mentioned only to complete the scene.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not infer the purpose or emotional impact of the scene.\n*   **No Overlays:** By not mentioning overlays, it correctly implies their absence in the video.",
