    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a scene viewed from an objective perspective, capturing two figures standing in front of a large aquarium filled with various fish swimming in the background. The aquarium has a tiled wall, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a public aquarium or museum exhibit. The lighting is dim, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere. The two figures appear to be observing the fish, with one figure slightly smaller and closer to the foreground, while the other stands taller and further back. The overall setting is calm and focused on the interaction between the individuals and the aquatic life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main components of the scene—two figures, an aquarium, and an overlay—but it lacks specificity and includes speculative and subjective language contrary to the instructions. The description of an \"objective perspective\" is vague; the video is more accurately captured from a static, eye-level point of view. The caption speculates that the location is \"possibly a public aquarium,\" which should be stated more definitively based on the visual evidence. The \"irregularly shaped object resembling a rock\" is an oversimplification; the video clearly shows a complex, multi-colored coral reef structure. Furthermore, the wall is not tiled but made of dark, smooth concrete, and the \"building\" seen through the tank is actually another, more distant aquarium exhibit across a large hall, creating a layered aquatic view. The description of \"various fish\" is too general and misses the opportunity to mention the prominent, slow-gliding manta ray and a large, shimmering school of silver fish that are central to the visual experience. The caption violates instructions by using emotional descriptors like \"serene and contemplative atmosphere\" and explaining visual effects like \"adding depth.\" An improved description would focus on concrete details, such as the deep blue water illuminated by light rays from above, the figures appearing as dark silhouettes against the bright tank, and the specific, notable marine life visible.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a static, eye-level view of two figures standing in front of a large aquarium. The scene is set indoors, likely in a public aquarium, as evidenced by the dark, smooth concrete walls and the distant view of another aquarium exhibit across a large hall. The deep blue water of the tank is illuminated by light rays from above, highlighting a complex, multi-colored coral reef structure. Prominent marine life includes a slow-gliding manta ray and a large, shimmering school of silver fish. The figures appear as dark silhouettes against the bright tank, observing the aquatic life.",
