    "pre_caption": "The video captures an underwater scene in a clear, vibrant ocean environment. The setting features a coral reef structure at the center, composed of various corals with rough textures and a mix of green and brown hues. Surrounding the reef, numerous small fish swim in different directions, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The water is a deep blue, providing a striking contrast to the lighter sandy ocean floor. The lighting suggests a bright, sunlit day, with sunlight filtering through the water, enhancing the visibility and colors of the marine life. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, highlighting the beauty of the underwater ecosystem.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it accurately describes a plausible underwater scene, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and misses one important required element.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of a typical underwater coral reef scene. The elements described—coral, small fish, sandy floor, and sunlit water—are factually consistent and create a coherent picture of the environment.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but has one significant omission:\n*   **Missing Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, etc.) and how it influences the viewer's perception. The caption fails to include this detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most significant failures. It violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n**Violations:**\n\n1.  **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses several:\n    *   \"**vibrant** ocean environment\"\n    *   \"**striking** contrast\"\n    *   \"**serene** and natural\"\n    *   \"**beauty** of the underwater ecosystem\"\n\n2.  **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instructions say to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'.\" The caption uses a similar term:\n    *   \"The lighting **suggests** a bright, sunlit day...\" This is an inference, not a direct observation. It should be stated more factually, such as \"Sunlight filters through the water.\"\n\n3.  **Explaining What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** The instructions clearly state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption violates this rule multiple times:\n    *   \"...**enhancing** the visibility and colors of the marine life.\" (Explains the effect of the light).\n    *   \"...**highlighting** the beauty of the underwater ecosystem.\" (Directly uses the forbidden word \"highlighting\").\n\n4.  **Inferring the Role of Scene Elements:** The instructions state, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The caption does this by explaining the purpose of certain elements:\n    *   \"...**adding dynamic movement** to the scene.\" (Explains the role of the fish).\n    *   \"...**providing a striking contrast**...\" (Explains the role of the water color).\n\n**What the Caption Did Correctly:**\n\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery over detailed subject descriptions.\n*   It combines details into a cohesive description.\n\n### Corrected Example\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a static underwater point of view, the scene is set in an ocean environment with clear, deep blue water. A coral reef structure with a rough texture and a mix of green and brown colors sits at the center, surrounded by a light-colored sandy ocean floor. Sunlight filters through the water from above. Numerous small fish swim in various directions around the reef.",
