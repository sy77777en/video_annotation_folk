A single, focused light source from the right illuminates two figures against a pitch-black background. On the left, a young boy in a ribbed jacket is seen in profile, looking towards the right. Beside him is a figure wearing a dark coat, whose head is completely obscured by a dense wrapping of a string-like or wire-like material.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n### Caption Evaluation\n\nThe caption is very good but has one specific violation of the instructions and a minor area for improvement in conciseness.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the black-and-white color scheme, the over-the-shoulder point of view, the dark and undefined setting, and the single, focused light source from the right. The descriptions of the two figures—the boy in the ribbed jacket and the figure with the wrapped head—are precise. The mention of the out-of-focus shoulder in the foreground and the boy's change in expression are also correct observations of the scene's content and motion.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the essential elements requested:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"over-the-shoulder POV.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Described as a \"dark, undefined space\" with a \"pitch-black background.\"\n*   **Visual Elements:** The black-and-white style, focused lighting, and the texture of the boy's jacket are all included.\n*   **Subjects:** The placement and key features of the two figures are described without excessive detail.\n*   **Motion:** The boy's changing expression and upward glance are noted.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but there is one clear violation.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It avoids emotional adjectives (e.g., it says \"wide eyes\" which is a physical description, not \"scared eyes\" which is an emotional inference).\n    *   It correctly identifies the POV and describes the setting, lighting, and motion.\n    *   It does not speculate or infer the purpose of the scene.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Ambiguous Options\":** The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The caption describes the head wrapping as a \"string-like **or** wire-like material,\" which directly violates this rule. It should have committed to one description (e.g., \"string-like material\") or used a more general term that encompasses both possibilities without presenting an option.\n    *   **Minor Wordiness:** The opening, \"From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead,\" is slightly redundant. The term \"over-the-shoulder POV\" already implies the camera's position. A more concise opening would be \"From an over-the-shoulder point of view...\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent in its accuracy and completeness but fails on one specific negative constraint regarding ambiguity. Fixing that single phrase would make it fully compliant with the instructions.",
