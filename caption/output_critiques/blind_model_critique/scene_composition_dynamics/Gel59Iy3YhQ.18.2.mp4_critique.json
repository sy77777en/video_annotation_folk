    "pre_caption": "In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a vast, dark, and foggy indoor chamber. Numerous thin, dark cables descend from the high, unseen ceiling to the dark, reflective floor. At the bottom of each cable rests a dark, cubic box with a single glowing red light. High above, near a bright, hazy light source at the top center of the room, pale, human-like figures hang suspended in the gloom. A small figure runs across the floor, navigating the grid-like arrangement of the boxes. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic color scheme, dominated by shades of grey and black.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly follows the instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes a complex scene by breaking it down into its core components: the chamber, cables, boxes, figures, and the main character. The details, such as the \"dark, reflective floor,\" \"cubic box with a single glowing red light,\" and \"pale, human-like figures,\" are specific and factually descriptive.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally complete and covers all required aspects of the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"side-view gaming video\" perspective and explains how it captures the scene \"in profile.\"\n*   **Setting:** It clearly establishes the setting as a \"vast, dark, and foggy indoor chamber.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It details the cables, boxes, light source, and suspended figures, including their color, shape, and placement.\n*   **Motion:** It includes the movement of the \"small figure\" running across the floor.\n*   **Style:** It effectively notes the \"monochromatic color scheme.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres strictly to all rules:\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery, providing just enough context for the subject without excessive detail.\n*   It successfully combines details from the entire video into a unified description without referring to specific frames.\n*   It correctly omits any mention of overlays, as none were described, and avoids inferring the purpose of the location.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions to create a clear, concise, and comprehensive video description.",
