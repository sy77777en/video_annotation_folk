    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a cozy, rustic living room. The environment features wood-paneled walls and a brick fireplace, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. A soft, orange glow from a floor lamp illuminates the room, complementing the earthy tones of the decor. A comfortable sofa with a plaid blanket and a wooden coffee table add to the homely feel. The scene includes movement, with individuals interacting dynamically within the space, enhancing the lively ambiance. The overall setting suggests a casual, lived-in environment, with a focus on the natural textures and warm lighting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nWhile it correctly identifies some visual elements, it fails to adhere to several core negative constraints, making it a poor fit for the requirements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Cannot Be Assessed:** Without the video, it is impossible to verify if the scene actually contains a \"rustic living room,\" \"wood-paneled walls,\" a \"brick fireplace,\" a \"plaid blanket,\" etc. For this evaluation, it is assumed these physical objects are accurately described.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several required details:\n\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the POV (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld). The caption fails to include this.\n*   **Time of Day:** It implies evening or night by mentioning the lamp, but it does not state the time of day directly.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention if there are any overlays (text, watermarks, etc.), which is a required check.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates numerous specific rules outlined in the instructions.\n\n**1. Violation: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives.**\nThe instruction states: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   The caption uses: \"**cozy**, **rustic**,\" \"**warm**, **inviting** atmosphere,\" \"**soft**, orange glow,\" \"**comfortable** sofa,\" \"**homely** feel,\" and \"**lively** ambiance.\" All of these are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood rather than objective descriptions.\n\n**2. Violation: Inferring the Role or Effect of the Scene.**\nThe instruction states: \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n*   The caption infers purpose and effect with phrases like \"**creating a warm, inviting atmosphere**\" and \"**add to the homely feel**.\" It describes the *feeling* the objects are meant to evoke, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n**3. Violation: Explaining Emphasis or Focus.**\nThe instruction states: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   The caption concludes with \"**with a focus on the natural textures and warm lighting**,\" which is a direct violation of this rule.\n\n**4. Violation: Use of Speculative or Interpretive Language.**\nThe instruction states: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options...\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n*   The caption uses the phrase \"**The overall setting suggests a casual, lived-in environment**,\" which is an interpretation of the scene's meaning, not a description of its visible contents.\n\nIn summary, the caption writer focused on creating a mood and interpreting the scene's intent, which is precisely what the instructions directed them *not* to do. A compliant caption would be a sterile, objective report of the visual facts.",
