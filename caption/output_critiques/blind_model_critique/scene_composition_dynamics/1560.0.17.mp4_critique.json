    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor winter scene in a park-like setting, featuring snow-covered ground and bare trees with a light dusting of snow on their branches. The environment includes a row of hedges and a series of arched buildings in the background, constructed from light-colored stone. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused lighting creating a soft, muted atmosphere. A few benches are placed along a path, and the snow adds a uniform white layer across the landscape. The scene is calm, with minimal movement, as a few individuals walk along the path, dressed in winter clothing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent foundation but lacks the specific visual details and structural elements mentioned in the instructions. It fails to identify the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot that gives the viewer a grounded, observational perspective. The description of the buildings as \"light brown\" is too generic; they are clearly made of aged, reddish-brown brick in a collegiate gothic style, a defining architectural feature. The caption's claim of a \"uniform white layer\" of snow is inaccurate, as the video shows a single set of footprints trailing a person walking away from the camera along the path, and the dark, wrought-iron benches are only partially dusted, not fully covered. Furthermore, the description of motion is understated; while the scene is calm, fine snowflakes are visibly falling throughout, adding a dynamic layer to the stillness. Lastly, the caption completely omits a key overlay: a small, semi-transparent white text in the bottom-left corner that reads \"University Campus,\" which provides essential context to the setting.",

The snow-covered ground and bare trees, lightly dusted with snow, create a tranquil atmosphere.
