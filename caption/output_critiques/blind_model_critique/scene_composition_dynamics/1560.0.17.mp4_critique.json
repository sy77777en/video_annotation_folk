    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor winter scene in a park-like setting, featuring snow-covered ground and bare trees with a light dusting of snow on their branches. The environment includes a row of hedges and a series of arched buildings in the background, constructed from light-colored stone. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused lighting creating a soft, muted atmosphere. A few benches are placed along a path, and the snow adds a uniform white layer across the landscape. The scene is calm, with minimal movement, as a few individuals walk along the path, dressed in winter clothing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe evaluation is based on the assumption that the visual content of the video accurately matches the description in the caption.\n\n### Caption Evaluation\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Cannot be determined. Without the video, it is impossible to verify if the described elements (snow, arched buildings, benches, people walking) are actually present and depicted as stated.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is mostly complete, covering the environment, setting, time of day, and key visual elements.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The caption is missing the **point of view** (e.g., eye-level, high-angle, drone shot). The instructions require this to be specified if relevant, and it is a key component for describing how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows many instructions well but fails on a few critical points.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a good overview of the scene without unnecessary words.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** The description correctly prioritizes the scenery (snow, trees, buildings) over the subjects (people).\n*   **Subject Description:** The mention of \"a few individuals walk along the path\" is contextual and avoids excessive detail, as instructed.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Motion:** It correctly includes the minimal motion of people walking.\n\n**Weaknesses (Violations of Instructions):**\n*   **Use of Speculative Language:** The caption uses the phrase \"**appears to be** overcast.\" The instructions explicitly state: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" It should have stated definitively, \"The time of day is overcast.\"\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The caption describes a \"**soft, muted atmosphere**\" and a \"**calm**\" scene. The instructions state: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" \"Atmosphere\" and \"calm\" are interpretations of the mood, not objective descriptions of visual facts. A better description would focus on the visual cause, such as \"diffused lighting under an overcast sky.\"\n*   **Meta-Description:** The caption begins with \"The video captures...\" While not explicitly forbidden, the best practice according to the instructions is to describe the scene directly (e.g., \"An outdoor winter scene is set in a park...\") rather than describing the video's action of capturing it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates several key negative constraints in the instructions. While it successfully describes the basic visual elements, its use of speculative language (\"appears to be\") and subjective adjectives (\"soft, muted atmosphere,\" \"calm\") directly contradicts the rules. Additionally, the omission of the point of view makes the description incomplete.",
