    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting featuring a traditional Korean pavilion surrounded by lush greenery. The pavilion, with its ornate, multi-tiered roof and vibrant red columns, stands on a stone platform. The roof is intricately decorated with colorful patterns, adding to its cultural significance. The environment is a serene garden or park, with tall trees providing a canopy of green leaves, allowing dappled sunlight to filter through. The time of day is likely midday, as the sunlight is bright and casts soft shadows. The scene is tranquil, with no visible movement, emphasizing the natural beauty and architectural elegance of the pavilion amidst the verdant landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it accurately describes the visual content of a Korean pavilion in a park, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and stylistic requirements of the prompt.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is flawed:\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the pavilion (multi-tiered roof, red columns, stone platform, colorful patterns) and the environment (greenery, trees, dappled sunlight) is visually accurate for such a scene.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is incomplete because it **fails to mention the point of view** (e.g., eye-level shot, low-angle shot), which is a specific requirement in the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several explicit rules outlined in the instructions:\n\n1.  **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule with words like:\n    *   \"**lush** greenery\"\n    *   \"**ornate**, multi-tiered roof\"\n    *   \"**vibrant** red columns\"\n    *   \"**intricately** decorated\"\n    *   \"**serene** garden\"\n    *   \"**tranquil**\"\n    *   \"natural **beauty**\"\n    *   \"architectural **elegance**\"\n\n2.  **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instructions state to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The caption violates this with:\n    *   \"The time of day is **likely** midday...\" This is a speculative guess rather than a factual description of the lighting (e.g., \"The scene is lit by bright, overhead sunlight, creating soft shadows.\").\n\n3.  **Inferring Information Not Visually Present:** The instructions state, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible.\" The caption violates this by stating:\n    *   \"...adding to its **cultural significance**.\" Cultural significance is an abstract concept inferred from the object, not a visible feature.\n\n4.  **Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:** The instructions explicitly say, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption directly violates this rule in its final clause:\n    *   \"...**emphasizing the natural beauty and architectural elegance** of the pavilion...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption writer correctly identified the key elements of the scene but failed to follow the strict, objective, and non-interpretive style demanded by the instructions. The final output reads more like a descriptive piece for a travel blog than the required factual, neutral description. It is filled with the exact type of subjective, speculative, and interpretive language the instructions forbid.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an outdoor setting with a traditional Korean pavilion surrounded by greenery. The pavilion features a multi-tiered roof and red columns, standing on a stone platform. The roof displays colorful patterns. The environment includes tall trees with green leaves, and the scene is lit by bright, overhead sunlight, creating soft shadows. The shot is at eye level, capturing the pavilion and its surroundings.",
