    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the main elements of the scene but violates a few specific negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description is accurate for a typical drone video of a river. It correctly identifies the key natural elements (river, rocks, trees, mountains, sky) and their characteristics (rippling water, green trees, clear sky).\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"filmed by a drone.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Clearly described as an \"outdoor riverside landscape.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Specified as \"during the day, with clear blue skies.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Details like \"smooth, gray stones,\" \"dense green trees,\" and \"rippling and foaming\" water are included.\n*   **Motion:** The river's movement is described (\"flows steadily, its surface rippling and foaming\").\n*   **Overlays:** The absence of overlays is noted.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some issues:\n\n*   **Violation 1:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption violates this directly by saying, \"...**highlighting** the natural textures of water, rocks, and foliage.\"\n*   **Violation 2:** The instruction asks for a description of the scene, not a description of the video itself. Phrasing like \"A video filmed by a drone shows...\" and \"No overlays or artificial elements are present in the video\" is meta-commentary about the video file rather than an immersive description of the scene.\n*   **Violation 3:** The instruction says, \"If the video contains overlay elements... specify that they are overlays.\" This implies you should only mention overlays if they are present. Stating their absence is unnecessary and adds to the meta-commentary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is descriptive, concise, and covers most of the required elements. However, it fails to be a perfect caption because it violates the negative constraints against using words like \"highlighting\" and framing the description as an analysis of a video rather than a direct description of the scene.\n\nA revised version that fully adheres to the instructions would be:\n\n**From a drone's perspective, an outdoor riverside landscape is seen during the day under clear blue skies with scattered white clouds. A river with a rippling and foaming surface flows steadily over rocks, bordered by a wide bank of smooth, gray stones and pebbles. Dense green trees line the river, with low hills and forested mountains visible in the background. The scene is evenly illuminated by sunlight.**",
