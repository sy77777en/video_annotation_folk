The sky displays a gradient of orange, pink, and purple hues, with some clouds visible. At the bottom of the view, a dark fence can be seen below the tree.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main components of the scene, such as the room, window, tree, and sunset. However, it describes the scene as a static image rather than a video. My viewing experience included the gentle swaying of the large tree's branches in a light breeze and the slow, steady drift of the wispy clouds across the sky, details that are missing from the description. The caption could also be more specific; for instance, the \"dark red curtains\" I saw were made of a heavy velvet material, and the \"light-colored frame\" was clearly white-painted wood showing minor signs of weathering. Furthermore, a crucial element of the first-person perspective is omitted: the faint reflection of the room's interior, including the soft glow of a lamp just out of view, which was visible on the window pane. The description of the \"silhouetted fence\" feels slightly disconnected; integrating it with the tree's description would create a more cohesive picture of the view outside the window. Adding these dynamic and specific textural details would provide a much richer and more accurate representation of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From inside a dimly lit room, heavy velvet dark red curtains frame a window with a white-painted wooden frame, showing minor signs of weathering. Through the window, a large tree gently sways in a light breeze, silhouetted against a vibrant sunset. The sky displays a gradient of orange, pink, and purple hues, with wispy clouds slowly drifting across. At the bottom of the view, a dark fence blends with the tree's silhouette, creating a cohesive scene. The faint reflection of the room's interior, including the soft glow of a lamp just out of view, is visible on the window pane, adding depth to the first-person perspective.",
