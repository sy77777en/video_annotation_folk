    "pre_caption": "In an indoor setting, a camera pans slowly to the right across the surface of a light-colored wooden table. Several rectangular white sheets of paper, covered in what appears to be typed text, are laid out in a neat row on the table's surface. The background is completely dark and out of focus, drawing attention to the papers on the brightly lit tabletop. White subtitles are visible as an overlay at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the provided instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is mostly good, but it violates two specific negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the light-colored wooden table, the rectangular white papers with text, the dark background, the slow rightward pan of the camera, and the white subtitles as an overlay.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is comprehensive, covering the point of view (camera pan), setting, key objects, lighting, motion, and overlay elements as required by the instructions. It correctly omits details that are not visible or determinable, such as the time of day.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n    *   It correctly identifies the point of view and motion (\"a camera pans slowly to the right\").\n    *   It specifies the setting (\"In an indoor setting\").\n    *   It describes the color, material, and shape of notable elements (\"light-colored wooden table,\" \"rectangular white sheets of paper\").\n    *   It correctly identifies and describes the overlay (\"White subtitles are visible as an overlay at the bottom of the screen\").\n    *   It avoids emotional language and focuses on objective description.\n\n*   **Where it fails:**\n    1.  **Speculative Language:** The instruction states, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The caption uses the phrase \"covered in **what appears to be** typed text,\" which directly violates this rule. The text is clearly visible as typed text, so the speculation is unnecessary.\n    2.  **Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption says, \"The background is completely dark and out of focus, **drawing attention to the papers on the brightly lit tabletop**.\" This phrase explains the compositional effect (emphasis), which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is very good at accurately and completely describing the visual content of the video. However, it fails to adhere to the instructions perfectly by including a speculative phrase (\"what appears to be\") and by explaining the visual emphasis (\"drawing attention to\"). To be fully compliant, these two phrases should be removed or reworded.",
