    "pre_caption": "The video captures an urban street scene in a city with tall, imposing buildings lining both sides of the road. The setting is outdoors, and the time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky is overcast with a soft, diffused light. The architecture is characterized by a mix of modern and older stone buildings, with intricate details visible on some facades. The street is relatively quiet, with a few cars and bicycles visible, and a pedestrian walking along the sidewalk. Streetlights cast a warm glow, contrasting with the cooler tones of the buildings and pavement. The overall atmosphere is calm, with minimal movement, and the scene maintains a consistent urban aesthetic throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but fails to adhere to several key instructions. It successfully describes a general scene but includes subjective language and speculative phrasing while omitting a required element.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   Without access to the video, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the details described (e.g., time of day, building materials, presence of cars/pedestrians). The feedback below is based solely on how the caption follows the provided instructions.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Information:** The caption completely omits the **point of view** (e.g., eye-level, high-angle, drone shot, dashcam). The instructions explicitly require this detail to be included.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses the phrase \"appears to be late afternoon.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative language like \"it appears,\" \"might be,\" or \"seems to be.\" It should have stated the time of day directly based on the visual evidence (e.g., \"The time of day is late afternoon...\").\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses several subjective words that interpret the scene rather than objectively describing it.\n    *   \"**imposing** buildings\": \"Imposing\" is a subjective interpretation of the buildings' effect on the viewer. \"Tall\" is objective, but \"imposing\" is not.\n    *   \"overall atmosphere is **calm**\": \"Calm\" describes a mood or feeling, which is subjective and emotional. The instruction was to describe the scene's elements, such as \"minimal movement,\" which the caption also does, but the word \"calm\" is an unnecessary and forbidden interpretation.\n    *   \"consistent urban **aesthetic**\": \"Aesthetic\" is a subjective judgment of style and is not a direct, factual description.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The phrase \"contrasting with the cooler tones\" comes close to analyzing the visual composition rather than just describing it, but it is a borderline case. The other violations are more direct.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails on three critical points of the instructions: it omits the required point of view, uses forbidden speculative language (\"appears to be\"), and includes multiple subjective/emotional adjectives (\"imposing,\" \"calm,\" \"aesthetic\"). To be compliant, the caption needs to be rewritten to be more objective, remove all interpretive language, and include the camera's point of view.",
