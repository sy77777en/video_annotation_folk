    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors, featuring a warmly lit room with floral-patterned wallpaper and a framed picture on the wall. The setting suggests a cozy, intimate environment. The lighting is soft, creating a calm atmosphere. A person is present, wearing a teal top and glasses, positioned centrally in the scene. The background includes subtle decorative elements, contributing to the room's homely feel. The overall composition remains consistent, focusing on the person within this domestic setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nWhile I cannot judge the caption's accuracy without seeing the video, I can assess its completeness and adherence to the provided rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n**1. Violation of Negative Constraints:** The caption ignores several explicit \"don't\" rules.\n*   **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words like \"warmly\" lit, \"cozy,\" \"intimate\" environment, \"soft\" lighting, \"calm\" atmosphere, and \"homely\" feel.\n*   **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instruction says to avoid speculative statements like 'it appears' or 'it suggests'. The caption uses the phrase \"The setting suggests a cozy, intimate environment,\" which is a direct violation.\n*   **Inferring Purpose or Role:** The instruction is to \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The caption does this by stating that decorative elements are \"contributing to the room's homely feel.\"\n*   **Explaining Emphasis:** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The final sentence, \"The overall composition remains consistent, focusing on the person within this domestic setting,\" directly explains the shot's focus, which is forbidden.\n\n**2. Incompleteness:** The caption omits required information.\n*   **Point of View:** The POV is not mentioned. The instruction requires specifying if it's a first-person, static shot, handheld, etc.\n*   **Time of Day:** The time of day is not specified. While it mentions \"warmly lit,\" this describes the quality of artificial light, not whether it is day or night.\n*   **Motion:** The caption implies a static scene by saying the \"composition remains consistent,\" but it doesn't explicitly describe the motion (or lack thereof) as instructed.\n\n**3. Incorrect Focus:** The instruction is to \"Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.\" While the description of the person is brief, the final sentence explicitly states the video is \"focusing on the person,\" which shifts the caption's focus away from the setting and contradicts the primary instruction.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it is filled with subjective, emotional, and speculative language while also omitting mandatory details like the point of view and time of day. It incorrectly explains the scene's purpose and focus, directly violating the core principles of the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is set indoors in a room with floral-patterned wallpaper and a framed picture on the wall. The lighting is artificial, and the person in the scene is wearing a teal top and glasses, positioned centrally. The background includes decorative elements. The shot is static, and the time of day is not specified. The focus remains on the setting rather than the individual.",
