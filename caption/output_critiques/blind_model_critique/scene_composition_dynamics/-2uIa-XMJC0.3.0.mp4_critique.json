    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting resembling a modern, industrial-style loft with a skateboarding theme. The environment features a wooden ramp prominently placed in the center, surrounded by various skateboards mounted on the walls. The space is illuminated by natural light streaming through large windows, casting shadows and creating a warm ambiance. The interior includes eclectic elements such as neon signs and a mix of furniture, contributing to a creative and urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the angle and quality of the light. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining a focus on the unique combination of skate culture and contemporary design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor industrial loft setting and its skateboarding theme, but it lacks specificity and includes subjective interpretations contrary to the instructions. For instance, it describes a \"wooden ramp\" without specifying it is a large, light-brown plywood half-pipe with black metal coping. The description of \"eclectic elements\" is too vague; it could have mentioned the worn, brown leather sofa and the DJ turntable setup on a metal cart in the corner. The caption also misses key environmental details like the polished concrete floor and the exposed red brick on one of the walls. While it notes natural light, it fails to describe the large, black-framed, multi-paned factory-style windows from which the low-angle sunlight originates. The point of view is omitted; the video is a slow, steady pan from left to right, which is a crucial detail for understanding the viewer's experience. The caption uses interpretive phrases like \"warm ambiance\" and \"creative and urban atmosphere\" instead of objectively describing the visual elements that create these feelings. Finally, it fails to mention the semi-transparent watermark overlay of a logo in the bottom-right corner.",
