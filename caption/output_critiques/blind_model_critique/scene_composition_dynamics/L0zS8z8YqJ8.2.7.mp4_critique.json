    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good. It successfully follows the detailed instructions by providing a clear, objective, and comprehensive description of the video's content and structure.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It describes two distinct but related scenes (exterior and interior of a train) and logically connects them with a transition. The details provided, such as the train's color, the landscape, the interior features (\"high-backed chairs,\" \"central pillar\"), the nature of the occupants (\"metallic, humanoid figures\"), and the exact text of the overlay, are specific and verifiable.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very thorough and covers nearly all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Environment & Setting:** It clearly distinguishes between the outdoor \"green, hilly landscape\" and the indoor \"observation car.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** It specifies \"during the day.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It effectively describes the train car (\"grey... with a dark stripe\"), the interior (\"dimly lit,\" \"large, panoramic windows,\" \"high-backed chairs,\" \"central pillar\"), and the subjects (\"metallic, humanoid figures\").\n*   **Motion:** It includes motion by describing the train \"traveling on tracks\" and the \"passing scenery.\"\n*   **Scene Transition:** It explicitly notes that \"The scene transitions from an exterior view to the interior,\" which is a key requirement for multi-part scenes.\n*   **Overlays:** It correctly identifies the overlay, its position (\"at the bottom of the screen\"), and its content (\"displays the text 'A fully glazed viewing platform'\").\n\nThe only minor element missing is a specific description of the **point of view** (e.g., \"a side-view tracking shot,\" \"a static interior shot\"). While not a major omission, adding this would make it perfectly complete according to the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates excellent adherence to the stylistic and content-based rules:\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** The description flows logically from the general exterior to the specific interior in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words. For example, it uses \"dimly lit\" instead of \"moody\" and \"metallic, humanoid figures\" instead of \"creepy robots.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** The description \"metallic, humanoid figures\" is a perfect example of describing what is visible without inferring identity, purpose, or status (e.g., it avoids calling them robots, androids, or mannequins).\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and key objects, giving just enough context for the subjects (\"occupied by... figures looking out\") without excessive detail.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and correctly uses \"overlay\" to describe the on-screen text.\n*   **No Inferred Purpose:** It does not speculate on the purpose of the train or the journey.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that masterfully balances detail with conciseness while strictly following a complex set of rules. Its primary strength lies in its objective, factual, and well-structured description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a grey train car with a dark stripe moving along tracks through a lush, hilly landscape dotted with trees in daylight. The scene smoothly transitions from an exterior view to the interior of an observation car, which is dimly lit and features expansive, panoramic windows. Inside, rows of high-backed chairs are occupied by metallic, humanoid figures gazing at the passing scenery. A central pillar is positioned in the middle of the car. An overlay at the bottom of the screen reads \"A fully glazed viewing platform.\" The point of view shifts from a side-view tracking shot of the train to a static interior shot within the observation car.",
