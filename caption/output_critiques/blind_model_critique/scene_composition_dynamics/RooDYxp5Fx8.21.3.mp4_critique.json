    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a quiet, outdoor street lined with traditional Japanese buildings. The environment is clean and well-kept, with smooth gray pavement and a clear blue sky indicating daytime. On one side, a shop with large windows and warm yellow lighting displays pottery and art pieces inside, while outside, a table covered in a red-and-white striped cloth holds various small items. The street is bordered by low-rise structures with neutral-colored facades, wooden accents, and tiled roofs. Overhead, power lines stretch across the road, and a few signs with Japanese text are visible. In the distance, green hills rise beyond the end of the street, and leafy trees add natural color to the scene. No overlays or digital elements are present, and the overall atmosphere is calm and orderly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview, but it misses some of the finer dynamic and textural details I imagine seeing in the video. While it correctly identifies the first-person point of view, it describes the movement as simply \"moves along,\" whereas the video likely features a more natural, walking-like motion with a subtle vertical bob and slow, deliberate pans to the left and right, lingering on details like the pottery shop. The caption also omits the crucial interplay of light and shadow; with a \"clear blue sky,\" I would expect to see sharp, dark shadows cast by the buildings and the intricate web of overhead power lines stretching across the pavement, which would add depth and texture to the scene. The description of the shop stall is a bit vague; the \"various small items\" on the red-and-white striped cloth are likely more distinct in the video, perhaps identifiable as small ceramic tea cups or painted wooden trinkets. Furthermore, while the street is \"quiet,\" it is probably not entirely devoid of life or movement; I imagine seeing a *noren* curtain in a distant doorway gently fluttering in a breeze or a single bicycle parked against a wall, small details that would enhance the sense of a lived-in space without contradicting the overall calm atmosphere.",
