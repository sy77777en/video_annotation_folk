    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, exploring an underwater environment. The setting is a vibrant, alien-like ocean floor, featuring towering rock formations and scattered coral structures. The scene is illuminated by bioluminescent marine life, casting a soft glow across the surroundings. Various aquatic plants and creatures, some glowing in shades of green and blue, add to the otherworldly atmosphere. The sandy seabed is dotted with patches of seaweed and small, luminescent clusters. The water is clear, allowing for a wide view of the underwater landscape. Overlay elements include a red framing at the top and bottom of the screen, suggesting a helmet or visor, enhancing the immersive experience.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and the general alien underwater environment, but it misses several key dynamic and specific visual elements. The description of the overlay as \"red framing\" is too general; the video shows a more complex, angular heads-up display with a semi-transparent red tint, which includes white digital readouts for depth and pressure in the corners, and calling it a \"visor\" is an inference. The caption also omits the most prominent subject: a very large, dark, manta-ray-shaped creature with glowing orange veins that glides slowly through the upper portion of the scene, drawing the viewer's focus. Furthermore, the description lacks a sense of motion, failing to mention the constant forward drift of the viewpoint, the small, shimmering particles suspended in the water, or the way the long, ribbon-like seaweed sways rhythmically in the current. Finally, while it mentions \"towering rock formations,\" it neglects to describe their specific texture, which is smooth and obsidian-like, contrasting with the rough, porous texture of the scattered, brain-like coral structures.",
