    "pre_caption": "The video is set inside a dimly lit room. A woman with reddish-brown hair tied back is visible, wearing a blue collared shirt beneath a brown canvas jacket. A wall with a light switch can be seen in the background. The perspective shifts slightly, bringing the back of the brown jacket into closer view, revealing a pocket detail and a small, square logo patch.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good attempt, but it fails to follow several key instructions. While it accurately describes the visual elements, its focus and structure do not align with the provided guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The description of the woman's clothing (colors, materials), her hair, and the background elements (wall, light switch) is accurate and specific.\n*   The description of the motion (\"perspective shifts slightly\") and the newly revealed details (pocket, logo patch) is also correct.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption mentions that the \"perspective shifts\" but fails to define the overall point of view (e.g., handheld, static shot, close-up).\n*   **Missing Setting Details:** The description of the environment is minimal (\"dimly lit room,\" \"wall with a light switch\"). The instructions ask for a description of the overall scene and setting, but the caption provides very little information about the room itself.\n*   **Missing Time of Day:** While \"dimly lit\" is mentioned, the time of day is not specified.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Incorrect Focus:** The primary failure is the caption's focus. The instructions explicitly state, \"**Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions**\" and \"ensure their placement and context complement the scene **without excessive detail**.\" This caption does the opposite; it focuses almost entirely on the woman and her jacket, with the setting being a minor, secondary detail.\n*   **Introductory Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video is set...\", which is a meta-description. The instructions ask for a direct description of the scene itself, not a description of the video as an object.\n*   **Lack of Integration:** The caption describes the subject and then the camera movement separately. A better caption would integrate the subject into the description of the scene and the camera's movement more fluidly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not good because it fundamentally misunderstands the main directive to prioritize the setting over the subject. It provides a detailed description of a person, which was explicitly discouraged, while offering only a minimal description of the environment.\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that better follows the instructions:\n\n**From a close-up, handheld point of view, the scene is set within a dimly lit room with plain interior walls and a visible light switch. The camera centers on a person wearing a brown canvas jacket over a blue collared shirt. The perspective shifts slightly, moving closer to the back of the jacket to reveal details like a pocket and a small, square logo patch.**",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit room with plain walls and a visible light switch, the scene unfolds from a close-up, handheld perspective. The focus is on the setting, where the camera subtly shifts to reveal a person in a brown canvas jacket over a blue collared shirt. As the perspective moves closer, details like a pocket and a small, square logo patch on the jacket come into view, enhancing the room's understated ambiance.",
