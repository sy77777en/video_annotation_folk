    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a softly lit room with muted blue and gray tones. The background features a blurred wall and a dark blue vertical surface, possibly a door or partition, along with a simple chair with a dark frame and horizontal slats. The environment is uncluttered, with smooth surfaces and minimal decoration. A stylized figure with a pale, matte-textured face, round glasses, and short dark hair stands centrally, facing forward. The figure’s shirt is light-colored with a small pocket and subtle button details. The lighting is even, with no strong shadows, and the overall atmosphere is calm and quiet. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the indoor setting, muted color palette, and central figure, but it oversimplifies the visual details and misses key dynamic elements. It fails to specify the point of view, which is an eye-level shot that slowly pushes in, creating a growing sense of focus on the figure. The description of the figure as \"stylized\" is vague; it is a 3D animated character, and the caption omits the subtle animations, such as a slow blink and a slight, rhythmic rise and fall of the shoulders suggesting breathing, which give the character life. While the lighting is described as \"even,\" it misses the soft key light from the left that casts a faint, diffused shadow under the chin and a subtle rim light that separates the figure's right shoulder from the dark blue background panel. The background elements are also under-described; the \"blurred wall\" has a visible, fine-grained plaster texture, and the \"simple chair\" is a specific mid-century modern design made of light-colored wood. Finally, the use of \"calm and quiet\" is a subjective interpretation, which should be avoided in favor of describing the lack of significant motion or activity in the scene.",
