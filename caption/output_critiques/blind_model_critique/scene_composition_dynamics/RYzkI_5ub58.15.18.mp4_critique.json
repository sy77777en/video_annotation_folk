    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view of a vast, icy landscape. The setting is outdoors, featuring large, white ice formations surrounded by dark, cold water. The ice is textured with cracks and crevices, and its surface is dotted with numerous small, dark shapes, likely animals, scattered across the expanse. The water is a deep, almost black hue, contrasting sharply with the bright ice. Patches of turquoise water are visible in areas where the ice has melted, adding a striking color contrast. The scene is likely set during daylight, as the ice and water are clearly visible. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the icy environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is a good attempt but contains several significant errors. It successfully captures the general scene but fails to adhere to the strict negative constraints outlined in the prompt.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness\n\n*   **Accuracy:** Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption is visually accurate. It correctly identifies the key elements: a drone's aerial view, an icy landscape, dark water, turquoise meltwater, and small dark shapes on the ice.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption effectively covers the point of view (\"filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view\"), environment (\"outdoors\"), setting (\"vast, icy landscape\"), and notable visual elements (ice texture, water colors). However, it does not mention any motion (e.g., if the drone is moving, if the water is flowing, or if the shapes are moving), which may be an omission depending on the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to follow several critical rules:\n\n1.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption uses the word \"likely\" twice: \"...small, dark shapes, **likely** animals...\" and \"The scene is **likely** set during daylight...\" This violates the rule against uncertainty. It should only state what is visible (e.g., \"small, dark shapes\") and state the time of day definitively if it is clear.\n\n2.  **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption includes several subjective words:\n        *   \"...dark, **cold** water...\" (\"cold\" is an inference, not a visual quality).\n        *   \"...**striking** color contrast.\" (\"striking\" is a subjective judgment).\n        *   \"The overall atmosphere is **serene** and expansive...\" (\"serene\" is an emotional interpretation).\n        *   \"...highlighting the natural **beauty**...\" (\"beauty\" is subjective).\n\n3.  **Explaining Emphasis or Highlights:** The instruction clearly says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The final sentence is a direct violation of this rule: \"**highlighting the natural beauty and isolation of the icy environment.**\" This sentence explains the intended effect and theme of the scene rather than simply describing it.\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"**adding a striking color contrast**\" also explains the *effect* of a visual element, which is a form of highlighting.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails on three key negative constraints: it uses speculative language, includes subjective/emotional adjectives, and explains the scene's emphasis. While it provides a decent visual summary, it does not meet the specific, objective, and descriptive tone required by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption Example (Following All Instructions)\n\nFrom a drone's aerial point of view, the video shows a vast, icy outdoor landscape during daylight. Large, white ice formations, textured with cracks and crevices, are surrounded by dark, almost black water. The surface of the ice is dotted with numerous small, dark shapes scattered across the expanse. In some areas, patches of turquoise water are visible where the ice has melted.",
