    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key textual information displayed on the monitor, including the user's name (Andres Freund), the date (March 29), the summary of the post's content (accidental discovery, upgrade recommendation), and the exact text from the link preview title (\"oss-security - backdoor in upstream xz/liblzm...\"). The description of the visual style—a dark, monochromatic interface with light text acting as the primary light source—is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing one key element required by the instructions.\n\n*   **What it does well:** It effectively describes the setting (\"dark room\"), the main visual element (the computer monitor), and the detailed content on the screen.\n*   **What is missing:** The caption fails to mention the **point of view**. The instructions explicitly ask to indicate the POV (e.g., first-person, static shot). In this case, describing it as a \"static, straight-on shot\" would have fulfilled this requirement.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the negative and positive constraints but fails on one specific point.\n\n*   **Strengths (Rules Followed):**\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"good,\" \"interesting\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery (the room and monitor) rather than subjects.\n    *   It correctly describes the visual elements (the screen's interface) and their characteristics (color, light source).\n    *   It does not infer the purpose or importance of the scene.\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Rules Not Followed):**\n    *   The primary failure is the omission of the **point of view**, which was a specific requirement in the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good in terms of its accuracy, clarity, and adherence to most of the stylistic rules. However, it is not a perfect caption because it fails to include the point of view, a mandatory element according to the provided instructions.",
