    "pre_caption": "In a daytime scene, two dark sea lions interact at a weathered wooden dock situated in greenish water. One sea lion rests on the dock's surface, which features a metal cleat, while the other is partially submerged in the water beside it, creating splashes. A thick, algae-covered piling stands on the right side of the dock. Both animals are positioned with their mouths open, facing one another.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subjects and key scenic elements like the dock and piling, but it lacks dynamism and contextual detail that would be present in a video. The point of view is not specified; a close-up, slightly unsteady handheld perspective would better explain the intimate yet active nature of the scene. The term \"interact\" is vague; a more descriptive phrase like \"barking loudly at one another\" would better convey the action implied by their open mouths. The description feels static, omitting the constant motion of the greenish water lapping against the dock and the subtle shifts in weight of the sea lion resting on the wood. Furthermore, the caption misses the broader environment; the scene likely takes place in a bustling marina, with out-of-focus boats and a distant shoreline that would provide important setting context. Finally, it only mentions \"daytime,\" whereas specifying \"bright sunlight\" would account for the glistening texture of the sea lions' wet, dark coats and the sparkling reflections on the water's surface.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a bright sunlight scene, two dark sea lions are captured in a close-up, slightly unsteady handheld perspective at a weathered wooden dock in a bustling marina. One sea lion rests on the dock's surface, subtly shifting its weight near a metal cleat, while the other is partially submerged in the greenish water beside it, creating splashes as the water laps against the dock. Both animals are barking loudly at one another, their mouths open in animated interaction. A thick, algae-covered piling stands on the right side of the dock, and the glistening texture of the sea lions' wet coats reflects the sunlight. In the background, out-of-focus boats and a distant shoreline hint at the lively marina setting.",
