    "pre_caption": "The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of an urban landscape at sunset. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with numerous high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The sky is a blend of soft pink and orange hues, indicating the time of day as evening. The buildings are primarily modern, with glass facades reflecting the warm colors of the sunset. Construction cranes are prominent, with their metallic structures silhouetted against the sky. The city is bustling, with visible streets and illuminated windows suggesting activity. The overall scene captures the dynamic and evolving nature of the urban environment as day transitions to night.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it is accurate and descriptive in many ways, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints outlined in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness\n\n*   **Good:** The caption successfully identifies and describes the point of view (drone POV), setting (outdoor urban landscape), time of day (sunset/evening), and key visual elements (high-rise buildings, construction cranes, colorful sky).\n*   **Good:** It provides specific details about the elements, such as the \"glass facades\" of the buildings and the \"metallic structures\" of the cranes, which aligns with the instructions.\n*   **Good:** It correctly combines details into a single paragraph to describe the overall scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions (Where it Fails)\n\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n1.  **Violation: Use of Introductory Text.**\n    *   The caption begins with \"The video presents...\", which is introductory text. The instruction states to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The description should begin immediately.\n\n2.  **Violation: Use of Speculative Language.**\n    *   The phrase \"...illuminated windows **suggesting activity**\" is an inference. The instruction explicitly says to \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" The caption should only state the observable fact (illuminated windows) and not what it might suggest.\n\n3.  **Violation: Explaining Emphasis and Inferring a Role.**\n    *   The final sentence, \"The overall scene **captures the dynamic and evolving nature of the urban environment** as day transitions to night,\" is a major violation. This is a direct interpretation of the scene's meaning. The instructions clearly state, \"**Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights**\" and \"**Do not infer the role of the scene setting**.\" This sentence does both.\n\n4.  **Violation: Use of Subjective Adjectives.**\n    *   The use of \"soft pink and orange hues\" is borderline. While \"soft\" is a common descriptor, it can be considered subjective. A more objective description would simply state the colors. The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the instructions:\n\nFrom a drone's point of view, an aerial shot shows an outdoor urban landscape at sunset. The cityscape contains numerous modern high-rise buildings with glass facades and several metallic construction cranes silhouetted against the sky. The sky is a blend of pink and orange, and the building facades reflect these colors. On the ground, streets are visible, and many windows in the buildings are illuminated.",
