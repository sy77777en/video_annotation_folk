    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wide shot of a rugged, coastal landscape under an overcast sky. A green, grassy hill slopes down towards a vast, grey-blue sea. A low wall constructed from dark, stacked stones runs along the hillside. Large, weathered rock formations, some marked with yellow lichen, are scattered across the terrain, particularly on the right side of the scene. Two figures stand on the hill against the backdrop of the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the core elements of the scene, such as the drone's point of view, the coastal setting, and the overcast weather. However, it describes the scene as a static photograph rather than a dynamic video. For instance, it states that \"Two figures stand on the hill,\" whereas in the video, the figures are likely in motion, perhaps walking along the crest of the hill or following the path of the stone wall. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the movement inherent in the environment; it mentions the \"vast, grey-blue sea\" but omits the motion of white-capped waves breaking against the rocky shore below. Similarly, the wind that is characteristic of such a landscape would be visible, causing the green grass on the hill to sway, an important detail that adds life to the scene. The description of the drone shot itself is incomplete; a drone is rarely stationary, and the caption should describe its movement, such as a slow pan across the landscape or a gradual pull-back that reveals the full expanse of the coastline and the isolation of the two figures within it. Incorporating these dynamic elements—the movement of the people, the waves, the grass, and the camera itself—would provide a much more faithful and vivid description of the video content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A drone glides over a rugged coastal landscape under an overcast sky, capturing a sweeping view of the scene. The camera slowly pans across a green, grassy hill that slopes down towards a vast, grey-blue sea, where white-capped waves crash against the rocky shore. A low wall of dark, stacked stones snakes along the hillside, guiding two figures who walk along its path, their movement adding life to the scene. The wind sweeps across the landscape, causing the grass to sway gently. Large, weathered rock formations, some adorned with yellow lichen, are scattered across the terrain, particularly on the right side of the scene. The drone gradually pulls back, revealing the full expanse of the coastline and the isolation of the figures against the backdrop of the dynamic seascape.",
