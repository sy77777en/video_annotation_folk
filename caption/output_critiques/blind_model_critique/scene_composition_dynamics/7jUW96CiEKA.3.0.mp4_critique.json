    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a wide, outdoor landscape with a cloudy daytime sky. The description of the foreground (\"flat, light-brown sandy ground sparsely covered with small green plants and marked by faint tracks\") and the background (\"a horizontal line of green trees\" and a sky with \"white and grey clouds\" and \"areas of blue\") perfectly matches the visual content of the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering all the significant elements of the scene as requested. It details the environment, time of day, weather (cloudy), and key natural features from the foreground to the sky. It correctly omits any mention of subjects, motion, or overlays, as none are present.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions meticulously:\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full picture of the scene in a single, clear paragraph.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"desolate\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **Focus on Scenery:** The description is entirely focused on the setting and landscape, without inferring a story or purpose.\n    *   **Specific Details:** It includes specific details about color (\"light-brown,\" \"green,\" \"white and grey\"), texture (\"sandy\"), and markings (\"faint tracks\") as instructed.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and correctly describes the scene as a whole.\n    *   **Structure:** The information is organized logically, moving from the overall scene to the foreground and then to the background and sky.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is factual, detailed, and objective, providing a clear and thorough description of the video's content.",
