    "pre_caption": "A dark, stylized map of the eastern United States is shown, with faint gray lines representing roads and state borders. The Great Lakes are visible in the upper portion of the map, and the Atlantic coastline is on the right. Overlaying the map, orange text and circles identify \"OFFUT AIR FORCE BASE\" in the west and \"JOINT BASE ANDREWS\" in the east. A dashed orange line connects the two locations, and an orange airplane icon moves from west to east along this line, indicating a flight path between the two bases.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It adheres to the instructions with a high degree of accuracy and precision.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is factually correct. It accurately describes the dark, stylized map, the faint gray lines, the geographical features (Great Lakes, Atlantic coastline), and the specific overlay elements, including their color (orange), content (\"OFFUT AIR FORCE BASE,\" \"JOINT BASE ANDREWS\"), and the animated motion of the airplane icon along the dashed line.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the overall scene (the map), the key static elements (locations, borders), and the dynamic element (the moving icon). It successfully integrates details from the entire video into a single, coherent narrative.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is written in simple, clear English, forming a concise and easy-to-understand paragraph.\n    *   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly focuses on describing the graphical scene (the map) rather than getting lost in unnecessary detail.\n    *   **Overlays:** It perfectly follows the instruction to identify overlays, specifying that the text, circles, line, and icon are \"Overlaying the map.\"\n    *   **Motion:** The movement is described clearly and accurately: \"an orange airplane icon moves from west to east along this line.\"\n    *   **Avoidance of Prohibited Language:** The caption successfully avoids subjective adjectives, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"). It describes what is visually present without inferring purpose or meaning beyond what is shown.\n    *   **Point of View:** While it doesn't use a specific term like \"top-down view,\" the description of a \"map\" inherently establishes this perspective, which is perfectly acceptable and clear.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and thorough, capturing all the essential visual information of the video in a well-structured paragraph.",
