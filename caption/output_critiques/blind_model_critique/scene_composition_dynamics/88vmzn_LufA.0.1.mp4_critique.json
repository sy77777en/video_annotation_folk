    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements in both parts of the scene:\n*   **Scene 1:** Accurately describes the \"circular, rusted metal manhole cover,\" its \"textured grid pattern,\" the \"asphalt surface,\" \"white crosswalk lines,\" and the \"multi-story buildings\" in the background.\n*   **Scene 2:** Precisely details the components of the bomb, including the \"red dynamite sticks,\" \"metal bands,\" multi-colored \"wires,\" and the \"timer unit with a green digital display showing numbers.\" The description of the point of view shifting to an \"overhead view looking down from inside the manhole shaft\" is also perfectly accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It clearly states the initial \"ground-level view\" and the subsequent \"overhead view.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** It establishes the setting as an outdoor \"city street intersection\" during the \"daytime.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It provides detailed, objective descriptions of the manhole cover and the bomb, including their color, material, shape, and texture, as instructed.\n*   **Scene Transition:** It explicitly describes the change in perspective (\"The perspective then shifts...\"), fulfilling the requirement to explain how the scene changes.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption follows the rules with remarkable precision.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is efficient, packing a lot of visual information into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"dangerous,\" \"scary\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"it might be\").\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and key objects over any potential subjects, as instructed.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Describes Transitions:** It clearly explains the hard cut in perspective from the street level to the view inside the shaft.\n*   **Details on Objects:** The description of the bomb is a model example of following the instruction to detail \"color, material, shape, and distinguishing features.\"\n\n**Minor Point for Improvement:**\n*   The phrase \"The video opens with...\" is a very subtle deviation from the instruction to \"describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one.\" While it doesn't mention a \"first frame,\" it does sequence the description chronologically (\"opens with,\" \"then shifts\"). A slightly more integrated approach would be to describe the two distinct views without explicitly marking the beginning of the video. However, given the stark contrast between the two scenes, this chronological approach is natural and highly effective for clarity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is exceptionally good. It is a textbook example of how to follow a complex set of technical instructions for video description. The minor point about sequencing is a very fine detail, and the current phrasing is arguably the clearest way to describe the two distinct parts of the video. The caption is clear, precise, and perfectly aligned with the user's request.",
