    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good but incomplete. It is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements but fails to include key information explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the scene is very accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the room as \"empty\" and \"indoor.\"\n*   The description of the \"grid of small, white square tiles\" on the floor and upper walls is precise.\n*   The \"dark, textured material\" on the lower walls is a correct and non-speculative observation.\n*   The architectural details, such as the \"tiled column,\" \"curved wall,\" and the unique shape of the windows (\"tall, narrow windows with rounded tops and bottoms\"), are all identified correctly.\n*   The description of the light as \"bright, diffuse white\" is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The caption is missing several key components required by the instructions.\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly ask for the POV. The video is a static, first-person shot, which is not mentioned.\n*   **Motion:** The instructions require a description of motion or changes. In this case, the video is completely static. Mentioning this (e.g., \"The static shot shows...\") would fulfill the requirement and add important context.\n*   **Other Elements:** The caption correctly omits details that are not present, such as overlays, weather, or significant props.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent Adherence (to negative constraints):**\n    *   It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n    *   It avoids speculation (e.g., it doesn't guess the room's purpose or the material of the dark wall).\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and is presented as a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery rather than subjects.\n*   **Poor Adherence (to positive requirements):**\n    *   The primary failure is omitting the **point of view**, which was a mandatory element in the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is well-written, accurate, and follows most of the stylistic rules. However, its failure to include the required **point of view** and mention the **static nature** of the shot makes it an incomplete execution of the instructions. While what is written is good, what is omitted prevents it from being a perfect caption according to the provided guidelines.",
