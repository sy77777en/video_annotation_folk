    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting on a rugged, mountainous terrain with a clear view of distant, layered hills under a bright sky, suggesting daytime. The ground is a mix of dirt and patches of green grass. Several horses, equipped with saddles, are scattered across the scene, grazing peacefully. The horses are brown with dark manes, and their saddles are made of leather, adding a rustic element to the natural environment. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the vast landscape providing a sense of openness and tranquility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it captures some visual elements correctly, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and omits required information.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption describes a plausible scene (horses in a mountainous area). However, without the video, it's impossible to verify if the details like \"leather\" saddles, \"dark manes,\" or \"layered hills\" are correct. Assuming they are, the description of the physical objects is adequate.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The instructions explicitly ask to indicate the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, drone shot). The caption fails to mention this, which is a significant omission as it affects how the scene is perceived.\n*   **Incomplete Motion Description:** The caption mentions the horses are \"grazing peacefully,\" which implies slow, natural movement. However, it doesn't describe any camera motion (e.g., static, panning, tracking) or other environmental motion (e.g., wind blowing through the grass).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several core rules outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation - Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"peacefully,\" \"rustic,\" \"serene,\" and \"tranquility.\" These words describe feelings and interpretations rather than objective visual facts, directly contradicting the instructions.\n*   **Violation - Avoid Speculative Statements:** The phrase \"suggesting daytime\" is speculative. The instructions require definitive statements based on visual evidence (e.g., \"under a bright, daytime sky\").\n*   **Violation - Focus on Scenery, Not Interpretation:** The final sentence, \"The overall atmosphere is serene, with the vast landscape providing a sense of openness and tranquility,\" is entirely subjective interpretation. It describes the mood and feeling of the scene, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n\nIn summary, the caption attempts to be descriptive but leans heavily into subjective and emotional language, which is explicitly forbidden. It also misses key required details like the point of view, making it an unsuccessful execution of the provided instructions.",
