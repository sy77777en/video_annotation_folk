    "pre_caption": "The video captures a large group of people, many in dark uniforms with some identifiable as police, moving through a long, dimly lit indoor tunnel. The tunnel features dark, possibly concrete walls, with small, yellow lights mounted at intervals on one side. A series of brighter, white, circular lights are spaced along the dark ceiling, extending into the receding darkness. The densely packed crowd advances deeper into the tunnel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption successfully establishes the core elements of the scene but lacks crucial details that would be present in the video. It fails to specify the point of view, which, from the description of the crowd advancing, is likely a handheld shot from behind the group, creating an immersive perspective for the viewer. The description of the tunnel is vague with the word \"possibly\"; the video would clearly show if the walls are smooth, pre-cast concrete or rough-hewn rock, and the caption should state this definitively. A significant omission is the tunnel floor, which is likely wet concrete, creating distinct reflections of the yellow and white lights that would be a prominent visual feature. While the description of the people is appropriately general, specifying the \"dark uniforms\" as \"tactical gear with helmets\" would add important context without excessive detail. Furthermore, the caption misses the dynamic aspect of the scene; as the camera moves forward, the ceiling lights would pass rhythmically overhead, an effect that is not mentioned. Finally, the caption does not account for potential overlays, such as a news channel watermark or a timestamp in the corner, which are common in this type of footage and would need to be described.",
