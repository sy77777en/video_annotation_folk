    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting, likely an office or conference room, with a focus on a man standing in front of a large whiteboard displaying architectural blueprints. The room is well-lit, suggesting daytime. The whiteboard features detailed drawings of building designs, including floor plans and elevations. In the foreground, there are two holographic models of buildings, rendered in a translucent blue material with a smooth texture, adding a modern, technological element to the scene. The man, dressed in a suit, is positioned centrally, facing the whiteboard, suggesting he is analyzing or presenting the designs. The environment is minimalistic, with a focus on the architectural elements. Overlay elements include text and icons at the bottom of the video, providing additional information or context, but they are not part of the physical scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It violates several core negative constraints and fails to include required information.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Feedback Summary\n\nThe caption correctly identifies key visual elements but fails by including speculative language, interpreting the scene's meaning and the subject's actions, using subjective adjectives, and omitting required details like the point of view and motion.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the physical objects (man in a suit, whiteboard with blueprints, holographic models) appears to be accurate based on the text.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., static shot, eye-level, handheld), which is a mandatory part of the instructions.\n*   **Missing Motion:** The instructions require a description of any motion. The caption describes a static scene, but it is unclear if the holograms rotate, if the man moves, or if the camera pans. This is a significant omission.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption fails to follow these specific rules:\n\n*   **\"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** The caption says the setting is \"**likely** an office or conference room.\" This is a speculative statement.\n    *   **Violation:** It states the lighting is \"**suggesting** daytime.\" This is an inference, not a direct observation.\n    *   **Violation:** It claims the man's posture is \"**suggesting** he is analyzing or presenting the designs.\" This is a major inference about the subject's actions and role.\n\n*   **\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** The caption states there is a \"**focus on** a man...\" and later, a \"**focus on** the architectural elements.\" This explains the scene's emphasis.\n\n*   **\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" / \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"**suggesting he is analyzing or presenting the designs**\" infers the subject's role and actions, which are not explicitly visible.\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"**providing additional information or context**\" infers the purpose of the overlays rather than just describing their appearance.\n\n*   **\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** Describing the environment as \"**minimalistic**\" is a subjective, stylistic judgment.\n    *   **Violation:** Stating the holograms are \"**adding a modern, technological element**\" is an interpretation of their effect on the scene's mood or style.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions, based on the same visual information:\n\nFrom a fixed, eye-level point of view, an indoor, well-lit room is shown. A man in a suit stands with his back to the viewer, positioned centrally in front of a large, white wall-mounted board covered in architectural blueprints. In the foreground, two holographic building models made of a smooth, translucent blue material rotate slowly. An overlay is present at the bottom of the screen, containing white text and icons.",
