    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out over a sunlit, arid outdoor area from a slightly elevated position. The view is partially framed by the dark, metallic form of a weapon held in the foreground. A dirt road runs through the midground, where several vehicles are situated, including a white sedan and larger, military-style trucks. The landscape is dotted with sparse green and brown trees and low, simple structures in the distance. The scene includes several on-screen overlays: a blue minimap with green text is in the bottom-left corner, a blue display with an ammunition count is in the bottom-right, and orange, diamond-shaped icons with numbers float over distant objects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the first-person point of view, the arid environment, the time of day (\"sunlit\"), and all the key visual elements, including the weapon, vehicles, distant structures, and the specific details of the on-screen overlays.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive, covering all required aspects from the instructions. It includes the point of view, setting, environment, time of day, notable objects (weapon, vehicles), and a thorough description of all overlay elements (minimap, ammo count, icons).\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective words (\"beautiful,\" \"intense\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **No Inference:** It correctly describes the trucks as \"military-style\" based on their appearance but does not infer that the scene is a battle or a military operation, strictly adhering to the rule against inferring the scene's role.\n    *   **Focus on Scenery:** The description prioritizes the setting and notable elements over any specific character actions, as instructed.\n    *   **Overlay Description:** The handling of the overlays is exemplary. It correctly identifies them as \"on-screen overlays\" and precisely describes their content, color, and position on the screen.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions precisely. It is factual, detailed, and written in a clear, objective tone.",
