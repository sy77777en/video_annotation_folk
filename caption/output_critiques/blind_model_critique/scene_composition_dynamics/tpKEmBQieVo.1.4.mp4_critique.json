    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and the core action of the parachute deploying, it feels static and misses the dynamic motion inherent in such a video. The description of the parachute inflating is good, but it should also convey the continuous, rapid descent, with the canyon walls appearing to rush upwards past the periphery of the view. The description of the environment, \"steep, dark rock faces,\" is too generic; in the video, these canyon walls likely have a distinct reddish-brown or ochre color and a rugged, striated texture that would add significant visual detail. The phrasing \"looking up from a bright yellow jumpsuit\" is slightly awkward, as it could be interpreted as the jumpsuit being on the ground; clarifying that the viewpoint is from a person wearing the suit would be better. Furthermore, the caption focuses solely on the moment of inflation. The video likely continues, showing the subject steering the parachute by pulling on the black risers to navigate through the canyon. Incorporating this element of controlled flight would provide a more complete and engaging description of the entire scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A dynamic POV shot captures the exhilarating perspective of a person wearing a bright yellow jumpsuit as they rapidly descend through a deep canyon. The white parachute with black lettering inflates overhead, and the canyon walls, with their distinct reddish-brown and ochre hues and rugged, striated textures, seem to rush upwards past the periphery of the view. The scene unfolds outdoors on a clear, sunny day, with the bright blue sky above and the sun causing a significant lens flare. As the person skillfully steers the parachute by pulling on the black risers, they navigate through the canyon, adding a sense of controlled flight to the thrilling descent.",
