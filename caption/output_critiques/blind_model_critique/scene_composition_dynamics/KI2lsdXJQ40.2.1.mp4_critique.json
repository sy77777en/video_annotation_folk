    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors in a cozy, warmly lit living room with wooden flooring and wallpapered walls featuring a subtle pattern. A colorful sofa with floral cushions is positioned against the wall, accompanied by a small wooden coffee table on a green rug. A framed landscape painting hangs above the sofa, adding to the room's homely atmosphere. A staircase with wooden railings descends into the room, suggesting a multi-level home. A window allows natural light to filter in, illuminating the space. The setting is detailed with a few pieces of furniture, including a side table with drawers. The overall ambiance is inviting and domestic, with a focus on the room's decor and layout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, although it is mostly accurate in its description of the visual content.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the setting as an indoor living room with wooden flooring, wallpapered walls, a staircase, a window, a green rug, a wooden coffee table, a side table, and a framed painting.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** It describes the sofa as \"colorful,\" which is true, but misses the more specific detail that it has a striped pattern. It correctly notes the \"floral cushions.\"\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot. This is a specific requirement in the instructions.\n*   **Missing Time of Day:** While it mentions \"natural light,\" it does not explicitly state the time of day (daytime), which is a required element.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n*   **FAILED - Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives:** The caption uses words like \"cozy,\" \"homely,\" \"inviting,\" and \"domestic.\" These are subjective and emotional, which the instructions forbid.\n*   **FAILED - Avoid speculative statements:** The phrase \"suggesting a multi-level home\" is an inference, not a direct observation. This violates the rule against speculative language.\n*   **FAILED - Do not infer the role of the scene setting:** The caption infers the room's role by describing its \"homely atmosphere\" and \"domestic\" ambiance, which is explicitly disallowed.\n*   **FAILED - Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights:** The final sentence, \"with a focus on the room's decor and layout,\" directly explains what the scene emphasizes, which is forbidden.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures the general essence of the room, it fails significantly in following the stylistic and content-based rules, particularly by including subjective analysis, speculation, and meta-commentary about the scene's focus.",
