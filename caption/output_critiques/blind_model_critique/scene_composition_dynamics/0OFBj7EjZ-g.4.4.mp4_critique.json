    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a modern, industrial aesthetic. The environment features a spacious room with a grid-patterned floor and numerous wooden pallets arranged in rows. The pallets are made of light brown wood, showcasing a simple, rectangular shape with visible slats. Above the pallets, abstract, metallic structures with smooth, curved surfaces are suspended, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The walls in the background have a geometric design with angular patterns, contributing to the contemporary feel. The lighting is neutral, suggesting an artificial source, and there are no visible windows or natural light. Overlay elements include text or icons positioned unobtrusively, providing additional information without obstructing the view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately describes the static elements of the industrial-style room, it misses the opportunity to convey the video's motion and point of view, which are crucial for describing a moving picture. Based on the visuals, the shot is a slow, steady dolly movement from left to right, tracking parallel to the rows of wooden pallets. This movement creates a sense of depth and rhythm, guiding the viewer's eye through the space. The caption could also be more specific about the materials; the suspended \"metallic structures\" are not just abstract but appear to be sheets of dark, weathered steel with a non-reflective, matte finish, and the \"grid-patterned floor\" is polished concrete with thin, white lines etched into it. Furthermore, the description of the walls as having a \"geometric design\" is vague; they are painted with large, interlocking triangles and trapezoids in shades of charcoal gray and off-white. A solitary figure is briefly visible walking slowly in the far background between two rows of pallets, which provides a sense of scale to the vast room without being the central focus. Finally, the overlay text \"[15]\" could be more precisely described as being in a simple, white, sans-serif font.",
