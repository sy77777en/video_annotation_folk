    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor rural setting with a wooden fence in the foreground, constructed from rough, weathered planks and posts, some of which are angled and uneven. Beyond the fence, several farm buildings with pitched roofs and simple wooden siding are visible, spaced across a flat expanse of land. The sky is dark and overcast, with heavy clouds and a visible tornado funnel extending from the clouds to the ground, creating a dramatic and tense atmosphere. The ground appears dry and textured, with patches of grass and dirt. A person carrying a bag and a suitcase walks along the fence, positioned to the left of center, moving toward the farm buildings. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, dominated by sepia tones, giving the scene a vintage appearance. There are no overlay elements such as text or icons present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is good but contains several specific errors and omissions that prevent it from fully adhering to the instructions. While it successfully captures the main visual elements, it violates key negative constraints and misses required descriptive components.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Assumed Accuracy:** Assuming the video does show a person, a fence, farm buildings, and a tornado in a sepia-toned rural setting, the description of these physical elements is accurate and detailed.\n*   **Factual Detail:** The description of the fence (\"rough, weathered planks and posts, some of which are angled and uneven\") and the buildings (\"pitched roofs and simple wooden siding\") is precise and objective, which aligns well with the instructions.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Missing Point of View (POV):** This is a significant omission. The instructions explicitly require specifying the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, tracking shot) and how it influences the viewer's perception. The caption fails to mention this.\n*   **Missing Motion Details:** While it mentions the person \"walks,\" it does not describe other potential motion. For a scene with a tornado, details about the movement of the funnel, clouds, or wind effects on the environment (like dust or swaying grass) are likely present and should be included.\n*   **Incomplete Time of Day:** The caption mentions a \"dark and overcast\" sky but does not explicitly state the time of day (e.g., daytime, dusk). While implied, a more direct statement like \"During the daytime, the sky is dark and overcast...\" would be more complete.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The phrase \"**creating a dramatic and tense atmosphere**\" is a direct violation of this rule. \"Dramatic\" and \"tense\" are subjective interpretations of the mood, not objective descriptions of the scene.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses the phrase \"**The ground appears dry...**\" The instructions explicitly forbid using words like \"it appears.\" The statement should be definitive, such as \"The ground is dry...\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid explaining what the scene emphasizes\":** The phrase \"**giving the scene a vintage appearance**\" is an interpretation of the *effect* of the sepia tones. The instruction is to describe what is visible, not to explain the stylistic impression it creates. A more compliant description would simply state that the color scheme is monochromatic and dominated by sepia tones.\n*   **Structure:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, which correctly follows the formatting instruction. It also successfully avoids referring to specific frames or using forbidden terms like \"image.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an outdoor rural setting with a wooden fence in the foreground, made from rough, weathered planks and posts, some of which are angled and uneven. Beyond the fence, several farm buildings with pitched roofs and simple wooden siding are visible, spaced across a flat expanse of land. The sky is dark and overcast, with heavy clouds and a tornado funnel extending from the clouds to the ground. The ground is dry and textured, with patches of grass and dirt. A person carrying a bag and a suitcase walks along the fence, positioned to the left of center, moving toward the farm buildings. The scene is captured in a static shot, enhancing the viewer's focus on the unfolding events. The tornado funnel and clouds exhibit motion, with visible wind effects such as dust and swaying grass. During the daytime, the monochromatic color scheme is dominated by sepia tones. There are no overlay elements such as text or icons present in the video.",
