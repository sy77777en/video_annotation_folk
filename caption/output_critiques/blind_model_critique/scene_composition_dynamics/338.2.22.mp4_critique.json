    "pre_caption": "The video presents a third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height in an indoor setting, specifically a bustling restaurant. The environment features warm lighting with intricate wooden paneling and decorative elements on the walls, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The ceiling is adorned with ornate designs, adding to the restaurant's traditional aesthetic. Tables are arranged throughout the space, occupied by patrons engaged in conversation and dining. The character, wearing a blue backpack and a white shirt, moves through the scene, interacting with the lively surroundings. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the indoor lighting suggests a well-lit, possibly evening setting. The overall ambiance is vibrant, with a mix of people and activity contributing to the dynamic scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good foundation but misses key visual details and includes speculative and subjective language contrary to the instructions. The description of the restaurant as having \"intricate wooden paneling\" is accurate, but it fails to specify that the paneling is a dark, lacquered wood forming a lattice pattern, and the \"decorative elements\" are specifically red paper lanterns casting a soft glow and framed black-and-white photographs of cityscapes. The caption correctly identifies the point of view but omits the subtle, rhythmic sway of the camera that syncs with the character's walking motion. Furthermore, you've missed a crucial overlay: a semi-transparent, circular mini-map in the bottom-left corner displaying the restaurant's layout with a white arrow indicating the character's position. The statement that the setting is \"possibly evening\" is speculative; you should instead describe the visible lighting, such as the warm, low-intensity light from the lanterns and recessed ceiling fixtures, without inferring the time of day. Finally, the use of subjective words like \"cozy,\" \"inviting,\" and \"vibrant\" should be replaced with objective descriptions of the scene's components, such as noting that most tables are occupied by patrons and that staff are seen moving between the kitchen and dining area.",
