The primary visual element is a bookshelf densely packed with books, their spines facing outward; text like \"BIG BEN\" is partially visible on one spine.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and follows the instructions with a high degree of precision.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It provides specific, verifiable details that ground the description in reality, such as the \"white and grey\" color of the helmet, the presence of a \"clear visor,\" and the partially visible text \"BIG BEN\" on a book spine. These details suggest careful observation of the source video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is largely complete, covering the most critical aspects of the scene as required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It correctly identifies the setting as \"indoors\" and the environment as a \"dimly lit space\" with a \"bookshelf densely packed with books.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It effectively describes the astronaut helmet (color, features) and the books. It also notes the lighting conditions (\"low, casting shadows and highlighting reflections\").\n*   **Subjects:** The individual is described in a neutral, contextual way (\"Positioned in profile before the bookshelf\"), which aligns perfectly with the instruction to focus on the setting.\n*   **Motion:** The caption successfully incorporates motion by stating, \"Throughout the video, the individual's head shifts slightly.\"\n\nThe only minor omission is the **point of view**. While not a distinct type like a drone or dashcam shot, adding that it is a \"static, medium shot\" could provide slightly more context for the viewer. However, its absence does not significantly detract from the quality of the description.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThis is where the caption truly excels. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of both the positive and negative constraints.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is contained in a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to read while being rich in detail.\n*   **Objective Language:** It completely avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. Words like \"dimly,\" \"densely,\" and \"low\" are used as objective descriptors of light and space.\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption refrains from using speculative phrases like \"it seems\" or \"it might be.\" It only states what is visibly present.\n*   **No Inferred Role:** It correctly describes the setting as a \"space\" with a bookshelf, without inferring that it is a library, study, or bedroom.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The person is treated as an element within the scene rather than the primary subject, fulfilling the instruction to focus on the setting.\n*   **Correct Handling of Motion:** It uses \"Throughout the video\" to describe movement, correctly combining details from the video's duration without referring to specific frames.\n*   **No Overlays Mentioned:** By not mentioning overlays, it correctly implies there are none.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, objective, and well-structured, capturing the essential visual information of the scene without violating any of the negative constraints. The feedback is overwhelmingly positive, with only a very minor point on specifying the point of view as a potential, but not essential, addition.",
