    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting in a serene, natural environment during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon, characterized by soft, diffused lighting. The scene features a tranquil river meandering through a lush landscape, bordered by dense greenery and trees with varied foliage. The river's surface reflects the muted sky, creating a gentle contrast with the surrounding earthy tones. The terrain is slightly uneven, with patches of grass and sandy banks. In the background, a line of trees and shrubs adds depth to the scene, while a few animals are visible near the water, blending harmoniously with the environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and undisturbed, with no visible human presence or structures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it successfully describes a natural scene, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and omits required information.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption provides a description of a plausible nature scene. It accurately identifies common elements like a river, trees, and animals. However, its heavy reliance on subjective language (e.g., \"serene,\" \"tranquil\") makes its factual accuracy questionable, as these are interpretations rather than objective descriptions.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in two critical areas:\n1.  **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the POV (e.g., first-person, drone shot, stationary). The caption completely omits this.\n2.  **Motion:** The instructions state to describe motion, such as \"wind blowing through trees or waves crashing.\" As this is a video, some form of motion (like the river flowing or animals moving) is almost certain to be present, yet the caption describes a static scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates several explicit rules:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption is filled with subjective words that interpret the mood of the scene rather than describing it factually.\n    *   **Examples:** \"serene,\" \"tranquil,\" \"lush,\" \"gentle contrast,\" \"harmoniously,\" \"calm,\" \"undisturbed.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption uses speculative and ambiguous phrasing, which is strictly forbidden.\n    *   **Example:** \"during what **appears to be** early morning **or** late afternoon.\" The instructions prohibit both \"it appears\" and \"A or B\" options.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption interprets the compositional effect of certain elements instead of just describing them.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...**creating a gentle contrast** with the surrounding earthy tones\" and \"a line of trees and shrubs **adds depth to the scene**.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail\":** The description of the animals \"blending harmoniously with the environment\" is an interpretive statement, not a factual description of their placement.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example Following All Instructions\n\nTo illustrate the difference, here is a revised version of the caption that adheres to the rules:\n\nFrom a stationary, eye-level point of view, the outdoor scene captures a river in a natural setting under soft, diffused light. The river runs through a landscape bordered by dense green trees and varied foliage. The water's surface reflects the sky. The surrounding terrain consists of uneven ground with patches of grass and sandy banks. In the background, a line of trees and shrubs is visible. A few animals are located on the ground near the water. There are no human-made structures present.",
