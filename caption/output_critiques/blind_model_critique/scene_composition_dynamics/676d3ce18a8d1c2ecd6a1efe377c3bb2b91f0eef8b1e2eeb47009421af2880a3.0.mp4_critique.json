    "pre_caption": "The video, filmed by a drone, captures an outdoor scene featuring a historic church with a tall, pointed spire, surrounded by a grassy landscape. The setting is a cemetery with neatly arranged headstones, visible paths, and clusters of mature trees providing shade. The church, constructed from stone, exhibits a traditional architectural style with a slate roof. The time of day is likely midday, as indicated by the bright, even lighting and clear skies. The drone's aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings, highlighting the orderly layout of the cemetery and the natural greenery that frames the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but contains a few specific violations of the instructions. It successfully captures the main elements of the scene but fails on some key negative constraints.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate based on the scene it describes. It plausibly depicts a drone shot of a church within a cemetery, and the details provided (stone construction, spire, slate roof, headstones) are consistent and create a coherent visual.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It successfully includes:\n*   **Point of View:** \"filmed by a drone\" and \"drone's aerial perspective.\"\n*   **Setting:** \"outdoor scene,\" \"cemetery,\" with descriptive features like \"grassy landscape,\" \"headstones,\" \"paths,\" and \"mature trees.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** \"midday,\" supported by evidence (\"bright, even lighting and clear skies\").\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The church is described with its material (\"stone\"), shape (\"tall, pointed spire\"), and features (\"slate roof\").\n\nHowever, it may be incomplete if the video contains motion. The caption describes a static scene, but the instructions require describing motion (e.g., the drone's movement, wind in the trees). If the drone was panning, tilting, or flying forward, that detail is missing.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some clear issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a concise, single-paragraph description.\n*   It avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than subjects.\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It correctly identifies the point of view and describes its effect on the viewer (\"offers a comprehensive view\").\n\n**Where it fails:**\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The instruction explicitly forbids phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\" The caption uses \"**likely** midday,\" which is a speculative term. Based on the evidence provided (\"bright, even lighting\"), it should have been stated definitively as \"The time of day is midday.\"\n2.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The instruction is very clear on this point. The final sentence of the caption states that the drone's perspective is \"**highlighting** the orderly layout of the cemetery...\" This is a direct violation, as it explains the compositional effect of the shot rather than simply describing what is visible.\n3.  **Minor Violation of \"Avoid inferring\":** The use of \"historic\" and \"traditional architectural style\" are minor interpretations rather than purely objective visual descriptions. While generally acceptable, a stricter adherence would focus only on observable features.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good in its descriptive quality and structure but fails to adhere to two critical negative constraints in the instructions: avoiding speculative language and refraining from explaining what the scene highlights. To be fully compliant, it would need to remove the word \"likely\" and rephrase the final sentence to be purely descriptive.",
