    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is partially good as it correctly identifies the basic setting and lighting. However, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and lacks the level of detail required by the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is accurate in its high-level description. The scene is indeed an indoor, warmly lit room with patterned wallpaper, framed art, and decorative plates. The observation that the scene is static and the time of day is indeterminate is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete. It omits several notable visual elements that are required by the instructions:\n    *   It fails to mention the **point of view**, which is a static, eye-level shot.\n    *   It does not describe the **key furniture**, specifically the dark wooden furniture at the bottom of the scene and the lit lamp with a cream-colored shade resting on it.\n    *   It lacks specific details about the **color and features** of the objects it mentions. For example, it doesn't specify that the wallpaper is a light color, that one artwork has an ornate gold frame, or that the decorative plates are blue and white.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses subjective and emotional adjectives. The instruction explicitly states, \"**Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.**\"\n    *   Words like \"**cozy**,\" \"**intimate feel**,\" \"**gentle** shadows,\" and \"**homeliness**\" are interpretations of the mood, not objective descriptions of the scene.\n*   **Violation:** The caption infers the purpose or effect of an object. The instruction states, \"**Do not infer the role of the scene setting.**\"\n    *   The phrase \"**adding a touch of homeliness**\" explains the *effect* of the plates rather than just describing them.\n*   **Partial Adherence:** While the caption describes some visual elements, it does not provide the required detail on their \"**color, material, shape, and distinguishing features**\" as instructed. For example, it just says \"framed artwork\" instead of describing the different frames (one dark, one ornate gold).\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully captures the general essence of the scene but violates core negative constraints by including subjective language and interpretations. It also falls short in completeness by omitting key objects and the specific descriptive details (color, material) that the instructions mandate.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video depicts an indoor scene with a static, eye-level shot. The room features a light-colored, patterned wallpaper and framed artwork, including one with an ornate gold frame. Decorative blue and white plates are mounted on the wall. The lighting is warm, with a lamp featuring a cream-colored shade resting on dark wooden furniture at the bottom of the scene. The environment remains consistent throughout, with no significant changes in the setting or lighting, and the time of day is indeterminate due to the indoor lighting.",
