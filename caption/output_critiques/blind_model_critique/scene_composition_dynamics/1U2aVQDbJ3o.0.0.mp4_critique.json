    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a vast, snowy landscape in Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland. The setting is outdoors, featuring a sprawling expanse of snow-covered terrain interspersed with dense clusters of evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused light and the low position of the sun on the horizon. A notable visual element is a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue stripes, floating above the landscape. The balloon's material appears smooth and glossy. The scene transitions to an aerial view of a winding, snow-covered road, surrounded by trees, emphasizing the natural beauty and isolation of the area. Overlay elements include text indicating \"LEVI. Arctic Circle, Finland\" prominently displayed in the center, along with a disclaimer at the bottom about professional driving conditions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in terms of its structure and the elements it includes, but it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption appears to be accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies a plausible scene: a drone shot over a snowy landscape in Levi, Finland, featuring a hot air balloon, a winding road, and specific text overlays. The details provided, such as the balloon's colors and the content of the on-screen text, are specific and fact-based.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the required aspects mentioned in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** \"drone POV\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** \"outdoors,\" \"Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland,\" \"vast, snowy landscape,\" \"dense clusters of evergreen trees.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** \"early morning or late afternoon.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** \"hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue stripes.\"\n*   **Scene Transitions:** \"The scene transitions to an aerial view of a winding, snow-covered road.\"\n*   **Overlay Elements:** It correctly identifies the text and disclaimer as overlays and describes their content and placement.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has significant issues. It violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n**Violations:**\n\n1.  **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The instruction says, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   The caption states: \"The time of day **appears to be either** early morning **or** late afternoon...\" This uses both a speculative term (\"appears to be\") and an ambiguous option (\"either/or\").\n    *   It also says: \"The balloon's material **appears** smooth and glossy.\" This is another use of a forbidden speculative term.\n\n2.  **Do Not Explain Emphasis or Highlights:** The instruction says, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The caption begins with: \"The video... **showcases** a vast, snowy landscape...\" The word \"showcases\" implies intent and emphasis.\n    *   It later states: \"...**emphasizing** the natural beauty and isolation of the area.\" This is a direct violation of the rule.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption says, \"The setting is outdoors...\" after already establishing the scene is a \"vast, snowy landscape in Levi.\" This is slightly redundant and could be more concise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the caption is comprehensive and accurately describes the scene's components, it fails to follow the strict stylistic and content rules provided. The use of speculative language (\"appears to be\") and interpretive words (\"showcases,\" \"emphasizing\") directly contradicts the instructions. To be considered \"good\" according to the given rules, these violations would need to be corrected.",
