    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres closely to the instructions. It is accurate, concise, and descriptive.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key elements: the dimly lit stage, the raised platform with a red carpet, the two distinct background structures illuminated in blue, the white slatted wall with the number \"1733,\" and the textured wall of stacked circular objects. The description of the lighting is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene. It successfully covers the environment (stage), setting (indoors), and notable visual elements with their color, shape, and distinguishing features. It correctly omits details that are not present, such as subjects, motion, or overlays. The only minor omission is the point of view; adding that it is a \"static, eye-level shot\" would make it fully complete according to the instructions, but its absence does not detract from the quality of the description.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is written in simple, natural English and forms a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and refrains from inferring the purpose of the setting.\n    *   **Focus:** The focus remains on the setting and scenery, as requested.\n    *   **Negative Constraints:** The caption correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Adjectives:** The use of \"dramatic\" to describe the lighting is a borderline subjective adjective. However, in the context of visual description, it is a common and acceptable term for high-contrast lighting and effectively conveys the visual style without being overly emotional.\n    *   **\"Highlighting\":** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption uses the phrase \"spotlights highlighting the background elements.\" This is an acceptable use because it describes the literal function and effect of the lights as a visual fact within the scene, rather than interpreting the artistic intent or what the overall scene is trying to emphasize to the viewer.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by creating a description that is factual, detailed, and objective.",
