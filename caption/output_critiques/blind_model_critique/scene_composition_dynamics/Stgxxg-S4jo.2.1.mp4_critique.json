    "pre_caption": "The video takes place outdoors in a snowy landscape during daytime, with a group of people standing together on a thick blanket of snow. Several tall trees with branches heavily coated in white snow are positioned behind the group, their trunks and limbs forming intricate, frosted shapes. The background features a misty, pale sky and faint outlines of distant mountains, contributing to a cold, wintry atmosphere. The ground is uniformly covered in snow, with no visible paths or structures, and the overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted grays. The group is positioned near the center of the scene, and their winter clothing adds small accents of color against the otherwise monochromatic setting. No overlays or additional visual elements are present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it successfully follows some rules, it fails on several critical points.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description of the visual elements—the snowy landscape, trees, misty sky, mountains, and the color palette—is likely accurate for a video of such a scene. It correctly identifies the subjects as a group and describes their visual contribution (accents of color) without going into unnecessary detail. The statement about the absence of overlays is also a direct and accurate observation.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete and fails to provide a full picture of the video as required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the point of view (e.g., eye-level, drone shot, first-person). The caption omits this entirely, which is a significant failure. The POV is crucial for understanding how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n*   **Missing Motion:** The caption describes a completely static scene (\"a group of people standing together\"). Videos, by definition, contain motion. The instructions require a description of any movement, such as \"wind blowing through trees,\" \"snow falling,\" or \"pedestrians walking.\" By not mentioning any motion, the caption fails to describe the video as a dynamic sequence, treating it more like a still photograph.\n*   **Missing Scene Transitions:** If the video contains any cuts, pans, or other transitions, they are not mentioned. The instructions require a description of how the scene changes or shifts.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption adheres well to the negative constraints but fails to meet key positive requirements.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, concise paragraph.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"serene\").\n*   It avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"it appears\").\n*   It correctly describes the setting, time of day, and notable visual elements.\n*   It correctly notes the absence of overlays.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   **Failure to Include Mandatory Elements:** The primary failure is the omission of the **point of view** and any description of **motion or scene transitions**. These are not optional details but core requirements of the instructions.\n*   **Describing a Video as a Still Image:** By focusing only on static elements, the caption does not capture the essence of a video. It reads like a description of a photograph, which violates the spirit of the instructions.\n\nIn conclusion, the caption is **not good** because it is incomplete. It misses essential, explicitly requested information about the point of view and motion, which are fundamental to describing a video. While it follows many of the stylistic rules, its failure to provide a complete description makes it an unsuccessful execution of the prompt.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an eye-level view of a snowy landscape during daytime, featuring a group of people standing together on a thick blanket of snow. The scene is dynamic, with gentle snowflakes falling from the sky and a light breeze causing the branches of tall trees, heavily coated in white snow, to sway slightly. These trees, with their frosted trunks and limbs, form intricate shapes behind the group. The background reveals a misty, pale sky and faint outlines of distant mountains, enhancing the cold, wintry atmosphere. The ground is uniformly covered in snow, with no visible paths or structures, and the overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted grays. The group, positioned near the center of the scene, adds small accents of color with their winter clothing against the otherwise monochromatic setting. The video includes smooth transitions, panning slightly to reveal more of the surrounding landscape, emphasizing the serene yet dynamic nature of the environment. No overlays or additional visual elements are present.",
