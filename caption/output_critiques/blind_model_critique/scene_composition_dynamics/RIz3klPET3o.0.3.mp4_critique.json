    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the minimalist, side-view perspective and the core elements of the hand-drawn paths on a gray background. However, it lacks specificity and misses key details. The description of the point of view is redundant; stating it is a \"side-view gaming video\" is sufficient. Crucially, the caption fails to identify the 'P', rest symbol, and '10' in the upper left corner as HUD overlays, a specific requirement of the instructions. The description of motion is too basic, omitting the fact that the camera pans smoothly to follow the cyclist from left to right and that the bicycle's wheels are animated to show them spinning. The \"cartoonish figure\" is vaguely described; it is a simple black stick figure, but its small red helmet is a notable pop of color that is not mentioned. Furthermore, the caption completely overlooks key gameplay elements, such as the small, red, triangular spikes that appear intermittently on the lines as obstacles and the floating black musical notes the cyclist collects for points. Finally, the background is not a solid gray but has a faint, paper-like texture that enhances the overall hand-drawn aesthetic.",

Hand-drawn black lines form a series of curved, undulating paths. In the upper left corner, HUD overlays display a hand-drawn letter 'P', a rest symbol, and the number '10'. A simple black stick figure with a small red helmet rides a bicycle along these lines. The camera smoothly pans from left to right, following the cyclist, while the bicycle's wheels are animated to spin. The cyclist navigates around small, red, triangular spikes that appear as obstacles and collects floating black musical notes for points.",
