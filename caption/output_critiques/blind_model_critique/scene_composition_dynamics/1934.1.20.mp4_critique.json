    "pre_caption": "The video takes place in a stark, minimalist indoor setting with a monochromatic color scheme dominated by white. The environment is clinical and futuristic, featuring a group of individuals dressed in white, full-body suits with hoods, gathered around a small screen. One person stands out with a distinctive red top hat, adding a splash of color to the scene. The screen displays a small, white figure against a black background, drawing the group's attention. The setting is devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the screen and the individuals' interaction with it. The overall atmosphere is one of curiosity and observation, with the clean, uncluttered space enhancing the futuristic and sterile feel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the provided instructions, particularly those regarding subjectivity, interpretation, and focus.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe descriptive elements of the caption appear to be accurate based on the scene they construct. It correctly identifies the indoor setting, the monochromatic color scheme, the subjects' attire (white suits, red top hat), and the content on the screen.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several required details:\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the point of view (e.g., eye-level shot, high-angle shot), which is a required element.\n*   **Motion:** It describes a static scene. If there is any movement in the video (e.g., the figure on the screen moving, the people shifting), it is not mentioned.\n*   **Time of Day:** While it is an indoor scene, the time of day is not mentioned.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It violates multiple core rules:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses words like \"stark,\" \"minimalist,\" \"clinical,\" and \"futuristic.\" These are interpretive and subjective judgments about the scene's style and mood, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption states that the lack of props is \"...emphasizing the focus on the screen...\" and that the space is \"...enhancing the futuristic and sterile feel.\" This directly explains the intended effect and emphasis, which is against the rules.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** By describing the environment as \"clinical and futuristic,\" the caption infers a specific role or genre for the setting (e.g., a laboratory, a sci-fi scene) instead of just describing what is visually present.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"...drawing the group's attention\" is an inference about the subjects' mental state. A more compliant description would be \"a group of individuals are gathered around and facing a small screen.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" (Atmosphere):** The sentence \"The overall atmosphere is one of curiosity and observation...\" is a pure interpretation of the mood and the subjects' intent, which is strictly forbidden.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies some visual elements, it heavily relies on subjective interpretation, explains the scene's purpose, and infers mood and atmosphere, all of which are explicitly prohibited by the detailed instructions. It also misses key required information like the point of view.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is set in an indoor environment with a predominantly white color scheme. A group of individuals in white, full-body suits with hoods is gathered around a small screen. One person is wearing a red top hat. The screen shows a small, white figure on a black background. The setting lacks additional furniture or props. The camera captures the scene from an eye-level perspective. There is no visible movement from the individuals, and the time of day is not specified.",
