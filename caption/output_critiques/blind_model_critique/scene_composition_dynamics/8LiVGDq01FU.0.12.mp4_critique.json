    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it can be improved to better align with the specific and strict instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible scene based on its own text. It paints a clear picture of an astronaut in a dark, structured environment, which is consistent and logical.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view (e.g., eye-level, low-angle, static shot, handheld), which is a mandatory element according to the instructions. This is the most significant omission.\n*   **Missing Motion:** The caption describes a static scene. If there is any movement in the video (e.g., the camera panning, the astronaut moving, lights flickering), the caption is incomplete for not describing it.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a good overview of the scene's key elements in a single paragraph.\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It correctly identifies the setting as \"indoor\" and provides excellent detail on the \"tall, dark, vertically ribbed walls\" and their \"metallic appearance.\"\n*   **Subject Description:** The description of the astronaut is minimal and contextual, focusing on placement (\"foreground\") and appearance (\"white and grey helmet and suit\") without excessive detail, as instructed.\n*   **Avoids Inference:** It correctly avoids inferring the location's purpose (e.g., it doesn't call it a \"spaceship\" or \"hangar\").\n*   **Simple Language:** The language is clear, natural, and easy to understand.\n\n**Weaknesses (Where the caption deviates from instructions):**\n*   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...,\" which is redundant. The instructions imply a direct description of the scene itself.\n*   **Speculative Language:** The phrase \"somewhat metallic appearance\" violates the rule to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" \"Somewhat\" introduces uncertainty. A more definitive description like \"structures with a metallic finish\" would be better.\n*   **Explaining Emphasis:** The use of \"dominate\" and \"contrasting\" violates the instruction: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   \"dominate the background\" explains the visual weight of the structures.\n    *   \"contrasting with the surrounding shadows\" explains the visual relationship between the subject and the lighting, rather than just describing them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is clear, descriptive, and captures the main essence of the scene. However, it is not a *perfect* caption according to the very strict rules provided because it omits the point of view and uses minor speculative and interpretive language.\n\n### Revised Caption Example (Adhering to all instructions)\n\nHere is an example of how the caption could be rewritten to fully comply with the instructions, assuming a static, eye-level shot:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level perspective, the scene is an indoor setting with low-key lighting. The background contains tall, dark, vertically ribbed structures with a metallic finish. In the foreground, an astronaut wearing a white and grey helmet and suit is partially lit against the surrounding shadows.",
