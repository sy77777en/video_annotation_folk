    "pre_caption": "The video presents a third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height, set in a narrow urban alleyway. The environment is outdoors, with tall buildings on either side, creating a confined space. The alley is lined with textured brick walls, one side featuring graffiti and signs of wear, while the other has a more uniform, tiled appearance. The ground is concrete, with scattered debris and puddles suggesting recent rain. Overhead, fire escapes and utility lines add to the urban atmosphere. The time of day appears to be overcast, with diffused light casting soft shadows. The scene transitions smoothly as the character walks through the alley, moving towards a brighter street visible at the end, where more modern buildings and a stop sign can be seen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot showing a character from waist height**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I've just watched.\n\nWhile the caption accurately captures the general atmosphere and movement, it misses several key visual details and contains some imprecise terminology. The description of the point of view as a \"third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot\" is contradictory; it is simply an over-the-shoulder shot, as \"POV\" implies a first-person perspective. The caption fails to mention the prominent, faded graffiti mural of a blue whale on the worn brick wall, a significant visual element that contrasts with the otherwise grimy setting. The \"tiled appearance\" on the opposing wall is more specifically a wall of small, white hexagonal tiles, some of which are cracked and missing. Furthermore, the description of motion is slightly misleading; it is not a \"scene transition\" but a continuous tracking shot that follows the character, and the camera has a subtle, handheld shake that adds to the gritty realism. The caption also omits the semi-transparent text overlay in the lower-left corner that reads \"District 7, 14:32,\" providing specific location and time context. Finally, while a bus is mentioned, its distinct bright yellow color, which provides a striking flash of color against the muted tones of the alley, is a noteworthy detail that was left out.",
