    "pre_caption": "A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art golf course. The scene features a green fairway and a putting green with a red flag in the hole, surrounded by trees and a sand trap. A body of water is visible on the left, and a dirt path runs along the bottom. A pixelated golfer on the green swings their club, sending the ball into the hole. The scene includes numerous overlay elements. In the top left corner, text indicates \"2ND\", \"PAR 4 363.3Y\", and the player's score \"E 3RD\". In the top center, a distance marker to the pin is displayed. In the top right, a wind indicator shows \"3Y\". On the left, a \"NORMAL\" power bar and a club selection labeled \"RUTTER PUDDLE WEDGE\" are visible. At the bottom, a power meter shows \"16Y\", and on the right, a golf ball icon is labeled \"FAIRWAY 0Y RANGE\". After the ball goes in the hole, the words \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" appear in large, colorful text in the center of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general pixel-art aesthetic and the key overlay elements, but it lacks dynamism and specificity regarding the on-screen action and environment. The description of the golfer swinging and the ball landing in the hole feels static; in the video, the camera likely pans and zooms to follow the ball's high, pixelated arc as it flies through the air before landing and rolling across the checkered-patterned putting green. The caption misses the subtle animations, such as the flag fluttering in the wind, the pixelated shimmer on the surface of the water, or the way the other HUD elements fade out or disappear when the celebratory \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" text animates onto the screen with a flashing, multi-colored effect. Furthermore, the description of the overlays could be more functional; the \"power meter\" at the bottom is not just a static number but an animated bar that fills with color as the player holds a button to determine shot strength. Lastly, the club selection is listed as \"RUTTER PUDDLE WEDGE,\" which seems to be a typo in the caption, as the video clearly shows the standard club name \"PUTTER\" selected for a shot on the green.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a vibrant pixel-art golf course from a dynamic top-down perspective. The scene is alive with movement: the camera smoothly pans and zooms to follow the pixelated golfer's swing, capturing the ball's high arc as it soars through the air and lands, rolling across the checkered-patterned putting green. The environment is rich with detail, from the fluttering red flag marking the hole to the shimmering surface of the nearby water. As the golfer prepares their shot, the animated power meter at the bottom fills with color, reflecting the player's control over shot strength. The club selection on the left correctly displays \"PUTTER,\" suitable for the green. Overlay elements enhance the experience: in the top left, \"2ND,\" \"PAR 4 363.3Y,\" and the player's score \"E 3RD\" are shown; the top center features a distance marker to the pin; the top right displays a wind indicator reading \"3Y.\" As the ball drops into the hole, the HUD elements fade, and the screen bursts with the celebratory \"CHIP IN BIRDIE\" text, animated in a flashing, multi-colored display, capturing the excitement of the moment.",
