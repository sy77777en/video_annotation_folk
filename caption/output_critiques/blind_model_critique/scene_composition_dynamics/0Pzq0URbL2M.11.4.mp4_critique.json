    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, minimalist environment. A long, dark table extends across the scene, surrounded by a row of identical chairs. Seated at the table are multiple figures, all wearing similar attire, facing away from the viewer. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows and creating a reflective surface on the floor, enhancing the room's sleek and modern aesthetic. The atmosphere is calm and still, with no visible movement or activity. Overlays include a small text element in the bottom left corner, which is not part of the scene itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\nThe caption is good overall, but it has some minor inaccuracies and misses key details required by the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is largely accurate in its description of the scene's core elements: an indoor, dimly lit, minimalist setting with a long table, chairs, and figures facing away.\n*   The description of the lighting as casting \"soft shadows\" is partially inaccurate. While there are soft shadows, the lighting also creates strong, focused highlights on the table's surface, which is a prominent visual feature.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption fails to describe the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot. The instructions specifically ask to indicate the POV.\n*   **Missing Overlay Content:** The caption mentions \"a small text element\" but does not describe its content (\"SHUTTERSTOCK\"), which is a direct requirement of the instruction to \"describe their content and placement.\"\n*   **Incomplete Description of Materials:** The caption notes the floor is reflective but omits that the **table** itself is the most prominent reflective surface in the scene. Its highly polished, dark surface is a central feature.\n\n**Adherence to Instruction:**\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption successfully follows several key rules. It avoids referring to specific frames, using terms like \"image,\" inferring the room's purpose (e.g., \"conference room\"), and using speculative language. It correctly identifies the overlay as \"not part of the scene itself.\"\n*   **Minor Violation:** The phrase \"enhancing the room's sleek and modern aesthetic\" slightly violates the rule \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" It describes the *effect* of the lighting rather than just the lighting itself. A more compliant description would be \"The room has a sleek and modern style.\"\n*   **Failure to Adhere:** The caption fails to adhere to the instruction to describe the **content** of the overlay, which is a significant omission.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more closely follows all instructions:\n\nFrom a static, eye-level point of view, the video shows a dimly lit, minimalist indoor room. A long, dark, and highly reflective table stretches horizontally, with a row of identical dark chairs arranged along its far side. Several figures in similar dark attire are seated in the chairs, facing away from the camera. The focused overhead lighting creates strong highlights on the table and casts shadows in the surrounding space, while the dark floor also has a reflective quality. The scene is completely still, with no movement. A \"SHUTTERSTOCK\" text overlay is present in the bottom left corner.",
