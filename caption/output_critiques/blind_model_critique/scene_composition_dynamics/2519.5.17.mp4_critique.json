    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder point of view, focusing on a dimly lit room. The environment is warm and intimate, with soft lighting casting gentle shadows. The walls are a neutral color, and a framed picture is visible in the background, adding a personal touch to the space. The scene captures two individuals, with the camera positioned behind one, showing their upper body and the interaction with the other person. The lighting and close proximity suggest a private and possibly significant moment between the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several key negative constraints, particularly regarding subjectivity, speculation, and interpretation.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption describes a plausible scene, and the elements mentioned (over-the-shoulder POV, dim lighting, two people) are consistent with each other. However, its accuracy is undermined by the use of interpretive and emotional language rather than objective visual facts.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in several areas:\n*   **Time of Day:** It fails to mention the time of day (e.g., night, or unclear due to indoor lighting).\n*   **Object Details:** The description of the \"framed picture\" is too vague. The instructions require details like color, material, and shape for notable elements, but the caption only notes its existence.\n*   **Motion:** The caption does not describe any motion or lack thereof. It is unclear if the subjects are still or moving (e.g., talking, gesturing).\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention the presence or absence of any overlay elements like text or watermarks.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly. It violates multiple explicit rules:\n\n*   **VIOLATION: Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.**\n    *   The caption uses \"warm and intimate\" to describe the environment and \"gentle\" to describe the shadows. These are subjective interpretations of the mood, not objective descriptions of the visual information.\n*   **VIOLATION: Avoid speculative statements.**\n    *   The final sentence, \"The lighting and close proximity suggest a private and possibly significant moment between the subjects,\" is entirely speculative. The words \"suggest\" and \"possibly\" are clear indicators of speculation, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **VIOLATION: Do not infer the role of the scene setting or explain what the scene emphasizes.**\n    *   The phrase \"adding a personal touch to the space\" infers the purpose and effect of the framed picture, which is a direct violation of the instructions.\n    *   The final sentence about a \"private and possibly significant moment\" is a clear attempt to explain what the scene emphasizes, which is also forbidden.\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions for the same hypothetical scene:\n\nFrom an over-the-shoulder point of view, the scene is set within a dimly lit indoor room at night. An unseen light source casts soft-edged shadows across the space. The walls are a neutral color, and a rectangular, dark-colored frame containing a picture is mounted on a wall in the background. The camera is positioned behind one person, capturing their upper back and head as they face a second individual standing in close proximity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor scene from an over-the-shoulder perspective in a dimly lit room at night. Soft-edged shadows are cast by an unseen light source. The walls are neutral in color, and a rectangular, dark-colored frame with a picture is visible on the wall in the background. The camera captures the upper back and head of one person as they face another individual standing nearby. There is no visible motion or overlay elements like text or watermarks.",
