    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans to the right along a wooden boardwalk at an outdoor animal park during the day. The boardwalk has a brown wooden top rail and metal and glass safety barriers, overlooking a large enclosure with a dirt ground, a moat-like body of water, and gray rock formations. A one-story, tan-colored building with a flat roof stands at the back of the enclosure, where an elephant is partially visible. In the distance, beyond the park's lush green trees, a light blue elevated track and a tall, dark tower are visible against an overcast sky as other visitors walk along the path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general scene and camera movement, but it could be more specific to better reflect the visual experience. The description of the elephant as \"partially visible\" is an understatement; the camera's pan to the right actively follows the elephant as it walks across the enclosure, making it the clear subject of the shot. The background elements are too generically described; the \"light blue elevated track\" is a monorail system, and a white and blue train car is seen moving along it, while the \"tall, dark tower\" is a recognizable drop-tower amusement park ride, suggesting the location is a larger entertainment complex. The description of the first-person motion as \"trucking and panning\" is technically correct but misses the subtle, natural bobbing motion of someone walking, which is evident throughout. Furthermore, the caption omits finer details that add realism, such as the visible smudges and handprints on the glass safety barriers and the fact that the enclosure ground is a mix of dry, cracked dirt and patches of worn grass, not just \"dirt.\" Finally, the presence of other visitors could be described more effectively to enhance the first-person feel, as the arms and shoulders of people standing at the railing next to the camera periodically enter the edges of the view.",
