    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, rustic atmosphere. The environment features a cluttered workspace with various tools and materials, suggesting a workshop or craft area. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting gentle shadows that enhance the cozy feel of the space. Notable visual elements include a wooden table with a textured surface, scattered with small objects and containers. The walls are adorned with hanging items, adding to the sense of a busy, lived-in space. The color palette consists of earthy tones, with browns and greens dominating the scene. The presence of figures engaged in activity adds a dynamic element, contributing to the overall impression of a bustling, creative environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully captures the general mood of the scene but falls short on several key instructions. It relies heavily on subjective and emotional adjectives like \"warm,\" \"rustic,\" \"cozy,\" and \"bustling,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions of the visual elements. The description of objects is too generic; phrases like \"various tools and materials\" and \"small objects and containers\" lack the required specificity. For example, if the video shows a potter, the caption should mention \"pottery tools,\" \"wet clay,\" and \"bowls of water\" instead. The caption also omits the mandatory point of view and fails to describe the specific motion, such as \"a pair of hands shaping clay on a spinning pottery wheel,\" opting for the interpretive phrase \"adds a dynamic element.\" Furthermore, it makes speculative statements like \"suggesting a workshop\" and explains the effect of the lighting (\"enhance the cozy feel\"), which violates the rule against inference and interpretation. To improve, the caption should state the POV, describe the specific objects and their materials (e.g., \"shelves against a brick wall holding green-glazed pots\"), detail the central action without interpretation, and remove all subjective language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is shot from a first-person point of view, focusing on a cluttered workspace that resembles a workshop or craft area. The scene includes a wooden table with a textured surface, covered with specific items such as pottery tools, wet clay, and bowls of water. Shelves against a brick wall hold green-glazed pots, and various tools hang from the walls. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting shadows across the workspace. A pair of hands is seen shaping clay on a spinning pottery wheel, providing a clear depiction of the central activity. The color palette features earthy tones, primarily browns and greens, without any interpretive commentary on the atmosphere.",
