    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, rustic atmosphere. The environment features a cluttered workspace with various tools and materials, suggesting a workshop or craft area. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting gentle shadows that enhance the cozy feel of the space. Notable visual elements include a wooden table with a textured surface, scattered with small objects and containers. The walls are adorned with hanging items, adding to the sense of a busy, lived-in space. The color palette consists of earthy tones, with browns and greens dominating the scene. The presence of figures engaged in activity adds a dynamic element, contributing to the overall impression of a bustling, creative environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nIt fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints, particularly regarding objectivity and inference.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**Failures:**\n\n*   **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates this rule repeatedly.\n    *   **\"warm, rustic atmosphere\"**: \"Warm\" and \"rustic\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood.\n    *   **\"cozy feel\"**: \"Cozy\" is an emotional adjective.\n    *   **\"gentle shadows\"**: \"Gentle\" is a subjective descriptor.\n    *   **\"bustling, creative environment\"**: \"Bustling\" and \"creative\" are highly interpretive and subjective.\n\n*   **Inferring the Role of the Scene Setting:** The instructions explicitly state, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   **\"suggesting a workshop or craft area\"**: This is a direct inference. The caption should describe the elements (tools, materials) without concluding what the space is used for.\n\n*   **Explaining What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** The instructions forbid explaining the effect of visual elements.\n    *   **\"enhance the cozy feel of the space\"**: This explains the *purpose* of the shadows, which is a violation.\n    *   **\"adding to the sense of a busy, lived-in space\"**: This explains the *effect* of the hanging items.\n    *   **\"adds a dynamic element\"**: This explains the *function* of the figures' presence.\n    *   **\"contributing to the overall impression of...\"**: This is another example of explaining the effect of an element on the viewer's perception.\n\n**Successes:**\n\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Describes Overall Scene:** It correctly identifies the setting as an indoor, cluttered workspace.\n*   **Describes Visual Elements:** It mentions the wooden table, its texture, and the earthy color palette (browns and greens), which aligns with the instruction to describe color and material.\n*   **Subject Placement:** It mentions \"figures engaged in activity\" without excessive detail, which is appropriate.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and misses several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** It fails to mention the POV (e.g., static shot, first-person, handheld), which is a mandatory element.\n*   **Motion:** While it mentions \"activity,\" it does not describe the actual motion. For example, it doesn't specify if the camera is moving or what kind of movement the figures are making.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention if there are any overlays (text, watermarks, etc.), which is a specific requirement.\n*   **Specifics of Objects:** The description of objects is vague (\"small objects and containers,\" \"hanging items\"). While avoiding excessive detail is key, it could be slightly more descriptive (e.g., \"glass jars,\" \"metal tools\") without being overly specific.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption appears to be factually accurate in its description of the scene's contents (a workspace with a table, tools, and figures). The primary issue is not *what* it describes but *how* it describes it, using forbidden subjective and inferential language.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a fixed viewpoint, this indoor scene shows a cluttered workspace. A wooden table with a textured surface is centered, holding various small objects and containers. On the surrounding walls, several items are hung. The lighting is soft and originates from an overhead source, casting shadows across the room. The scene is composed primarily of brown and green tones. A person is present at the table, engaged in an unspecified activity with their hands.",
