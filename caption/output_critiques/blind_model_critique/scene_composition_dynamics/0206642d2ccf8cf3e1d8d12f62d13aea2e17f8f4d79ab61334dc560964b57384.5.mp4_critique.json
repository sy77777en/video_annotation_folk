    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor kitchen setting with a wooden cutting board placed on a light-colored countertop. The board is covered with sliced cucumbers, showcasing their green, textured skin and pale interior. A knife with a white handle rests beside the cucumbers. In the foreground, fresh vegetables, including vibrant red tomatoes, crisp green lettuce, and a white bulb onion with green stalks, are arranged. The environment is well-lit, highlighting the natural colors and textures of the produce, creating a clean and organized culinary workspace.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas for improvement to fully align with the detailed instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the objects (cutting board, cucumbers, knife, tomatoes, lettuce, onion), their state (sliced), their colors (green, pale, white, red), materials (wooden), and textures (textured skin).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing key details required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the point of view (e.g., a close-up shot, a top-down view, a static shot), which is a specific requirement.\n*   **Motion:** It does not describe any motion or lack thereof. If the video is a static shot, this should be stated. If a hand is slicing or moving objects, that motion should be described.\n*   **Time of Day:** While less critical for a well-lit indoor scene, the instruction to mention the time of day was not addressed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows many rules well but violates a few important ones.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and speculative language like \"it appears.\"\n*   It successfully combines details into a coherent description of the overall scene.\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than a human subject.\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n\n**Where the caption deviates from the instructions:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"vibrant,\" \"crisp,\" \"clean,\" and \"organized.\" While \"vibrant\" and \"crisp\" can describe the physical state of produce, \"clean\" and \"organized\" are subjective judgments about the environment, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   **Inference:** It describes the setting as a \"culinary workspace.\" This infers the role of the scene, which the instructions state to avoid (\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\").\n*   **Missing Elements:** As noted under \"Completeness,\" it omits the required descriptions of the point of view and motion.\n\n### Revised Example Caption\nHere is an example of a revised caption that more strictly adheres to all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a close-up, static perspective, the video shows an indoor kitchen setting. A wooden cutting board sits on a light-colored countertop, covered with sliced cucumbers that have green, textured skin and a pale interior. A knife with a white handle rests beside the cucumbers. In the foreground, red tomatoes, green lettuce, and a white bulb onion with green stalks are arranged. The scene is brightly lit, showing the natural colors of the vegetables.",
