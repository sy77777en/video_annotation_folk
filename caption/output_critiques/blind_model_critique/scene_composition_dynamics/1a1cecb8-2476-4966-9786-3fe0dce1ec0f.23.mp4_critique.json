    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor urban intersection during the day, featuring a crosswalk and traffic lights. The setting includes a mix of natural and architectural elements, with trees lining the street and buildings in the background. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene. Vehicles, including a car, are visible on the road, indicating light traffic. The environment is clean and organized, with clear road markings and pedestrian pathways. The scene maintains a neutral color palette, with the gray of the pavement contrasting against the greenery of the trees and the brick and concrete of the buildings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on an imagined video that aligns with the caption's description.\n\nThe caption omits the point of view, which appears to be a fixed, elevated shot from a corner building, providing a clear, observational perspective of the entire intersection. It fails to describe the specific motion within the scene; for instance, it doesn't mention that the vehicles stop and proceed in accordance with the changing red, yellow, and green traffic lights, or that the pedestrians are actively crossing within the white-striped crosswalk. The description of the environment as \"clean and organized\" is a subjective assessment, whereas the instructions require objective details. Furthermore, the caption misses a key visual element: a hard cut transition to a closer shot focusing on the pedestrian walk signal as it changes, before cutting back to the wider view. It also fails to mention the presence of a semi-transparent watermark for a stock footage company in the bottom-right corner, which is a required detail for overlay elements. While it mentions buildings, it could more precisely describe them as a mix of multi-story red-brick and modern concrete structures to provide better context without being overly detailed.",
