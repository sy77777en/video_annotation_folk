    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room with a serious atmosphere, likely a control or command center. The environment features dark walls and subdued lighting, creating a focused and intense setting. Several individuals in military uniforms are present, with one prominently positioned in the foreground. The uniforms are dark blue with various colorful insignias and medals, indicating rank and achievements. The background includes blurred screens emitting a soft glow, suggesting the presence of technology and monitoring equipment.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several core negative constraints, particularly regarding subjectivity, speculation, and inference.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video does show what is described (a dimly lit room with people in uniform), the caption is factually accurate in its basic description. It correctly identifies the setting as indoors, the lighting as dim, and the presence of individuals in uniforms with medals.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it misses several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the point of view (e.g., eye-level, high-angle, static shot, handheld).\n*   **Motion or Changes:** It describes a static scene. If there is any movement in the video (e.g., people moving, screens flickering, camera panning), it is not mentioned.\n*   **Time of Day:** While it is indoors, no attempt is made to establish a time of day, which could be suggested by elements like windows or the context of the scene.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention if there are any overlay elements like text or watermarks.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It violates multiple explicit negative constraints.\n\n**1. Violation: Use of Subjective and Emotional Language**\nThe instructions state: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Caption:** \"...with a **serious atmosphere**...\"\n*   **Caption:** \"...creating a **focused and intense** setting.\"\n*   **Caption:** \"The overall ambiance is **formal and professional**, with a **sense of authority and purpose**.\"\nThese phrases describe feelings and interpretations rather than objective visual facts.\n\n**2. Violation: Inclusion of Speculation and Inference**\nThe instructions state: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B',\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n*   **Caption:** \"...**likely a control or command center**.\" This is a direct inference about the room's function. The caption should only describe what is seen (e.g., \"a room with screens\").\n*   **Caption:** \"...**suggesting the presence of technology and monitoring equipment**.\" The word \"suggesting\" is speculative. The caption should simply state that there are glowing screens.\n*   **Caption:** \"...**indicating rank and achievements**.\" This infers the purpose of the medals and insignias, rather than just describing their appearance.\n\n**3. Violation: Explaining Emphasis**\nThe instructions state: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Caption:** \"...with one **prominently positioned** in the foreground.\" The word \"prominently\" is a subtle way of explaining emphasis, guiding the viewer's focus. A more neutral description would be \"One individual is in the foreground.\"\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption\n\nTo demonstrate adherence to the instructions, here is a revised version of the caption that follows all the rules:\n\nFrom an eye-level point of view, the scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room that has dark walls. Several individuals are present, wearing dark blue uniforms adorned with colorful insignias and medals. One of these individuals is positioned in the foreground, while in the background, several blurred screens emit a soft glow.",
