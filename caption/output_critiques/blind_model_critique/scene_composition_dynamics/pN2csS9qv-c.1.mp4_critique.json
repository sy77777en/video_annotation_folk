    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a gymnasium, featuring a gymnastics event. The setting includes gymnastic equipment like uneven bars, with a blue mat covering the floor. The environment is lively, with participants wearing red leotards adorned with sparkles, indicating a competitive or celebratory atmosphere. The gymnasium has high ceilings and visible seating areas, suggesting a space designed for sports events. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor sports venues, and the overall scene conveys a sense of activity and movement, with individuals interacting energetically around the equipment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt at describing the scene but **fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints and omits key required information**. While it correctly identifies the setting and some visual elements, it includes subjective language, speculation, and inferences that were explicitly forbidden.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Plausible:** The description of a gymnasium with uneven bars, a blue mat, and participants in red leotards is factually plausible for a gymnastics event. Assuming the video shows this, the core details are accurate.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (What's Missing)\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits several elements required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** This is a mandatory element. The caption does not state if the video is from a static camera, a handheld shot, a drone, etc. This is a major omission.\n*   **Overlays:** The instructions require mentioning overlays (text, watermarks, icons). The caption does not state whether they are present or absent.\n*   **Motion/Transitions:** While it mentions \"activity and movement,\" it does so in a vague, interpretive way. It fails to describe specific motions (e.g., \"a person performs a routine on the bars,\" \"people walk across the mat\") or any scene transitions (like cuts or pans).\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions (Where it Fails)\n\nThis is the area with the most significant issues. The caption violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n*   **FAIL: Avoids Emotional or Subjective Adjectives.**\n    *   The caption uses the word **\"lively\"** to describe the environment. This is a subjective interpretation of the atmosphere.\n    *   It describes the individuals as interacting **\"energetically,\"** which is another subjective assessment of their behavior.\n\n*   **FAIL: Avoids Speculative Statements and Inferences.**\n    *   The caption states the red leotards are **\"indicating a competitive or celebratory atmosphere.\"** This is a direct inference about the event's nature, which is forbidden.\n    *   It says the seating areas are **\"suggesting a space designed for sports events.\"** This is a speculative conclusion about the gymnasium's purpose, violating the rule \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   It describes the lighting as **\"typical of indoor sports venues,\"** which is an assumption and not a direct observation.\n\n*   **FAIL: Does Not Explain What the Scene Emphasizes.**\n    *   The final phrase, **\"the overall scene conveys a sense of activity and movement,\"** is a direct violation of this rule. It explains the feeling or emphasis of the scene rather than simply describing the visible facts.\n\n### Corrected Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions, assuming a static wide shot:\n\nFrom a static, wide-angle point of view, the scene is set indoors in a brightly lit gymnasium with high ceilings and rows of spectator seating. The floor is covered with a large blue mat, on which gymnastics equipment, including a set of uneven bars, is positioned. Several people wearing red leotards with sparkling details are present on the mat. There are no text or graphic overlays.",
