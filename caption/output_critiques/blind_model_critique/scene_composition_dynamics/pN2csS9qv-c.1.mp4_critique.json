    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a gymnasium, featuring a gymnastics event. The setting includes gymnastic equipment like uneven bars, with a blue mat covering the floor. The environment is lively, with participants wearing red leotards adorned with sparkles, indicating a competitive or celebratory atmosphere. The gymnasium has high ceilings and visible seating areas, suggesting a space designed for sports events. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor sports venues, and the overall scene conveys a sense of activity and movement, with individuals interacting energetically around the equipment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the indoor gymnasium setting and the gymnastics event, it lacks crucial specificity and includes prohibited subjective analysis. The description of the floor as being covered by \"a blue mat\" is inaccurate; the scene shows a large, blue, spring-loaded floor exercise area, with the uneven bars positioned on a separate platform with its own distinct landing mat. The caption fails to mention the point of view, which is a stable wide shot from the stands, and completely omits the persistent on-screen overlays, including a score bug in the top-left corner with the athlete's details and a network watermark in the bottom-right. Furthermore, it uses interpretive language like \"lively\" and makes speculative statements such as \"indicating a competitive or celebratory atmosphere,\" which should be avoided. To improve, the caption should describe the specific motion of the main gymnast performing a routine on the bars, mention other visible equipment like the balance beam in the background, and include objective details of the environment, such as the digital scoreboards on the walls, judges at their tables, and other teams in different colored leotards, providing a more complete and factual account of the scene.",
