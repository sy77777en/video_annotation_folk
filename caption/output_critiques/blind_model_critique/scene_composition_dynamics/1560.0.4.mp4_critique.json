    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially successful but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the visual content: a plain black background with a centered text overlay.\n*   **Accurate:** It accurately transcribes the text on the overlay (\"FREE EPISODE FROM MY HYPERLAPSE COURSE\" and \"EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING\") and correctly identifies their respective colors (red and white).\n*   **Accurate:** It correctly notes the absence of other environmental or visual details.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption fails to specify the **point of view** (e.g., a \"fixed shot\" or \"static view\").\n*   **Incomplete:** It does not mention **motion**. It is unclear if the video is a static shot or if the text animates. The instructions require describing motion or changes if they occur. If the scene is static, this should be stated.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation:** The instruction states, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption violates this rule twice:\n    1.  \"...maintaining a **focus on** the text overlay.\"\n    2.  \"...**emphasizing** clarity and directness.\"\n    These phrases explain the intended effect or purpose of the visual design, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation:** The instruction says to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses several subjective style descriptors:\n    *   \"prominent\"\n    *   \"minimalistic\"\n    *   \"straightforward\"\n    *   \"modern\"\n    While some style descriptors are acceptable, these lean toward interpretation rather than objective description. For example, instead of \"prominent,\" one could simply describe the text as \"bold\" and \"large.\"\n\n*   **Violation:** The instruction states, \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The phrase \"maintaining a focus on the text overlay\" infers the purpose of the minimalistic setting.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is good at accurately describing the core visual elements (text, color, background). However, it fails by including subjective analysis and explaining the purpose of the design, both of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. It is also incomplete because it omits any mention of the point of view or motion (or lack thereof).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video displays a plain black background with a centered text overlay. The text reads \"FREE EPISODE FROM MY HYPERLAPSE COURSE\" in bold red and \"EQUIPMENT & SHOOTING\" in bold white. The shot is static, with no motion or additional visual elements.",
