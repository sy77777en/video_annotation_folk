    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dimly lit, dark indoor environment. On a reddish-brown surface, a small, dark, roughly cuboid object with metallic-looking components rests. A figure, rendered in a desaturated, almost grayscale palette, emerges from the shadows. The figure is dressed in a dark suit and a lighter-colored collared shirt, with light-colored hair and round glasses. They stand with their arms crossed. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"T REHM\" and \"PHILOLOGIST\" on a light beige, card-like background with a circular design element. The overall atmosphere is somber and shadowy.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good and adheres closely to the instructions, but with one minor deviation.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly describes the dimly lit indoor setting, the reddish-brown surface, and the small, dark object with metallic components. The description of the figure is also precise, noting their desaturated color palette, clothing, light-colored hair, and round glasses. The description of the motion—emerging from the shadows and crossing their arms—is also correct. The details of the overlay, including the text \"T REHM\" and \"PHILOLOGIST,\" its placement, and the card-like background, are all perfectly accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It covers all the essential visual information: the environment, a key prop, the subject, the subject's action, and the overlay. It successfully combines details from the entire video into a single, coherent description of the scene as it unfolds.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the vast majority of the instructions exceptionally well:\n*   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n*   It correctly identifies the setting as indoors and describes its key features.\n*   It describes the color, shape, and material of notable elements.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes the overlay content and placement.\n*   It describes the motion within the scene.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image,\" speculative language, and references to specific frames.\n*   It maintains a descriptive, neutral tone for most of the description.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\nThe only minor deviation from the instructions is the use of a subjective adjective. The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The last sentence, \"The overall atmosphere is somber and shadowy,\" uses the word \"somber,\" which describes a mood and is subjective. While \"shadowy\" is a good descriptive adjective, \"somber\" is an interpretation of the scene's emotional tone. To be in perfect compliance, this word should be omitted.",
