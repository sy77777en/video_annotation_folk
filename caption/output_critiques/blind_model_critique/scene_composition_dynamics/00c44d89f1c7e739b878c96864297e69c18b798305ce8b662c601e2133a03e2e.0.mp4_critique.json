    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor scene during sunset, featuring a serene landscape with a prominent tree in the foreground. The setting is a grassy field with a few scattered trees in the distance. The sky is painted with warm hues as the sun sets on the horizon, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the sun's rays filtering through the tree branches, creating a picturesque view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and detail.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Cannot be determined:** Without access to the video, it is impossible to verify if the described scene (outdoor sunset, prominent tree, grassy field) is accurate. The feedback below assumes the visual content matches the caption's basic description.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., eye-level shot, low-angle shot, static shot), which is a required element that helps describe how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n*   **Lacks Specific Detail:** The instructions require describing notable visual elements with details like color, material, shape, and texture. The caption mentions a \"prominent tree\" but offers no specific description of its type, the color of its leaves or bark, or its shape, making the description too generic.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\n*   **Use of Subjective/Emotional Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words like \"serene,\" \"gentle,\" \"calm,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"picturesque.\" These words describe feelings about the scene rather than objective facts.\n*   **Inference and Interpretation:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption includes the phrase \"emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape,\" which is an interpretation of the scene's purpose and effect, directly contradicting the rule.\n*   **Vague Language:** Phrases like \"painted with warm hues\" and \"creating a picturesque view\" are stylistic and interpretive rather than the simple, direct, and objective language requested. A better description would be \"The sky is orange and pink near the horizon.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an outdoor scene during sunset, captured from an eye-level perspective. In the foreground, there is a large oak tree with rough, brown bark and green leaves. The setting is a grassy field with a few scattered trees in the distance. The sky is orange and pink near the horizon as the sun sets, casting light through the tree branches. The scene is static, with no visible movement, highlighting the natural elements present.",
