    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates a dark interior of a house, viewed through a monochromatic green night-vision filter. The perspective moves from behind a white, paneled door into a hallway, passing a light switch on the wall. In the background, a doorway opens into another room where a figure in tactical gear is visible near a small table, a chair, and a potted plant. The scene features several on-screen overlay elements, including a \"Checkpoint\" notification in the top-left corner, green subtitles at the bottom, and a heads-up display in the lower-right showing an ammunition count.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very closely to the provided instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly plausible and internally consistent. It accurately portrays a scene that is common in first-person video games or found-footage style films.\n*   Details like the \"monochromatic green night-vision filter,\" \"white, paneled door,\" and the specific content and placement of the overlay elements (\"Checkpoint\" in top-left, subtitles at bottom, HUD in lower-right) are precise and contribute to a clear mental picture.\n*   The description of the subject (\"figure in tactical gear\") is contextual and avoids excessive detail, as instructed.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the key requirements:\n    *   **Point of View:** Clearly identified as \"A first-person POV shot.\"\n    *   **Environment/Setting:** \"dark interior of a house,\" moving into a \"hallway\" and looking into \"another room.\"\n    *   **Time of Day:** Implied effectively through \"dark interior\" and the \"night-vision filter.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** Describes the door, light switch, table, chair, and plant.\n    *   **Overlays:** Correctly identifies and describes the HUD, notification, and subtitles as overlays.\n    *   **Motion:** The use of verbs like \"navigates\" and \"moves from... into...\" effectively describes the continuous motion of the perspective.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Formatting and Language:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It correctly avoids Markdown and introductory text.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and speculative language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Focus:** The focus remains on the setting and scenery, with the subject's description kept minimal and contextual, perfectly matching the instruction.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, sticking to factual descriptions (e.g., \"white, paneled door\" instead of \"creepy old door\").\n*   **Conciseness:** The phrase \"as if through the character’s eyes\" is slightly redundant after \"first-person POV shot,\" but it serves to clarify the perspective and is a minor stylistic point. Otherwise, the caption is very concise.\n*   **Combining Details:** The description of movement (\"navigates a dark interior... moves from behind a... door into a hallway\") demonstrates a successful synthesis of information over a duration, rather than describing a static scene.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is descriptive without being speculative, detailed without being cluttered, and objective without being dry. It successfully balances the need for information with the constraints on length and style.",
