    "pre_caption": "A third-person 3D game video, where the entire character is visible on screen, takes place in a dimly lit room with dark, plain walls and a wooden plank floor. A thick, dark pipe runs along the top of the back wall. To the left is a wooden chest of drawers with some drawers open, and several toy blocks are scattered on the floor in front of it. In the center of the room, a small figure in a yellow raincoat holding a light stands on the raised end of a wooden seesaw. To the right, a simple wooden swing hangs from the ceiling. The only significant illumination comes from the character's light, casting a small glow and leaving the rest of the room in deep shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly establishes the third-person game perspective and the main components of the scene, but it describes a static snapshot rather than a moving video. It misses the subtle but important motion, such as the gentle, rhythmic swaying of the wooden swing on the right and the constant flickering of the flame from the small, brass-colored lantern the character holds, which makes the shadows in the room dance. The description of the walls as 'plain' is also a simplification; the video clearly shows large, dark water stains and areas of peeling paint over a grimy, concrete-like texture. Additionally, the caption completely omits the game's user interface, specifically a white, circular interaction icon that pulses over the lower end of the seesaw. Lastly, the camera is not stationary but performs a slow dolly-in, gradually moving closer to the character on the seesaw, which is a key part of how the scene is presented to the viewer.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this third-person 3D game video, the entire character is visible on screen, set in a dimly lit room with dark walls that feature large water stains and peeling paint over a grimy, concrete-like texture.
