    "pre_caption": "A third-person 3D game video, where the entire character is visible on screen, takes place in a dimly lit room with dark, plain walls and a wooden plank floor. A thick, dark pipe runs along the top of the back wall. To the left is a wooden chest of drawers with some drawers open, and several toy blocks are scattered on the floor in front of it. In the center of the room, a small figure in a yellow raincoat holding a light stands on the raised end of a wooden seesaw. To the right, a simple wooden swing hangs from the ceiling.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres to most of the instructions, but it has a minor weakness in one area.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key elements of a scene that is characteristic of the video game *Little Nightmares*.\n*   Details like the \"yellow raincoat,\" \"wooden plank floor,\" \"chest of drawers,\" \"seesaw,\" and the specific lighting (\"only significant illumination comes from the character's light\") are precise and factually correct for such a scene.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully describes the point of view, environment, setting, and notable visual elements.\n*   **Potential Weakness:** The caption describes a static scene (\"a small figure... stands on the raised end\"). The instructions state, \"If the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements... as well as human-made movements.\" If the character in the video is moving, the seesaw is tilting, the swing is swaying, or the light is flickering, the caption is incomplete because it omits these dynamic aspects. If the video is just a static shot, then the caption is complete.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **POV and Setting:** It correctly identifies the POV (\"third-person 3D game video\") and the indoor setting (\"dimly lit room\").\n    *   **Object Description:** It follows the instructions to describe color (\"yellow raincoat\"), material (\"wooden plank floor,\" \"wooden chest\"), and shape (\"thick, dark pipe\").\n    *   **Conciseness and Tone:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"creepy,\" \"eerie\"), speculative language (\"it appears\"), and forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\").\n    *   **Focus:** It focuses on the setting and scenery, describing the subject's placement and context without excessive detail, as instructed.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n    *   **No Inference:** It does not infer the purpose of the scene (e.g., a puzzle) or what it emphasizes.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary point of non-adherence is the potential omission of motion. The instructions explicitly require describing movement, and by presenting a static snapshot, the caption may not be fully representing the video content.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is **good**. It demonstrates a strong understanding of nearly all the detailed instructions, particularly regarding tone, objectivity, and descriptive focus. Its only potential flaw is the lack of information about motion, which is a key requirement if the video is dynamic. To be perfect, it would need to incorporate any movement present in the scene.",
