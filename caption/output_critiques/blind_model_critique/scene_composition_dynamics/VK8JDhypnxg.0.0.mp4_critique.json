    "pre_caption": "The scene depicts a misty, overcast seascape with a mysterious, vertical structure rising from the water. The setting is outdoors, with the ocean stretching into the distance under a gray sky. The time of day is indeterminate due to the uniform lighting and foggy conditions. The structure is a tall, cylindrical form with a smooth surface, appearing dark against the pale backdrop. The water is calm, with gentle waves lapping at the shore, and the entire scene is enveloped in a thick fog that obscures the horizon. The atmosphere is serene and otherworldly, with the structure standing as the central visual element. There are no overlays or additional elements present in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good in its descriptive accuracy but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene's content. It correctly identifies the \"misty, overcast seascape,\" the \"gray sky,\" the \"indeterminate\" time of day, the \"thick fog,\" and the \"calm\" water.\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the structure as a \"tall, cylindrical form with a smooth surface\" that is \"dark against the pale backdrop\" is precise and matches the visual information perfectly.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Good:** The caption successfully covers most of the required elements: the environment, setting, time of day, weather, and the most notable visual element.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The caption fails to mention the **point of view**. The instructions specifically ask to \"indicate the point of view, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam.\" A description like \"From a static, ground-level point of view\" would have fulfilled this requirement.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction:**\nThis is the area with the most significant issues. The caption violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n*   **Violation:** The instruction states, \"**Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.**\"\n    *   The caption uses the words \"**mysterious**,\" \"**serene**,\" and \"**otherworldly**.\" These are all subjective interpretations of the scene's mood and atmosphere, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation:** The instruction states, \"**Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.**\"\n    *   The caption includes the phrase, \"...with the structure standing as the **central visual element**.\" This directly explains the compositional emphasis of the scene, which the instructions prohibit.\n*   **Minor Violation:** The instruction states, \"**Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options...**\"\n    *   The caption uses the phrase \"**appearing dark**.\" While a very common and natural phrasing, a stricter adherence to the rule would use a more direct statement, such as \"The structure is dark against the pale backdrop.\"\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the caption provides a factually correct and well-written description of the video's content, it fails on key points of the instructions. The inclusion of subjective/emotional language and the explanation of compositional focus are direct violations of the rules. To be compliant, the caption would need to be rewritten to be more objective and to include the point of view.",
