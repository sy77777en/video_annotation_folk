    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors, looking toward a large frosted window that diffuses the daylight and obscures the view outside. The setting appears to be a small, enclosed space with dark-colored walls and a door or window frame that is rectangular and made of metal or painted wood. On the left side, a blue plastic storage bin holds various items, including a red and white object and a brush with dark bristles. On the right, a dark, rounded object rests near the floor, and in the center, a stack of black containers or cases is visible. The lighting is soft and cool, with the natural light from outside creating a muted, subdued atmosphere. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main elements but could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions against speculation and ambiguity. The final sentence, \"This enclosed indoor space is possibly the cargo bed of a truck,\" is speculative and should be removed; instead, the description could incorporate details that imply this setting, such as the slight, constant vibration of the floor and the corrugated texture of the off-white interior walls, suggesting the space is a vehicle. The caption also uses ambiguous phrasing like \"door or window frame\" and \"metal or painted wood,\" which should be replaced with a more definitive description, such as \"the painted metal frame of the rear hatch.\" While the placement of the black bag is noted, the description misses the subtle motion of the light shifting through the frosted window, as if the vehicle is passing under trees or buildings. Furthermore, the objects could be described with greater specificity; the \"brown, rounded object\" is a coiled length of thick rope, and the \"red and white object\" in the blue bin is a small fire extinguisher. Finally, the caption omits the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot from a fixed position inside the cargo area, looking directly toward the rear.",
