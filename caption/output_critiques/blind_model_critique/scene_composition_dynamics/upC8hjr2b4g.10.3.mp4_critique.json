    "pre_caption": "The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room, focusing on a beige, vintage CRT computer monitor placed on a dark wooden desk. The monitor displays a real-time strategy game, showing a map with varied terrain including beige land, green patches representing vegetation, and areas of blue water. A user interface for the game is visible at the bottom of the screen. A beige keyboard and mouse are positioned in front of the monitor. A white, low-poly, stylized human figure appears, with its hands interacting with the keyboard and mouse. An overlay in the bottom left corner of the video displays white text: \"1 vs 7 Hardest AI - [Ethiopians] #1 (2017)\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the core elements like the CRT monitor, the game, and the text overlay, but it lacks dynamism and contextual detail that would be present in the video. The description is static, failing to mention the constant motion on the screen as game units move and the stylized figure's hands rapidly press keys and click the mouse in sync with the gameplay. The point of view, a fixed medium shot focused on the desk, is not specified. The description of the \"dimly lit room\" could be improved by noting that the primary light source is the glow from the CRT monitor, which casts a cool, flickering light on the desk, the keyboard, and the low-poly figure. Furthermore, the caption misses finer details that would be visible, such as the subtle scan lines on the curved CRT screen, the specific wood grain texture of the dark desk, and the presence of a dark gray mousepad beneath the mouse. Finally, the relationship between the stylized figure and the gameplay is not made explicit; the caption should clarify that this animated figure is a representation of the player, whose actions directly correspond to the events unfolding in the game on the monitor.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a fixed medium shot of a dimly lit room, where the primary light source is the cool, flickering glow of a vintage beige CRT monitor. This light casts dynamic shadows on a dark wooden desk, highlighting its distinct wood grain texture. The monitor displays a real-time strategy game in motion, with units moving across a map featuring varied terrain of beige land, green vegetation, and blue water. The game’s user interface is visible at the bottom of the screen. In front of the monitor, a beige keyboard and mouse rest on a dark gray mousepad. A white, low-poly, stylized human figure, representing the player, is animated with hands rapidly pressing keys and clicking the mouse in sync with the gameplay. Subtle scan lines ripple across the curved CRT screen, adding to the retro aesthetic. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads: \"1 vs 7 Hardest AI - [Ethiopians] #1 (2017).\"",
