    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting with a classic car as the central focus. The environment is dimly lit, creating a subdued atmosphere with soft shadows. The car, a vintage model with a rounded shape, features a beige color and smooth, polished metal surfaces. Its distinct design includes rounded headlights and a curved roof. The floor is dark and unadorned, complementing the car's presence. The lighting highlights the car's contours, emphasizing its classic form. Overlay elements, such as text or icons, are present, positioned in the lower left corner, providing additional information without obstructing the view of the car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but has several significant flaws in accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions. While it correctly identifies the main subject and general environment, it misses key details and violates several negative constraints.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the car as a \"classic,\" \"vintage model with a rounded shape,\" \"beige color,\" with \"smooth, polished metal surfaces,\" \"rounded headlights,\" and a \"curved roof\" is accurate. The description of the \"indoor setting,\" \"dimly lit\" environment, and \"dark and unadorned\" floor is also correct.\n*   **Inaccurate/Vague:** The caption states the overlay contains \"text or icons... providing additional information.\" This is too vague. The instruction requires describing the *content* of the overlay. The caption fails to mention the specific text \"Volkswagen Beetle 1967\" or identify the social media engagement icons (Like, Comment, Share, Save).\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Missing Point of View and Motion:** The caption completely omits the camera's motion. The video features a slow, smooth camera movement panning across the car. The instructions explicitly require a description of motion, and this is a defining characteristic of the video that is not mentioned.\n*   **Incomplete Overlay Description:** As mentioned under accuracy, the description of the overlay is incomplete because it does not specify its content, which is a direct requirement of the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to follow several key negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation:** The caption states, \"The lighting highlights the car's contours, **emphasizing its classic form**.\"\n    *   **Instruction Violated:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The phrase \"emphasizing its classic form\" is an interpretation of the lighting's effect, not a description of the scene itself.\n*   **Violation:** The caption says the floor is \"dark and unadorned, **complementing the car's presence**.\"\n    *   **Instruction Violated:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The word \"complementing\" infers a deliberate design choice and a relationship between elements, which is a form of interpretation.\n*   **Violation:** The caption describes the environment as creating a \"**subdued atmosphere**.\"\n    *   **Instruction Violated:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The term \"subdued atmosphere\" is a subjective interpretation of the mood. A more neutral description would focus on the dim lighting and soft shadows.\n*   **Violation:** The caption states the overlay is \"providing additional information without obstructing the view.\"\n    *   **Instruction Violated:** This is an inferential statement about the purpose and effect of the overlay, rather than a direct description of its content and placement.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully describes the static visual elements of the car and its immediate surroundings. However, it fails by omitting the crucial element of camera motion, providing an incomplete description of the overlay, and repeatedly violating instructions to avoid interpretation, subjective language, and explaining emphasis. To be considered good, the caption would need to include the camera movement and specific overlay content while removing all interpretive and subjective phrases.",
