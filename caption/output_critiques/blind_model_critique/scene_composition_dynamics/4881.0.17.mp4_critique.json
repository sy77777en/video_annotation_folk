    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. Every element described is present and correctly identified:\n*   **Setting:** It is an indoor, dimly lit room with dark blue walls.\n*   **Subjects & Furniture:** A group of people is seated on a large red and gold patterned cushion around a low table.\n*   **Props:** A pink pillow, a crystal decanter, a two-tiered white side table with a lamp, and a shelf are all accurately placed and described.\n*   **Atmosphere:** The presence of \"wisps of smoke\" is a correct and important detail.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a comprehensive yet concise overview of the scene. It successfully captures the most significant visual information without getting bogged down in minor details. It covers the environment, key objects, and the general context of the subjects, fulfilling the requirement for an informative description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the scene in a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** The description prioritizes the environment and notable visual elements over the subjects, as requested.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"cozy,\" \"it appears,\" \"they might be\").\n*   **No Inferred Purpose:** The caption describes what is visible without inferring the nature of the gathering (e.g., party, meeting).\n*   **Specific Details:** It correctly includes details about color (\"dark blue,\" \"red and gold,\" \"pink,\" \"white\"), material (\"crystal\"), and shape (\"two-tiered\").\n*   **Motion:** It correctly notes the presence of smoke, which is the main element of motion in the scene.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n\nThe only minor point from the instructions that is not explicitly included is the **point of view** (e.g., \"a static, eye-level shot\"). However, for a simple, stationary scene like this, its omission does not detract from the overall quality and clarity of the description. The caption is a near-perfect execution of the given rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An indoor scene unfolds in a dimly lit room with dark blue walls. A group of people is gathered around a low table, seated on a large red and gold patterned cushion, with a pink pillow resting on it. On the table, a crystal decanter is prominently displayed. In the background, a two-tiered white side table holds a lamp and other small items, while a shelf is mounted on the back wall. Wisps of smoke drift through the air, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static setting.",
