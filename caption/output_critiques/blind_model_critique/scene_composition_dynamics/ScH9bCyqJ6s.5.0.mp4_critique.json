    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good and effectively follows the instructions. It accurately and comprehensively describes the video's content while adhering to the specified formatting and stylistic rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key objects and their specific features:\n*   **Motherboard:** Accurately described as blue.\n*   **Camera Module:** Correctly identified as a \"triple-camera module\" with a \"vertical\" arrangement.\n*   **Metal Shield:** Precisely described as \"square, silver-colored metal.\"\n*   **Screwdriver:** The description of a \"silver, metallic screwdriver with a hexagonal handle\" is detailed and correct.\n*   **Action:** The motion of using the screwdriver to \"point at and touch\" the lenses is accurately captured.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and includes all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"overhead POV\" and \"top-down perspective.\"\n*   **Environment:** The \"white surface\" serves as the immediate setting.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** All prominent objects (motherboard, camera, shield, screwdriver) and their characteristics (color, material, shape) are included.\n*   **Subjects and Motion:** The presence of hands and the action of pointing with the screwdriver are described, providing context for the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully adheres to the vast majority of the detailed instructions.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or markdown.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), subjective adjectives, and speculative language (\"appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   It focuses on the scenery and objects rather than the person.\n    *   It does not infer the purpose of the action (e.g., repair, demonstration).\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and descriptive.\n\n*   **Minor Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Redundancy:** The phrase \"An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective\" is slightly redundant. A more concise version like \"A top-down shot shows...\" or \"From an overhead perspective...\" would be more efficient while still fulfilling the instruction.\n    *   **Sentence Structure:** The caption uses two sentences. While not explicitly forbidden, combining them could create a smoother flow. For example: \"From a top-down perspective, a pair of hands holds a blue smartphone motherboard against a white surface, while a person uses a silver, metallic screwdriver...\" This also resolves the slight awkwardness of \"a pair of hands holding...\" followed by \"A person uses...\".\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent. The minor points for improvement are stylistic and do not detract from its high quality and adherence to the core requirements of the prompt.",
