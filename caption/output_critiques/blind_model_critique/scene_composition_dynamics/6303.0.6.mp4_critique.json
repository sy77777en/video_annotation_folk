    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors with a tiled floor featuring a checkerboard pattern of green and white squares. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the lighting suggests an evenly lit environment, possibly under artificial light. The main visual element is a smartphone held in the character's hands, displaying vibrant graphics on the screen. The phone's screen shows colorful, playful designs with text and icons, including planets and scissors, against dark backgrounds. The character's hands, adorned with rings and painted nails, interact with the phone, suggesting engagement with the content displayed. The setting is minimal, focusing on the interaction with the device, with no additional furniture or props visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\nThe caption is good and captures the essence of the scene, but it contains several specific violations of the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the video's content. It correctly identifies the point of view, the primary subject (a person using a phone), and the key environmental details (tiled floor). The description of the phone screen and the character's hands is also specific and plausible.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It successfully includes:\n*   **Point of View:** \"first-person POV shot.\"\n*   **Setting:** \"indoors with a tiled floor featuring a checkerboard pattern of green and white squares.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** It correctly notes that the time of day is not clear and describes the lighting.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It describes the smartphone, the graphics on its screen, and the character's hands with rings and painted nails.\n*   **Motion:** It mentions the hands \"interact with the phone.\"\n\nThe caption does a good job of combining details into a single, coherent paragraph without referring to specific frames.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has several clear issues. While it follows many rules, it violates some of the most important negative constraints.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It is a single paragraph without markdown or introductory text.\n*   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It correctly identifies the setting as \"indoors.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery without excessive detail on the subject.\n\n**Violations:**\n1.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions explicitly state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n    *   The caption uses \"**possibly** under artificial light.\" This is a direct violation. It should state the lighting condition directly or not at all.\n    *   The caption uses \"**suggesting** engagement with the content displayed.\" This is an inference about the character's intent, not a direct description of the action. The instruction is to describe what is visible, not what is suggested.\n\n2.  **Explaining Emphasis:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The caption includes the phrase, \"**focusing on the interaction with the device**.\" This is an interpretation of the scene's directorial choice and a direct violation of this rule.\n\n3.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption describes the phone screen's content as \"**playful** designs.\" \"Playful\" is a subjective interpretation of the design's style. A more objective description would stick to colors, shapes, and content (which it also does well).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-structured and provides a good visual summary. However, its primary weakness is the inclusion of speculative, interpretive, and subjective language, which is explicitly forbidden by the detailed instructions. To be fully compliant, it needs to be more objective and descriptive, stating only what is visibly present and happening.\n\nHere is a revised version that adheres more strictly to all instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\nFrom a first-person point of view, a pair of hands with painted nails and rings holds a smartphone indoors. The floor below is tiled in a green and white checkerboard pattern within an evenly lit environment. The smartphone screen displays colorful graphics, text, and icons, including planets and scissors, against dark backgrounds. The hands tap and swipe on the screen. No other furniture or props are visible in the minimal setting.",
