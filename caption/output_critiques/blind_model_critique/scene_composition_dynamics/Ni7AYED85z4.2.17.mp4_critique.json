    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor waterfront scene along a stone-paved promenade beside a wide canal or lagoon. The water is a muted blue-green, with gentle ripples, bordered by a low, curved stone wall. Across the water, a row of multi-story historic buildings with pale facades and rectangular windows lines the opposite bank, partially obscured by a layer of mist or fog that softens the outlines and reduces visibility. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and cool atmosphere, suggesting early morning or late afternoon. Wooden posts rise from the water near the edge of the promenade, and a few boats are faintly visible in the distance. A person in a long, checked coat stands near the water’s edge, facing away, while another person in dark clothing is positioned further along the promenade, both adding a sense of scale and context to the tranquil, misty setting. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **very good** but has a few minor areas where it deviates from the rules. It excels in its descriptive quality and structure but could be improved by removing subjective and speculative language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Strengths (What the Caption Does Well)\n\n*   **Completeness and Detail:** The caption is comprehensive, covering all the required elements: point of view (\"first-person POV\"), setting (\"outdoor waterfront scene\"), environment (\"stone-paved promenade,\" \"wide canal or lagoon\"), time of day/lighting (\"overcast,\" \"subdued lighting\"), and weather (\"mist or fog\").\n*   **Descriptive Quality:** It effectively describes the color (\"muted blue-green,\" \"pale facades\"), material (\"stone-paved,\" \"wooden posts\"), and shape (\"curved stone wall,\" \"rectangular windows\") of key visual elements, as instructed.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description prioritizes the setting and atmosphere over the subjects. The people are mentioned briefly to provide \"scale and context,\" which aligns perfectly with the instruction to complement the scene without excessive detail.\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The description is presented as a single, coherent paragraph that logically moves from the overall scene to more specific details. It avoids using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Handling of Overlays:** It correctly notes the absence of overlays (\"No overlays or digital elements are present\"), showing it followed that specific part of the instruction.\n\n### Weaknesses (Where the Caption Deviates from Instructions)\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using the word **\"tranquil\"** to describe the setting. While the scene may evoke that feeling, the word itself is an emotional interpretation.\n*   **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction warns against speculative statements like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\" The phrase **\"suggesting early morning or late afternoon\"** is speculative. A more compliant description would state the observable facts, such as \"The scene has subdued lighting consistent with early morning or late afternoon.\"\n*   **Use of Ambiguous Options:** The instruction says to avoid ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" The caption uses **\"canal or lagoon\"** and **\"mist or fog.\"** While visually it might be hard to distinguish, a better approach would be to choose the most likely term or a more general one (e.g., \"waterway,\" \"haze\").\n*   **Slightly Interpretive Language:** Phrases like **\"contributing to the subdued lighting\"** and **\"adding a sense of scale and context\"** explain the *function* or *effect* of an element, which borders on interpreting what the scene emphasizes, something the instructions advise against. A more direct description would simply state the elements are present.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **highly effective** and captures the essence of the scene with great accuracy and detail. It successfully follows the majority of the complex instructions. However, to be perfect, it would need to be revised to eliminate the few instances of subjective, speculative, and interpretive language, making it a purely objective and factual description as required by the prompt.",
