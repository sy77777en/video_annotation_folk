    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit entryway of a home, a dark wooden door is positioned in the center, slightly ajar with light seeping from underneath. To the left of the door, a wooden console table holds a lit lamp with a white shade, two framed photographs, and a small bowl. A standing coat rack stands in the far-left corner, and a small, framed picture hangs on the off-white wall above the table. To the right of the door, a low, light-colored wooden shoe rack holds a pair of white sneakers, positioned next to a potted plant with dark leaves. A large, vertically oriented framed artwork hangs on the wall above the shoe rack. The scene is illuminated primarily by the single lamp, which casts long shadows across the room and onto the dark wood floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately inventories the objects within the entryway, but it fails to capture the dynamic nature of the video, describing it as a static photograph instead. The video is not a fixed shot but is filmed from a first-person, eye-level point of view, with the camera performing a slow, steady pan from left to right. This movement is crucial as it causes the warm light from the lamp to glint and shift across the glossy finish of the dark wood floor and the glass surfaces of the framed photographs and artwork. The caption also misses the subtle contrast in lighting; the lamp casts a soft, yellow glow, while the light seeping from under the ajar door is a cooler, brighter white and flickers faintly, suggesting activity in the other room. Furthermore, the description of the potted plant is incomplete; as the camera pans, it reveals the plant is a fiddle-leaf fig with large, waxy leaves that reflect the lamplight. Finally, the caption omits a small, semi-transparent channel watermark present in the bottom-right corner throughout the video.",
