    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, begins by looking up at an ornate, coffered ceiling inside a grand, dimly lit hall. Two large, bowl-shaped chandeliers with dark metalwork hang from the ceiling, illuminating decorative friezes with inscriptions along the upper walls. The view tilts down to reveal a large, arched window framed by a string of small, bright lights. Through the window panes, a street scene with a parked car is visible in the evening light. The perspective continues downward, showing a wide staircase with marble-like balustrades leading to a landing with an intricate mosaic tile floor, where a person with blonde hair is seen from behind.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the camera's downward tilt, but it misses opportunities to provide more specific visual detail that would be present in the video. For instance, while the hall is \"dimly lit,\" the caption could specify the color of the light from the chandeliers, such as a warm, golden glow that casts deep shadows. The \"decorative friezes\" could be described with more material detail, such as being gilded or carved from dark wood, and the \"inscriptions\" could be noted as being illegible decorative text. The term \"marble-like\" is ambiguous; a more direct description, such as \"polished white stone with grey veining,\" would be clearer. The \"intricate mosaic tile floor\" lacks a description of its colors or pattern, which might be a prominent geometric design in black, white, and gold. The \"street scene\" is vague; it could be enhanced by noting the time of day more precisely, like dusk, with streetlights beginning to reflect on wet pavement. Finally, the phrase \"as if through the character’s eyes\" is slightly interpretive; stating it is a \"first-person point of view\" is sufficient.",
