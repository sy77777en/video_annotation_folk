    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a public gazebo located in a city square. The time of day is during daylight, with clear skies visible through the open structure. The gazebo features ornate metal railings and a wooden roof with a decorative pattern. Surrounding the gazebo, there are bare trees and multi-story buildings, indicating an urban environment. The scene includes a person in a distinctive costume, moving within the gazebo, with the cityscape providing a backdrop. The setting is calm, with no visible weather disturbances, and the architectural elements suggest a blend of traditional and urban styles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the main elements like the outdoor gazebo in a city square during an overcast day, but it lacks crucial details and includes prohibited subjective language. It fails to specify the point of view, which is a static, eye-level shot that makes the viewer feel like a stationary observer. The description of the gazebo's \"ornate metal railings\" and \"wooden roof\" is too general; the railings are black wrought iron, and the hexagonal roof is covered in green shingles, with a wooden starburst pattern visible on its interior ceiling. The surrounding area is paved with red bricks, a detail that is omitted. While the caption mentions a person in costume, it vaguely describes them as \"moving,\" whereas the video shows them performing a slow, deliberate dance. Furthermore, the caption misses a semi-transparent watermark with a username in the bottom-right corner. Finally, it violates the instructions by using the subjective adjective \"calm\" and making an inferential statement that the architecture \"suggests a blend of traditional and urban styles.\"",
