    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a public gazebo located in a city square. The time of day is during daylight, with clear skies visible through the open structure. The gazebo features ornate metal railings and a wooden roof with a decorative pattern. Surrounding the gazebo, there are bare trees and multi-story buildings, indicating an urban environment. The scene includes a person in a distinctive costume, moving within the gazebo, with the cityscape providing a backdrop. The setting is calm, with no visible weather disturbances, and the architectural elements suggest a blend of traditional and urban styles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description (a person in a costume in a gazebo in a city square), the caption is factually accurate in its description of the objects, environment, and time of day.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete. The instructions explicitly require mentioning the **point of view** (e.g., first-person, drone shot, eye-level), which is entirely missing from the description. This is a significant omission as the POV is a fundamental aspect of how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption violates multiple negative constraints outlined in the instructions:\n\n1.  **Use of Inferential and Speculative Language:** The instructions state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" The caption violates this with the phrases:\n    *   \"...**indicating** an urban environment.\" (This is an inference; the description should simply state that multi-story buildings are present).\n    *   \"...architectural elements **suggest** a blend of traditional and urban styles.\" (This is a speculative interpretation of style, using the forbidden word \"suggest\").\n\n2.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses the word \"calm\" (\"The setting is calm...\"), which is a subjective interpretation of the scene's atmosphere. A more objective description would focus on the lack of movement, such as \"There is no other visible activity in the surrounding area.\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption successfully describes the basic setting and visual elements in a single paragraph, it fails by omitting the required point of view and including forbidden speculative and subjective language, making it a poor fit for the detailed instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an outdoor setting in a public gazebo located in a city square, viewed from an eye-level perspective. The time of day is during daylight, with clear skies visible through the open structure. The gazebo features ornate metal railings and a wooden roof with a decorative pattern. Surrounding the gazebo are bare trees and multi-story buildings, clearly depicting an urban environment. A person in a distinctive costume moves within the gazebo, with the cityscape providing a backdrop. The scene is static, with no visible weather disturbances, and the architectural elements combine traditional and urban styles.",
