    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** In a dark, undefined space with a reflective floor, three stylized figures stand in a row against a black background. The two outer figures are identical, rendered in a reddish-brown, mesh-like texture, and depicted as soldiers in uniform holding rifles. Positioned between them is a central figure, distinguished by a solid, bright red color and a long coat, though it shares a similar mesh texture. The scene is static. An overlay of white text is present in the lower-left corner.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is excellent and adheres very closely to the provided instructions. It is accurate, concise, and descriptive.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene as a \"dark, undefined space with a reflective floor\" and a \"black background\" is perfectly accurate.\n*   The descriptions of the figures are precise. \"Reddish-brown, mesh-like texture\" for the soldiers and \"solid, bright red color\" with a \"similar mesh texture\" for the central figure correctly capture their appearance.\n*   The identification of the outer figures as \"soldiers in uniform holding rifles\" is a correct and concise interpretation of the visual information.\n*   The placement of the figures (\"in a row,\" \"outer figures,\" \"central figure\") is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the key elements requested: the environment, the subjects, their visual properties (color, texture), and their arrangement.\n*   It correctly notes the static nature of the scene, fulfilling the requirement to describe motion (or the lack thereof).\n*   It identifies the overlay, its color, and its position.\n*   **Minor Point for Improvement:** The instruction asks to describe the **content** of overlays. The caption mentions \"white text\" but does not specify that the text reads \"A-1 Pictures\". Including this detail would make it fully complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"menacing,\" \"heroic\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **Focus:** It focuses on describing the visual elements of the setting and subjects without inferring a narrative or purpose.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay\" and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Overall Adherence:** The caption demonstrates a near-perfect understanding and application of the detailed instructions. The only deviation is the minor omission of the overlay's text content.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good. It is a high-quality description that is accurate, objective, and almost perfectly aligned with the complex set of rules provided. To make it flawless, you would only need to add the specific content of the text overlay.",
