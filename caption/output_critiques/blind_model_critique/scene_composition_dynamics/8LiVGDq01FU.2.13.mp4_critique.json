    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies the subject as a person in an astronaut suit and describes its features (white and grey color, reflective visor, circular emblem). The description of the background with its horizontal bars of bright white light is also precise. However, the phrase \"possibly part of a larger structure or machinery\" is speculative. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" This part of the caption violates that rule by guessing the nature of the background elements.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. It fails to include several key details required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The caption does not specify the POV (e.g., static shot, third-person view), which is a required element for describing how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n*   **Motion or Changes:** As this is a video description, any motion is a critical detail. The caption does not mention if the person is moving, if the lights are flickering, or if the camera is panning or static. The instructions require a description of \"motion or changes,\" and its absence is a significant omission.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to some instructions well but fails on several critical points.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, concise paragraph.\n*   It correctly identifies the setting as \"indoors.\"\n*   It describes the color, shape, and features of notable elements (the suit, the lights).\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, using descriptive terms like \"dimly lit\" and \"high contrast.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery without excessive detail on the subject.\n*   It does not use forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   **Speculation:** It uses the word \"possibly,\" which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Missing Key Information:** It omits the POV and any description of motion, both of which are required components according to the instructions.\n*   **Clarity on Background:** While it describes the background, stating it is \"blurred\" and then describing \"prominent horizontal bars\" is slightly contradictory. A better phrasing might be \"The out-of-focus background features...\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a good starting point but is not a good caption according to the strict rules provided. It fails by including speculative language and omitting mandatory information like the point of view and a description of motion, which are essential for describing a video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is presented in a third-person view with a static shot in a dimly lit indoor setting. A person wearing a white and grey astronaut suit stands in the foreground, featuring a helmet with a clear, reflective visor and a circular emblem on the chest. The out-of-focus background contains prominent horizontal bars emitting a bright white light. The scene is characterized by low-key lighting with high contrast between the illuminated elements and the surrounding darkness. There is no noticeable motion from the person or changes in the lighting.",
