    "pre_caption": "An underwater scene unfolds on a sunlit coral reef, where a large sea turtle with a dark, mottled shell swims slowly over the sandy ocean floor. The turtle's head and flippers are covered in a distinct black-and-white geometric pattern. The surrounding environment is a vibrant ecosystem filled with various coral formations, including tan branching corals and convoluted, yellow-green brain corals. Sunlight penetrates the clear blue water, casting shifting light patterns across the seabed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a large sea turtle and precisely describes its features, such as the \"dark, mottled shell\" and the \"distinct black-and-white geometric pattern\" on its skin. The description of the environment is also spot-on, mentioning the \"sandy ocean floor,\" \"tan branching corals,\" and \"convoluted, yellow-green brain corals.\" The detail about sunlight creating \"shifting light patterns\" is an excellent and accurate observation.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering all the essential aspects of the scene as required by the instructions. It includes the setting (underwater coral reef), time of day (sunlit), key subject (sea turtle), notable environmental details (coral types, sandy floor), and motion (\"swims slowly,\" \"shifting light patterns\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is both concise and informative.\n    *   **Focus:** It successfully focuses on describing the setting and scenery while integrating the subject's context and movement, as instructed.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective language. While \"vibrant\" can be subjective, in this context, it serves as an effective descriptor for a colorful and lively ecosystem. It correctly avoids speculation, inference, and terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Detail:** The caption provides specific details about color, shape, and pattern (\"dark, mottled,\" \"black-and-white geometric pattern,\" \"tan branching,\" \"convoluted, yellow-green\") without being excessive.\n    *   **Motion:** The description of the turtle swimming and the light shifting effectively captures the dynamic elements of the video.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an excellent example that perfectly follows the provided instructions. It is accurate, detailed, objective, and well-written, providing a clear and complete picture of the video's content.",
