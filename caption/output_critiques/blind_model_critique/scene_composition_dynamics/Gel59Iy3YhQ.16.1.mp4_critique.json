The scene is set in an outdoor, pixel-art environment against a stylized sky composed of horizontal bands of color, transitioning from light pink at the top to a deep red at the bottom.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good, but it has a few minor issues that prevent it from being perfect. It successfully captures the main visual elements and style of the scene, but it violates a few specific negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the scene's visual components is highly accurate. The \"pixel-art environment,\" \"stylized sky composed of horizontal bands of color,\" \"grey, blocky stone pillars,\" \"patches of green grass, vines, and small red flowers,\" and \"small, white, bird-like characters\" are all precise and correct descriptions of what is visible.\n*   **Good:** The identification of the point of view as \"top-down or oblique top-down\" is correct, as the camera is positioned above the action with a slight angle.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Good:** The caption effectively covers the point of view, setting (outdoor), environment (floating pillars), and notable visual elements (flora, other creatures, broken platform). It correctly identifies the \"pixel-art\" style.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The instructions state, \"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe... human-made movements.\" The video clearly shows a character jumping between platforms, but the caption only describes a static scene and does not mention this movement.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThis is where the caption has the most room for improvement.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than giving excessive detail about the main subject.\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It correctly describes elements by color, material, and shape.\n\n**Where it deviates from the instructions:**\n*   **\"A gaming video...\"**: This violates the rule, **\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"** By identifying it as a \"gaming video,\" the caption explains the context and purpose of the scene, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   **\"...top-down or oblique top-down view...\"**: This violates the rule, **\"Avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"** The caption should commit to the most accurate description (\"oblique top-down view\") rather than presenting an option.\n*   **\"...where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them.\"**: This is redundant and violates the \"concise\" instruction. The term \"top-down view\" already conveys this information.\n*   **Missing Motion:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" it fails to adhere to the instruction to describe movement when present.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because its descriptive content is accurate and detailed. However, to be fully compliant with the instructions, it needs to be revised to remove the inference about it being a \"gaming video,\" eliminate the ambiguity in the POV description, remove the redundant explanation of the camera angle, and add a brief mention of the character's movement between platforms.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an outdoor, pixel-art environment, the scene features an oblique top-down view of a character navigating a series of floating, grey, blocky stone pillars. The stylized sky transitions from light pink at the top to deep red at the bottom. Patches of green grass, vines, and small red flowers adorn some platforms, while small, white, bird-like characters perch on various ledges. In the upper right, a darker, broken platform hovers. The character is seen jumping between platforms, adding dynamic movement to the scene.",
