    "pre_caption": "In an indoor commercial space with a white refrigerator and a metal counter holding a digital scale, a man in a beige apron places items into a large, open delivery bag. The bag, held by a man in a red and black jacket, is red with black trim and has a silver, insulated interior. The man in the jacket then closes the lid of the bag, which has a white reflective stripe on its exterior.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions, providing a description that is accurate, objective, and well-structured. It successfully focuses on the scene and key visual elements while describing the action concisely.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It uses precise language for colors (\"beige,\" \"red with black trim\"), materials (\"metal,\" \"silver, insulated interior\"), and specific features (\"digital scale,\" \"white reflective stripe\").\n*   It accurately captures the sequence of actions: a man placing items into a bag, another man holding it, and then that man closing the bag.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption effectively describes the most important elements: the setting, the key props (refrigerator, counter, scale, bag), the subjects (described by their attire), and the central action.\n*   It successfully combines details from the entire video into a single, coherent narrative, describing the process from the bag being open to it being closed.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption does not mention the **point of view** (e.g., eye-level, high-angle) or the **time of day**. However, for a simple indoor scene like this, the POV may not be a defining feature, and the time of day is likely not discernible or relevant. The instructions state to include these \"if relevant,\" so their omission here is acceptable.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the specific rules outlined in the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a single, efficient paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** It establishes the \"indoor commercial space\" and populates it with key props before detailing the action, perfectly aligning with the instruction to focus on setting and scenery.\n*   **Subject Description:** Subjects are described minimally by their clothing and role in the action (\"man in a beige apron places items,\" \"held by a man in a red and black jacket\"), which perfectly follows the rule to complement the scene without excessive detail.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n*   **No Inference:** It correctly identifies the location as a \"commercial space\" without inferring a specific business type like \"restaurant\" or \"delivery hub.\"\n*   **Formatting and Prohibited Terms:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, and it correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Motion:** The description of motion (\"places items,\" \"closes the lid\") is clear and integrated naturally into the overall scene description.",
