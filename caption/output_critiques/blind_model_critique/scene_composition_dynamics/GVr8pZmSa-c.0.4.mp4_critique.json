    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wooden sailing ship, featuring dark, unfurled sails and a railed deck, caught in a turbulent, dark blue ocean under dark, stormy skies. A few small, pale figures are visible on its deck. Large, white-capped waves relentlessly batter the wooden vessel, causing it to rock violently and tilt precariously. The ship begins to break apart as it is progressively overwhelmed by the churning water, its stern section submerges, and the entire vessel sinks beneath the surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the vast majority of the detailed instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured. However, there is one minor area where it deviates from the rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It provides a logical and believable sequence of events, describing a ship in a storm from its initial struggle to its eventual sinking. The details provided, such as the \"wooden sailing ship,\" \"dark, unfurled sails,\" and \"white-capped waves,\" create a clear and precise mental picture of the scene.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"filmed by a drone.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly described as a \"turbulent, dark blue ocean.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Established with \"dark, stormy skies.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The ship is described with its material (\"wooden\"), features (\"unfurled sails,\" \"railed deck\"), and color (\"dark\"). The waves are described by their appearance (\"Large, white-capped\").\n*   **Subjects:** The \"few small, pale figures\" are mentioned with minimal detail and proper context, as instructed.\n*   **Motion and Changes:** The caption excels at describing the entire dynamic arc of the video, from the ship \"rocking violently\" to it breaking apart and sinking. This demonstrates a synthesis of the whole video, not just a single moment.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly, but with one specific deviation.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery over the subjects.\n*   It avoids speculation, inference, and explaining what the scene emphasizes.\n*   It correctly describes the motion and the progression of the scene over time.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n*   The instruction states to **\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"** The caption uses a few words that lean toward subjective interpretation rather than purely objective description.\n    *   **\"relentlessly\"**: This adverb implies a persistent, almost malicious quality to the waves' actions, which is an interpretation. A more neutral alternative would be \"repeatedly\" or simply describing the action without an adverb.\n    *   **\"violently\"**: While descriptive of strong motion, it carries an emotional connotation. A more objective term might be \"severely\" or \"erratically.\"\n    *   **\"precariously\"**: This is borderline, as it describes a state of instability, but it can also imply a sense of danger, which is subjective.\n    *   **\"overwhelmed\"**: This describes the ship's state in human-like terms. A more objective description would be \"inundated by\" or \"submerged by.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is very strong and demonstrates a clear understanding of the instructions. Its only flaw is the use of a few subjective adjectives that add a layer of interpretation, which the rules specifically forbid. By replacing these words with more neutral, objective descriptors, the caption would be in perfect compliance with all instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A video filmed by a drone captures a wooden sailing ship, featuring dark, unfurled sails and a railed deck, caught in a turbulent, dark blue ocean under dark, stormy skies. A few small, pale figures are visible on its deck. Large, white-capped waves repeatedly batter the wooden vessel, causing it to rock severely and tilt in an unstable manner. The ship begins to break apart as it is progressively inundated by the churning water, its stern section submerges, and the entire vessel sinks beneath the surface.",
