    "pre_caption": "The scene takes place on the top level of a concrete parking garage under a clear blue sky on a sunny day. The ground is marked with white painted lines designating parking spaces, including the word \"COMPACT.\" A makeshift ramp made of light brown plywood is set up in an open area. In the background, a lower level of the parking structure is visible, containing parked vehicles such as a white van and a black pickup truck, all behind a metal fence. A person on a gold-colored scooter with turquoise wheels rides up the ramp, performs a backflip in mid-air, and lands. Another person lies on the ground at the base of the ramp, while a third individual stands near a silver truck in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation by identifying the key subjects and the central action, but it could be improved by incorporating more specific details that are likely visible. The point of view is missing; the scene is likely captured from a static, eye-level third-person perspective, which gives the action a stable, observational feel. The description of the person on the ground is ambiguous; the video probably shows the scooter rider jumping directly *over* this person, a crucial detail that defines the stunt. The environment's description is somewhat sterile; adding details like the weathered texture of the concrete, scattered oil stains, or tire marks on the pavement would create a more realistic scene. While the background mentions a lower level, it omits the wider context, such as the tops of distant city buildings or a hazy treeline visible beyond the garage, which would better establish the location. Furthermore, the caption doesn't mention any overlays; a video of this nature would likely have a semi-transparent watermark, such as a social media handle, in a corner. Finally, clarifying that the camera remains stationary throughout the jump would better describe the motion within the scene.",
