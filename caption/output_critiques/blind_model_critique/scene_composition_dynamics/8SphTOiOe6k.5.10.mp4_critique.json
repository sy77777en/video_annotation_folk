    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor street scene in a Japanese setting, likely during the day. The environment features a small, traditional storefront with wooden elements and paper lanterns, creating an authentic cultural atmosphere. A red vending machine and a bicycle with a basket are notable elements, adding to the urban street vibe. The pavement is stone, and the area is bustling with pedestrians, some of whom are wearing casual attire. The scene is lively, with people walking past the shop, which displays various items and signage in Japanese. The overall atmosphere is vibrant and dynamic, reflecting a typical day in a busy neighborhood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly the rules against using subjective language, making interpretations, and using speculative words.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is generally accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies an outdoor Japanese street scene with a traditional storefront, wooden elements, paper lanterns, a red vending machine, a bicycle, stone pavement, and pedestrians. The presence of Japanese signage is also accurately noted.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete as it misses several required details from the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View (POV):** The instructions explicitly require mentioning the POV (e.g., first-person, eye-level, drone shot). The caption fails to include this crucial piece of information.\n*   **Time of Day:** The caption uses the speculative phrase \"likely during the day.\" The instructions require a definitive description based on visual evidence like lighting and shadows, not speculation.\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention whether any overlay elements (text, watermarks, etc.) are present or absent.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails significantly in its adherence to the negative constraints and stylistic guidelines:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"**likely** during the day\" directly violates the rule to avoid words like 'might be' or 'it appears'.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption is filled with subjective words, which are explicitly forbidden. Examples include:\n    *   \"**authentic** cultural atmosphere\"\n    *   \"urban street **vibe**\"\n    *   \"The scene is **lively**\"\n    *   \"The overall atmosphere is **vibrant** and **dynamic**\"\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The caption repeatedly interprets the scene instead of just describing it.\n    *   \"**creating an authentic cultural atmosphere**\" explains the effect of the elements.\n    *   \"**adding to the urban street vibe**\" infers the purpose of the vending machine and bicycle.\n    *   \"**reflecting a typical day in a busy neighborhood**\" is a complete inference about the scene's meaning and context.\n*   **Violation of \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text\":** While the main body is one paragraph, the opening phrase \"The video captures...\" is a form of introductory text. The description should begin directly with the scene itself (e.g., \"An outdoor street scene...\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An outdoor street scene in Japan shows a traditional storefront with wooden elements and paper lanterns. A red vending machine and a bicycle with a basket are present on the stone pavement. Pedestrians in casual attire walk past the shop, which displays items and signage in Japanese. The scene is captured from an eye-level perspective during the day, as indicated by the lighting and shadows. No overlay elements such as text or watermarks are visible.",
