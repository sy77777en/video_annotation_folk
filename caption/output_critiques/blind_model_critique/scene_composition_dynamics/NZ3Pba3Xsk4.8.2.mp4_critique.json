    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves forward along a wooden boardwalk in an outdoor park-like setting during the daytime. The path is lined with lush green trees, and to the left, a railing with glass panels overlooks a rocky enclosure containing a small body of water.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres closely to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is factually correct. The video shows a first-person view of someone walking on a wooden boardwalk in a park-like environment during the day. All the mentioned elements—the green trees, the railing with glass panels, the rocky enclosure with water, the light blue roller coaster, and the people wearing face masks on the boardwalk and dirt path—are present and accurately described.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption includes all the essential information requested. It clearly states the point of view (\"first-person POV shot\"), the motion (\"moves forward\"), the environment (\"outdoor park-like setting\"), the time of day (\"daytime\"), and notable visual elements (boardwalk, railing, roller coaster). It also correctly includes the presence of subjects (people) and their context without excessive detail.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption effectively summarizes the entire scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"exciting\"). The word \"lush\" is descriptive of the dense foliage without being overly emotional.\n    *   **No Speculation:** It refrains from making assumptions, describing the area with the water as a \"rocky enclosure\" rather than guessing its purpose (e.g., \"animal habitat\").\n    *   **Correct Focus:** The description rightly focuses on the setting and scenery, with the people mentioned as part of the overall scene.\n    *   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as instructed.\n    *   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the instructions by providing a clear, objective, and detailed description of the video's content and composition.",
