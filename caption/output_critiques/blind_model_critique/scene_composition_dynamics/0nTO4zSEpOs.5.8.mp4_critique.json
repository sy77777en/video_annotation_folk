    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a first-person POV, depicts an indoor setting within a modern building, featuring a descending escalator. The environment is well-lit, suggesting it is either daytime or brightly illuminated by artificial lighting. The scene includes sleek architectural elements, such as metal railings and smooth walls, with potted plants adding a touch of greenery along the sides. The escalator leads to a lower level, where a few individuals are visible, indicating a public or commercial space. Overlays are present, including a watermark in the lower left corner, which is not part of the scene itself. The overall atmosphere is clean and contemporary, with a focus on the movement down the escalator.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is **partially successful** but contains several significant violations of the provided instructions. While it correctly identifies the main elements of the scene, it fails to adhere to the strict negative constraints outlined in the prompt.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption accurately describes a first-person POV shot of someone on a descending escalator in a modern indoor setting.\n*   **Complete:** It successfully includes the point of view, setting (indoor, modern building), key visual elements (escalator, metal railings, potted plants), motion (descending), and the presence of an overlay (watermark).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to follow several key rules:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid Speculative Statements\" and \"Ambiguous Options\":**\n    *   The caption states the environment is well-lit, *\"suggesting it is either daytime or brightly illuminated by artificial lighting.\"*\n    *   The instruction explicitly forbids speculative statements (\"suggesting\") and ambiguous options (\"A or B\"). The caption should have simply stated that the scene is well-lit without guessing the source.\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Do Not Infer the Role of the Scene Setting\":**\n    *   The caption says the presence of people on the lower level is *\"indicating a public or commercial space.\"*\n    *   This is a direct inference about the function of the location, which the instructions explicitly prohibit.\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives\":**\n    *   The caption uses words like *\"sleek\"* architectural elements and a *\"clean and contemporary\"* atmosphere.\n    *   These are subjective interpretations of the scene's style and feel. The instructions require objective descriptions (e.g., \"metallic railings,\" \"white walls\").\n\n4.  **Violation of \"Do Not Explain What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights\":**\n    *   The final phrase, *\"with a focus on the movement down the escalator,\"* is an analysis of the video's directorial intent or emphasis.\n    *   The instructions clearly state not to explain what the scene emphasizes.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that strictly adheres to all the given instructions:\n\nThe video, captured from a first-person point of view, shows a descent on an escalator within a well-lit, modern indoor building. The scene contains metal railings, smooth walls, and potted plants positioned along the sides of the escalator. On the lower level, a few individuals are present. An overlay watermark is visible in the lower left corner.",
