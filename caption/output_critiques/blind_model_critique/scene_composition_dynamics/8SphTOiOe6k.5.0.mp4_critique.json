On the right, a traditional Japanese-style building with a dark grey tiled roof and wooden upper facade houses a shop with large glass windows and signage in Japanese. A maple tree with vibrant red leaves stands near the building's corner. Several groups of people are present on the paved street and sidewalk: schoolgirls in dark uniforms gather near the shop entrance, two women in patterned red kimonos stand looking at display signs, and other pedestrians, some wearing face masks, walk along the street.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very closely to the provided instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. All the elements mentioned—the first-person POV, the Japanese town setting, the daytime overcast conditions, the specific details of the building (tiled roof, wooden facade), the red maple tree, and the various groups of people (schoolgirls, women in kimonos, pedestrians with masks)—are clearly visible in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully captures the key aspects of the scene as required by the instructions, including:\n    *   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"first-person POV.\"\n    *   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly states \"outdoor street scene in a Japanese town.\"\n    *   **Time of Day & Weather:** Mentions \"daytime\" and that the \"sky appears overcast.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** Provides good detail on the traditional building and the red maple tree, including their placement, color, and materials.\n    *   **Subjects:** Describes the subjects in context (schoolgirls, women in kimonos, pedestrians) without excessive detail, fulfilling the instruction perfectly.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the rules almost perfectly.\n    *   **Strengths:** It is a single, coherent paragraph. It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It focuses on the setting and scenery. It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective language (with one minor exception). It does not infer purpose or meaning.\n    *   **Area for Improvement:** The instruction states, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The phrase \"**The sky appears overcast**\" is a minor violation of this rule. A more direct and compliant phrasing would be \"**The sky is overcast**.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a high-quality caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. With the minor correction of changing \"appears overcast\" to \"is overcast,\" it would be a perfect example of the desired output.",
