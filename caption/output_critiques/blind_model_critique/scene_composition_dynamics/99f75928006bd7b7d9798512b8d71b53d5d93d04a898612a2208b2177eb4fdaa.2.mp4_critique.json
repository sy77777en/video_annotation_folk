    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is factually accurate. The scene is a modern kitchen, it is daytime, and it is brightly lit. The background elements like white cabinets, a tiled backsplash, and under-cabinet lighting are all present. The description of the two women, their actions (eating pizza), their clothing, and the specific detail of the treble clef ring are also correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete. It fails to include the **point of view** (e.g., an eye-level, static shot), which is a required element according to the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the core principles of the instructions in several ways:\n\n1.  **Focus on Subjects Over Scenery:** The instructions explicitly state, \"**Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions**\" and to describe subjects only to \"complement the scene **without excessive detail**.\" The caption dedicates its final, longest sentence to describing the specific patterns of the women's shirts and the unique shape of a ring. This is the exact type of excessive subject detail the instructions forbid.\n2.  **Shifted Emphasis:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" By providing such specific details about the subjects, the caption inadvertently shifts the focus to them, contradicting the primary goal of describing the overall scene and setting.\n\nWhile the caption correctly follows some rules—such as being a single paragraph, avoiding speculative language, and describing the setting and time of day—its failure to prioritize scenery over subject detail is a major flaw that makes it unsuitable.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is set in a brightly lit, modern kitchen during the day, captured from an eye-level, static shot. The background features white cabinets and a tiled backsplash, enhanced by warm under-cabinet lighting.
