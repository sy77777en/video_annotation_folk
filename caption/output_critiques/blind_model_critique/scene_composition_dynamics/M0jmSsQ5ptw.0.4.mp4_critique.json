    "pre_caption": "On a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky, with mountains visible in the distance, a scene is set up for an activity. In the foreground, a raised, black-draped platform is topped with artificial green turf. Next to it stands a black ramp. In the background, there is a large, blue and black inflatable structure and a wooden seesaw with a small tricycle on one end. A person in golf attire stands on the platform next to a golf bag. An overlay of white text reading \"RICKIE FOWLER\" is positioned across the bottom of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main components of the scene, but it lacks the dynamic detail expected from a video description and misinterprets the nature of the text overlay. The description of the person simply \"standing\" fails to capture any motion; in the video, the golfer is seen taking several slow, deliberate practice swings on the turf-covered platform, establishing a sense of preparation. The \"large, blue and black inflatable structure\" is more specifically a large, rectangular inflatable wall serving as a backstop, with a white circular target printed in its center. The description of the \"RICKIE FOWLER\" text as being \"positioned across the top of the raised, black-draped platform\" is incorrect; it is a standard lower-third graphic overlay on the screen, not a physical part of the scene's setup. Furthermore, the caption omits key visual details, such as the bright red color of the small tricycle on the seesaw, which contrasts with the otherwise muted tones of the equipment, and the distinct, short shadows cast by all objects, indicating the scene takes place around midday. While the overall setting is captured, the description feels static and misses the specific actions and visual specifics that define the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Under a partly cloudy sky with distant mountains, a dynamic scene unfolds on a large, paved area. In the foreground, a raised platform draped in black and topped with artificial green turf serves as a stage for action. A black ramp stands beside it. In the background, a large, rectangular inflatable wall in blue and black, featuring a white circular target, acts as a backstop. A wooden seesaw with a bright red tricycle on one end adds a splash of color against the muted tones of the equipment. A golfer in attire, identified as Rickie Fowler by a lower-third graphic overlay on the screen, takes slow, deliberate practice swings on the turf-covered platform, embodying a sense of preparation. The short shadows cast by all objects suggest the scene is set around midday, adding to the vividness of the moment.",
