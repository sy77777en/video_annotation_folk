    "pre_caption": "On a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky, with mountains visible in the distance, a scene is set up for an activity. In the foreground, a raised, black-draped platform is topped with artificial green turf. Next to it stands a black ramp. In the background, there is a large, blue and black inflatable structure and a wooden seesaw with a small tricycle on one end. A person in golf attire stands on the platform next to a golf bag. An overlay of white text reading \"RICKIE FOWLER\" is positioned across the bottom of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is good but has a few key areas for improvement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies the setting as a large paved area with mountains, the objects in the foreground (platform, turf, ramp), the objects in the background (inflatable structure, seesaw, tricycle), the subject (person in golf attire), and the text overlay. The descriptions of color and material (black-draped, artificial green turf, blue and black inflatable, wooden seesaw) are also precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThis is the main area where the caption falls short.\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The instructions require specifying the point of view (e.g., eye-level, static shot), but the caption omits this detail.\n*   **Missing Motion:** The caption describes a static scene. As this is a video, it fails to mention any movement, such as the person's actions, movement of the tricycle, or any camera motion. This is a critical omission for a video description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most of the negative and positive constraints but misses a few.\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n    *   It avoids subjective language, speculation, and terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the text as an \"overlay\" and describes its content and position.\n    *   It keeps the description of the person minimal and contextual.\n    *   It focuses on the setting and scenery.\n\n*   **Where it deviates:**\n    *   **Inference:** The phrase \"a scene is set up for an activity\" infers the purpose of the setting, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\"). It should simply describe the objects present.\n    *   **Missing Required Elements:** As noted under \"Completeness,\" it fails to include the point of view and any description of motion, both of which are required by the instructions for describing a video.\n\nIn summary, the caption is strong at describing the static composition of the scene but is incomplete as a *video* description because it lacks any mention of motion or point of view. It also makes a minor inferential statement against the provided rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an eye-level, static shot of a large, paved area under a partly cloudy sky, with mountains visible in the distance. In the foreground, a raised platform draped in black and topped with artificial green turf is accompanied by a black ramp. A person in golf attire stands on the platform next to a golf bag, occasionally adjusting their stance. In the background, a large blue and black inflatable structure and a wooden seesaw with a small tricycle on one end are visible. The tricycle gently rocks back and forth. An overlay of white text reading \"RICKIE FOWLER\" is positioned across the bottom of the scene.",
