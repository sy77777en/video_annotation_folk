    "pre_caption": "A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen shows a cartoon-styled outdoor garden area at dusk. The scene is illuminated by a warm glow from a lit lantern on a post. The grassy landscape contains several tilled garden plots enclosed by white picket fences; some plots have small green saplings, while another has seeds planted in neat rows. A central feature is a stone well with a wooden roof, surrounded by a circular brick pathway. A small, cloaked character with a round, orange-tinted face walks across the grass, leaving a trail of faint pink particles. In the bottom left corner, a HUD overlay displays a gold coin icon with the number 123. At the bottom center is an inventory bar with icons of bags, a stick, and an orb. On the bottom right, two vertical status bars, one blue and one yellow, are visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main elements of the scene, but it misses some key dynamic and atmospheric details that are present. While it correctly identifies the point of view as third-person, it fails to mention that the camera smoothly follows the character from a slightly elevated angle, panning to keep the well and garden plots in the frame as the character moves. The description of \"dusk\" could be more specific; the sky is not just dark but features a gradient of deep purple and orange hues, with a few stars beginning to appear. The caption also omits the presence of small, glowing blue fireflies that drift lazily around the lantern post and near the stone well, adding to the scene's ambient light. The character's action is more purposeful than just walking; they are holding a small, glowing orb from the inventory bar, which is the source of the faint pink particle trail. Finally, the HUD elements are not static; the blue vertical status bar on the right is slowly depleting as the character walks, indicating it is likely a stamina or magic meter.",
