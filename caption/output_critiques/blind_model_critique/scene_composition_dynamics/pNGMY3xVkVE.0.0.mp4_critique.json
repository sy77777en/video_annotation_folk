    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a dimly lit tunnel, characterized by its metallic walls and ceiling. The environment transitions from a dark, red-tinged atmosphere to a bright, white light at the tunnel's end. The tunnel's structure is cylindrical, with ribbed metal surfaces that create a sense of depth and confinement. The lighting shifts dramatically, initially casting a red hue that highlights the silhouettes of several figures walking towards the light. As the scene progresses, the light intensifies, enveloping the figures and creating a stark contrast with the initial darkness. The overall ambiance is industrial, with a focus on the interplay between light and shadow, emphasizing the tunnel's linear perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is good but fails to follow several key negative constraints in the instructions. It successfully captures the visual essence of the scene but includes subjective interpretations and explanations that were explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the key elements: an indoor tunnel, metallic and ribbed surfaces, a transition from red-tinged darkness to bright white light, and the presence of silhouetted figures moving towards the light.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses two required details:\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions require specifying the POV (e.g., first-person, static shot), but this is not mentioned.\n*   **Time of Day:** This is not mentioned. Even if it is an indoor scene where the time of day is not discernible, the instruction implies it should be addressed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has bottlenections.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Core Description:** It provides a concise and informative description of the setting, materials, colors, and shapes (e.g., \"indoor setting,\" \"metallic walls,\" \"cylindrical,\" \"ribbed metal surfaces,\" \"red-tinged atmosphere\").\n*   **Motion:** It effectively describes motion and change (\"figures walking,\" \"environment transitions,\" \"light intensifies\").\n*   **Subject Detail:** It correctly keeps the description of the subjects minimal (\"silhouettes of several figures\") without excessive detail.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to instructions:**\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"dramatically\" to describe the light shift, which is a subjective assessment of the change's intensity.\n*   **Avoid Explaining What the Scene Emphasizes or Highlights:** This is the most significant violation. The caption explicitly states that the red hue \"highlights the silhouettes\" and that the scene is \"emphasizing the tunnel's linear perspective.\" The instructions strictly forbid explaining what is being emphasized or highlighted.\n*   **Avoid Inferring the Viewer's Perception:** The phrase \"create a sense of depth and confinement\" is an interpretation of how the visual elements affect the viewer, not a direct description of the scene itself.\n*   **Avoid Inferring Style/Ambiance:** The statement \"The overall ambiance is industrial\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's style and mood. The word \"ambiance\" is inherently subjective.\n\nIn summary, while the caption paints an accurate and vivid picture, it violates the instructions by including subjective analysis, interpreting the scene's effect on the viewer, and explaining what the composition \"emphasizes.\" A better caption would stick to purely objective, descriptive language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor tunnel with metallic, ribbed walls and ceiling. The scene transitions from a red-tinged darkness to a bright white light at the tunnel's end. Silhouetted figures are visible walking towards the light. The tunnel is cylindrical, and the lighting changes from red to white as the figures move forward. The point of view is a static shot, and the time of day is not specified.",
