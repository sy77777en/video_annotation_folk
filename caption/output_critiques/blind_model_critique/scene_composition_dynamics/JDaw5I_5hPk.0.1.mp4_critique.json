    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it violates several key instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the \"deep blue ocean water,\" the \"small, choppy waves,\" the constant \"ripples and shifts,\" and the \"purplish light reflecting across the waves.\" The description of the water's texture and movement is precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete. It covers the environment (ocean), motion (ripples, shifts), and notable visual elements (color, texture). It implies the time of day (low light) and the point of view (a static, focused shot).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has significant issues. It fails to follow several negative constraints.\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Avoid ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   The caption says: \"...**suggesting** the low light of **either dawn or dusk**.\"\n    *   The word \"suggesting\" is speculative, and \"either dawn or dusk\" is a direct \"A or B\" violation. A better, non-speculative alternative would be to state the observable fact, such as: \"indicating low light conditions.\"\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The final sentence, \"The view remains **focused on** the dynamic, undulating surface of the sea,\" describes the shot's composition and intent rather than simply describing the scene's content. This explains the camera's focus, which falls under \"highlighting\" an aspect of the shot. This sentence is also redundant, as the preceding descriptions have already established what is visible.\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"**\n    *   The instruction states: \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses the word \"**soft**\" to describe the light. \"Soft\" is a subjective quality. While a minor infraction, a more objective description would simply be \"a purplish light.\"\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all instructions:\n\nA vast expanse of deep blue ocean water fills the frame, its surface textured with a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves. The water ripples and shifts constantly as a purplish light reflects across its dynamic, undulating surface, indicating low light conditions.",
