    "pre_caption": "The scene is set at a paved, banked racetrack at night, illuminated by bright lights. The dark asphalt surface, marked with black tire scuffs and double yellow lines, curves around a green grass infield that has blue and white logos painted on it. In the background, empty grandstands and a catch fence line the outer edge of the track. Several race cars are involved in a crash on the turn. A white and blue car with the number 96 is stopped on the grass, its front end visibly damaged. On the track, a black and yellow car with the number 2 spins, creating a cloud of white smoke. Further up the banked turn, another car tumbles through the air, while other cars pass by the incident on the lower part of the track.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the racetrack setting and the core incident, it omits several key visual details and contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the on-track action. The point of view is a high-angle broadcast shot that pans from the spinning black and yellow car to the stationary white and blue car, but this is not mentioned. The description of other cars \"driving normally\" is incorrect; the video shows them moving at a significantly reduced pace under yellow caution lights that are flashing on a digital pylon just past the crash scene. The caption also completely misses the prominent broadcast overlay at the top of the screen, which displays a running ticker of the race leaderboard and the current lap count. Furthermore, the description of the aftermath is too clean; the track surface around the two crashed cars is visibly littered with small, dark pieces of carbon fiber debris. The \"white smoke\" is not a generic cloud but is specifically billowing from the rear tires of the number 2 car, indicating locked brakes during a spin. Finally, the damage to the number 98 car is more specific than just the \"front end,\" as its hood is crumpled upwards and the front bumper is detached and lying on the grass a few feet away.",
