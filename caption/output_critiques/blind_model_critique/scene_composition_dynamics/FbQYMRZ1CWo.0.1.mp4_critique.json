    "pre_caption": "The scene is set at a dimly lit and crowded indoor social gathering, likely a party or reception. In the foreground, a man with white hair wearing a dark suit jacket and a woman with dark, styled hair are seen smiling. Other attendees are visible in the blurred background, with one woman wearing a leopard-print top and holding a drink. White text overlays are superimposed on the video.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few clear violations of the instructions that prevent it from being excellent.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the setting, the subjects in the foreground, the general appearance of the background, and the specific content and placement of the text overlays.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing a few key details requested in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the point of view (e.g., static eye-level shot, handheld camera). This is a required element.\n*   **Time of Day:** While \"dimly lit\" implies evening or night, the instruction asks to state the time of day, which is omitted.\n*   **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene. If there is any movement in the video (e.g., people talking, shifting, camera movement), it has not been described.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It clearly establishes the scene as a \"dimly lit and crowded indoor social gathering.\"\n*   **Overlays:** It perfectly follows the instructions for overlays by identifying them as \"superimposed,\" describing their color (\"White text\"), content, and precise placement (\"lower-left corner,\" \"upper-right area\").\n*   **Subject Description:** It correctly describes the subjects' placement (\"foreground,\" \"blurred background\") and appearance without excessive detail, focusing on the overall scene.\n*   **Simple Language:** The language is natural, clear, and easy to understand.\n*   **No Emotional or Subjective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives. \"Smiling\" is an objective observation of a facial expression.\n*   **No Inferred Purpose:** It does not speculate on the purpose of the event or the video.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to the instructions:**\n*   **Speculative Language:** The phrase \"**likely** a party or reception\" is a direct violation of the rule: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" It should have been stated more factually, such as \"an indoor social gathering.\" This is the most significant error.\n*   **Missing Required Elements:** As noted under \"Completeness,\" it omits the **point of view**, **time of day**, and any description of **motion**, all of which were explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is well-structured, mostly accurate, and excels at describing the text overlays. However, its use of speculative language is a clear violation of a core rule, and its failure to include the point of view, time of day, and motion makes it incomplete according to the provided instructions.",

In the foreground, a man with white hair wearing a dark suit jacket and a woman with dark, styled hair are seen smiling.
