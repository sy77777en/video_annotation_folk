    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a Minecraft world during the daytime under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The view is from high up, looking at a large, partially constructed white block structure. The structure, made of smooth white blocks, extends upwards and outwards, with the player seemingly adding to it. In the distance, a faint landscape of green and brown is visible far below. A character model, Alex, can be seen on a separate platform in the upper left corner of the view. Overlay elements are present: in the bottom left, an \"X Inventory\" label is next to an inventory bar displaying various colored blocks, with a white block currently selected. In the bottom right, controller button prompts for \"ZL Place\", \"ZR Mine\", \"Y Drop\", and \"B Emote\" are visible. A small white crosshair is centered on the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have watched.\n\nThe caption provides a solid foundation but misses key details about motion and specific in-game terminology that would make it more accurate. The description of the player \"seemingly adding to\" the structure is too passive; the video clearly shows the player's arm model extending into the frame to place each white block, which materializes with a puff of white particle effects. A crucial missing detail is that the first-person view is not static but involves slow, continuous flight, indicated by a gentle drift and rotation around the structure being built. The \"character model\" mentioned is the \"paper doll\" overlay, a specific feature of this version of the game, and it should be noted that this small figure is animated, mimicking the player's flying state. While the blocks are white, describing them as just \"smooth\" is an oversimplification; they are clearly White Concrete blocks, identifiable by their uniform color and very subtle, fine-grained pixelated texture. Lastly, for greater authenticity, the \"inventory bar\" is more commonly referred to as the \"hotbar\" within the game's context.",
