    "pre_caption": "A 3D rendering displays a cross-section of a vehicle's interior, framed within a larger, dark gray structure. The main compartment, seen through a central rectangular cutout, is lined with light wood paneling and has a door at the far end, flanked by two hanging gray jackets. On either side, light brown upholstered benches face each other, occupied by several silver, humanoid figures. The dark gray framing structure also features smaller, rounded-corner cutouts to the left and right, offering partial views of similar interiors. As the view pulls back, a black horizontal line separates the upper section from a lower one, revealing another, more crowded compartment with more silver figures seated inside.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by accurately describing the 3D rendered cross-section, the general layout, and the primary camera motion. However, it misses key details that would be prominent in such a technical visualization. The description of the lighting is absent; the interior is likely illuminated by soft, white LED strips running along the ceiling's edges, which cast gentle highlights on the silver figures and wood paneling. The caption also omits material textures; the dark gray exterior shell probably has a smooth, matte finish, while the floor could be a non-slip, dark composite material. The description of the camera movement as \"pulls back and moves downward\" is correct but could be more specific, as the motion is a single, smooth, continuous dolly and track movement. Furthermore, the \"black horizontal line\" is not a separate element but the physical edge of the upper deck's floor, revealed as the camera descends. The lower compartment is described as \"more crowded,\" but the caption fails to mention that this is due to a denser 2x2 seating arrangement, in contrast to the lounge-style benches above, and includes additional standing figures holding onto vertical silver poles. Most significantly, the caption completely overlooks the informational text overlays that appear. As the camera pulls back, white, sans-serif text materializes, labeling the top section \"UPPER DECK - LOUNGE\" and the bottom section \"LOWER DECK - COMMUTER,\" providing crucial context to the design.",
