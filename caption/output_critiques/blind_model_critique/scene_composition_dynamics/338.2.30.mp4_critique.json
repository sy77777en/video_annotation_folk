    "pre_caption": "The scene is set inside a bustling Chinese restaurant with warm, ambient lighting. The decor features ornate, gold-colored carved wooden panels and a large circular archway leading to another section of the room. Round tables are covered with white tablecloths, and one in the foreground is set with pink napkins, dishes, and a lazy Susan. Various patrons are seated at tables throughout the space, with a waiter in a vest visible in the background. The view is partially obscured by a person with long dark hair in the immediate foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

It correctly identifies the setting as a \"bustling Chinese restaurant,\" the \"warm, ambient lighting,\" the \"ornate, gold-colored carved wooden panels,\" the \"circular archway,\" the table settings including \"pink napkins\" and a \"lazy Susan,\" the presence of patrons, and a \"waiter in a vest.\" Every detail mentioned in the caption is clearly visible in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene. It successfully captures the environment, key architectural and decorative features, props, and the general activity (\"bustling\"). It also crucially includes the person in the foreground, which is essential for understanding the composition and point of view.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Tone:** The caption is concise, informative, and written in simple, natural English. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n    *   **Point of View:** It cleverly implies the point of view by stating, \"The view is partially obscured by a person with long dark hair in the immediate foreground,\" which is more descriptive than simply labeling it \"first-person.\"\n    *   **Setting and Elements:** It clearly defines the setting (indoors, Chinese restaurant) and describes notable visual elements with their color (\"gold-colored,\" \"pink\"), material (\"carved wooden\"), and shape (\"circular archway,\" \"round tables\").\n    *   **Subjects:** Subjects (\"patrons,\" \"waiter,\" \"person with long dark hair\") are described in context with their placement, complementing the scene without excessive detail.\n    *   **Forbidden Content:** The caption correctly avoids speculation, inference, emotional language, and forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It focuses on the scenery as instructed.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
