    "pre_caption": "The scene is set inside a bustling Chinese restaurant with warm, ambient lighting. The decor features ornate, gold-colored carved wooden panels and a large circular archway leading to another section of the room. Round tables are covered with white tablecloths, and one in the foreground is set with pink napkins, dishes, and a lazy Susan. Various patrons are seated at tables throughout the space, with a waiter in a vest visible in the background. The view is partially obscured by a person with long dark hair in the immediate foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the setting as a Chinese restaurant and notes the key architectural elements like the carved panels and circular archway. However, it misses specifying the first-person point of view, which makes the viewer feel as if they are walking into the space. The description of the camera movement is slightly inaccurate; the shot is a single, continuous pan from right to left, not a scene that \"transitions\" to something else. The caption could be more specific about the decor, failing to mention the prominent red paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling and the intricate dragon motifs carved into the gold-painted wood. While it mentions dishes on the table, it omits that they are filled with steaming food, a key detail in a restaurant scene. The description of the foreground person is vague; the video clearly shows the back of a person with long dark hair, and the pan begins on them before revealing the rest of the restaurant. Lastly, the caption completely omits the white text overlay in the bottom-left corner that displays the name of the restaurant.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "As the camera pans smoothly from right to left, the viewer is drawn into a bustling Chinese restaurant, experiencing the scene from a first-person perspective. Warm, ambient lighting highlights the ornate decor, featuring gold-colored carved wooden panels adorned with intricate dragon motifs and a large circular archway leading to another section of the room. Red paper lanterns hang prominently from the ceiling, adding to the authentic atmosphere. Round tables, covered with white tablecloths, are set with pink napkins and dishes filled with steaming food, centered around a lazy Susan. Various patrons are seated throughout the space, while a waiter in a vest is visible in the background. The pan begins on the back of a person with long dark hair in the immediate foreground, gradually revealing the lively restaurant scene.
