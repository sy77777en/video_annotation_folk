    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, and takes place indoors within a dimly lit, narrow hallway of a house or building. The environment features wooden floors and walls, with a large glass door at the end of the hallway revealing an outdoor area engulfed in flames and heavy smoke, suggesting a fire outside. A figure in military gear, wearing camouflage and carrying equipment, moves ahead in the hallway, their placement reinforcing the sense of urgency. The scene transitions to a chaotic outdoor setting filled with debris, broken wooden planks, and intense fire, with thick smoke and embers filling the air. The color palette is dominated by dark browns, yellows, and the orange glow of fire. Overlay elements are present, including a faint white reticle or crosshair at the center of the view, which is not part of the physical scene but appears as a visual aid on the display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent and detailed analysis of the caption. The feedback is broken down logically and provides specific examples of where the caption succeeds and where it fails to meet the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully captures the main visual and narrative elements of the video, including the point of view, setting, and key actions. However, it violates several of the negative constraints in the instructions, particularly those related to avoiding speculation, inference, and subjective language.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy\n\n*   **High:** The caption accurately describes a plausible video scene, likely from a first-person video game or action movie. It correctly identifies the first-person POV, the indoor-to-outdoor transition, the presence of fire and smoke, a figure in military gear, and a HUD/overlay element (the reticle). The description of the environment (narrow hallway, wooden materials, fiery outdoors) is factually sound based on the description itself.\n\n#### Completeness\n\n*   **Mostly Complete:** The caption successfully includes most of the required elements:\n    *   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"first-person POV.\"\n    *   **Setting:** Clearly described as an \"indoors\" hallway transitioning to an \"outdoor setting.\"\n    *   **Notable Visual Elements:** Mentions the glass door, fire, smoke, embers, debris, and the overlay reticle.\n    *   **Material/Color:** Describes \"wooden floors and walls,\" a \"glass door,\" and a color palette of \"dark browns, yellows, and the orange glow of fire.\"\n    *   **Motion & Transition:** Clearly states that the figure \"moves ahead\" and that the \"scene transitions to a chaotic outdoor setting.\"\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption mentions the scene is \"dimly lit\" but does not explicitly state the **time of day** (e.g., \"night\"), which was a specific requirement in the instructions.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has the most room for improvement. It fails to follow several key negative constraints.\n\n**Where it Adhered:**\n\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It correctly identifies the overlay as \"not part of the physical scene.\"\n*   It combines details to describe the overall scene.\n*   It describes the subject's placement and context without excessive detail.\n\n**Where it Deviated (Violations):**\n\n1.  **Use of Ambiguous Options (\"A or B\"):**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...hallway of a **house or building**.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...a faint white **reticle or crosshair**...\"\n    *   **Correction:** The caption should have committed to one term or used a more general one (e.g., \"a building,\" \"a targeting reticle\").\n\n2.  **Use of Speculative and Inferential Language:**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or 'suggesting'.\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...**suggesting** a fire outside.\"\n    *   **Correction:** It should state only what is visible: \"...revealing an outdoor area with flames and heavy smoke.\"\n\n3.  **Explaining Emphasis and Using Subjective Language:**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" and \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...their placement **reinforcing the sense of urgency**.\"\n    *   **Correction:** This is a direct interpretation of the scene's emotional impact. It should be removed entirely.\n\n4.  **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...transitions to a **chaotic** outdoor setting...\" and \"...**intense** fire...\"\n    *   **Correction:** \"Chaotic\" and \"intense\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's state. The caption should stick to objective descriptions, such as \"an outdoor setting filled with debris, broken wooden planks, and fire.\" The visual elements themselves convey the intensity without needing the adjective.\n\n5.  **Inferring Purpose:**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\" (This extends to elements within the scene).\n    *   **Caption:** \"...appears as a **visual aid** on the display.\"\n    *   **Correction:** Stating its purpose as a \"visual aid\" is an inference. It should simply be described: \"...a faint white reticle is overlaid at the center of the view.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a strong first draft that successfully describes the scene's content. Its primary weakness is the failure to adhere strictly to the negative constraints. By removing the speculative, inferential, and subjective phrases, the caption would be in full compliance with the instructions, resulting in a more objective and clinical description as requested.",
