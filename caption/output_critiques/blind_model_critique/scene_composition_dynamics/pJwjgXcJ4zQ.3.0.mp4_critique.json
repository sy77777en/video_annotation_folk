    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing a bustling urban street scene in a vibrant city setting. The environment is outdoors, featuring a narrow street lined with colorful storefronts and bright signage. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with natural light illuminating the scene. Notable visual elements include a variety of shopfronts with vivid, multicolored signs and displays, some featuring neon lights. The street is paved and relatively clean, with a few pedestrians casually walking along the sidewalk. The architecture is modern, with a mix of glass and metal materials. A few bicycles are parked along the street, and small potted plants add a touch of greenery. The overall atmosphere is lively and dynamic, reflecting the energy of a busy urban area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have just watched.\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the first-person point of view and the outdoor urban setting, but it contains speculative language and misses key visual details. The statement that the time of day \"could be interpreted as either early morning or late afternoon\" is ambiguous and violates the instruction to be definitive; the long shadows and illuminated neon signs clearly indicate it is late afternoon. The description also uses forbidden subjective adjectives like \"vibrant,\" \"lively,\" and \"dynamic.\" The caption fails to mention a crucial environmental detail: the pavement is wet from a recent rain, causing colorful reflections from the shop signs, which are a mix of glowing neon and LED displays with non-Latin characters. The description of \"typical colored yellow lights\" is inaccurate; the light is a combination of the multicolored signs and warm interior lighting from the shops. Furthermore, while it mentions pedestrians, it omits the continuous forward motion of the camera itself, which is a defining characteristic of the first-person walk-through. The street is narrower than a standard lane, appearing more like a pedestrian-focused alley.",
