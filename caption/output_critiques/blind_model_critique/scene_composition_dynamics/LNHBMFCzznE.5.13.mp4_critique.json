    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good. While it accurately describes some visual elements, it fails to meet several key requirements of the instructions, resulting in an incomplete and non-compliant description.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   The description of the backdrop as \"vibrant blue,\" composed of \"abstract, geometric shapes with sharp angles and intersecting planes,\" is accurate and detailed.\n*   The statement that the lighting is \"focused on the stage\" and makes the background \"bright and saturated\" is also a good factual observation.\n*   However, the phrase \"creating a modern and dynamic visual\" is a subjective interpretation. The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" This phrase violates that rule by interpreting the *effect* of the scene's design.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is significantly incomplete and misses several mandatory details requested in the instructions:\n\n*   **Point of View:** It fails to mention the point of view (e.g., a static medium shot from an audience perspective).\n*   **Setting:** While it mentions a \"stage,\" it does not explicitly state that the setting is indoors. It also omits any description of the stage floor itself (e.g., its color or material).\n*   **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene (\"A woman stands\"). It completely omits any description of motion, which is a critical component of a video description. The instructions require describing \"human-made movements\" or even subtle changes.\n*   **Overlays:** The caption does not mention whether there are any overlay elements (text, watermarks, etc.) or confirm their absence.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following ways:\n\n*   **Violation:** It includes the subjective and interpretive phrase \"creating a modern and dynamic visual,\" which goes against the rules to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Omission:** It omits required information about the **point of view**, **motion**, and **overlays**.\n*   **Omission:** It is not as specific as it could be about the **setting** (e.g., explicitly stating \"indoors\").\n*   **Focus:** While it correctly minimizes detail about the subject, its primary failure is describing a static snapshot rather than the motion and flow of a video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman stands on a stage indoors, viewed from a static medium shot from an audience perspective. The stage features a large, vibrant blue backdrop composed of abstract, geometric shapes with sharp angles and intersecting planes. The lighting is focused on the stage, making the blue background appear bright and saturated. The stage floor is dark and appears to be made of wood. The woman occasionally shifts her weight from one foot to the other, and there are no overlay elements such as text or watermarks visible in the video.",
