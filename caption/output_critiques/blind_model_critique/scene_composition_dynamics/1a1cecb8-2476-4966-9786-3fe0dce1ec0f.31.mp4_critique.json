    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a first-person POV, depicts an outdoor urban setting during the day. The scene features a street corner with a pedestrian crossing and a mix of natural and architectural elements. Tall evergreen trees and deciduous trees with budding leaves line the sidewalk, indicating a springtime environment. A stone wall borders the area, and a brick building is visible in the background. The sky is overcast, casting a diffused light over the scene. Traffic signals and street signs are present, adding to the urban atmosphere. The road is paved, with clear markings for pedestrian crossings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and aligns almost perfectly with the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. Every detail mentioned—the first-person POV, the outdoor urban setting at a street corner, the overcast sky, and the specific visual elements like evergreen and budding deciduous trees, a stone wall, a brick building, traffic signals, and paved road markings—is clearly visible in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very thorough. It successfully covers all the key requirements from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"first-person POV.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly described as an \"outdoor urban setting\" at a \"street corner.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Accurately noted as \"during the day\" with an \"overcast\" sky.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Provides good detail on the types of trees, the materials of the wall and building, and the presence of street infrastructure.\n*   **Motion & Overlays:** The caption correctly omits any mention of motion or overlays, as there is no significant movement and no overlays are present in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption demonstrates an outstanding adherence to the stylistic and content rules:\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n*   It successfully combines details from the video into a unified description without referring to specific moments or frames.\n*   The focus remains entirely on the setting and scenery, as instructed.\n*   The statement \"indicating a springtime environment\" is a logical deduction based on the visual evidence of \"budding leaves\" and adds valuable context without being overly speculative. It adheres to the spirit of the instructions by describing what is visually suggested rather than making a baseless guess.",
