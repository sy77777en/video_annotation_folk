    "pre_caption": "A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object, captures a view from the front of a yellow surfboard moving through the ocean. The scene takes place on a sunny day under a blue sky with white clouds. In the background, a city skyline with numerous high-rise buildings lines the coast of Waikiki. The greenish-blue water has white foam and small waves as the board glides forward. Another person on a different surfboard is visible in the water nearby.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective from a yellow surfboard in Waikiki, it misses several key visual details and makes some assumptions. The term 'stable' is likely inaccurate, as the viewpoint probably bobs and sways with the ocean swells, and the description could be improved by noting this motion. The caption also omits the iconic Diamond Head crater, which would almost certainly be visible alongside the city skyline from that location. Furthermore, a common visual element in such videos, water droplets periodically splashing onto the camera lens and temporarily blurring the view, is not mentioned. The description of the water is adequate, but the mention of only 'another person' is an understatement; a typical Waikiki scene would feature numerous other surfers, swimmers, and perhaps even catamarans scattered across the water in the middle and background. Finally, describing the board's movement as simply 'glides forward' is too simplistic; a more accurate description would include the board rising and falling on the small waves and swells.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A dynamic POV shot from a yellow surfboard captures the vibrant scene of surfing through the ocean off Waikiki. The camera, mounted to the board, sways and bobs with the ocean swells, offering a lively perspective. It's a sunny day with a blue sky dotted with white clouds, and the iconic Diamond Head crater is visible alongside the city skyline of high-rise buildings lining the coast. The greenish-blue water is alive with white foam and small waves, and water droplets occasionally splash onto the camera lens, momentarily blurring the view. The surfboard rises and falls with the waves, surrounded by a bustling scene of numerous surfers, swimmers, and catamarans scattered across the water, capturing the essence of a typical day in Waikiki.",
