    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video. It effectively and accurately follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's content.\n*   It correctly identifies the initial scene as a \"dark, blocky, metallic-looking structure submerged in deep blue water\" and notes the \"particulate matter.\"\n*   It accurately describes the transition to a \"wider view\" and the presence of a \"diver in a dark, full-body suit... descending, attached to a thin line.\"\n*   The description of the overlay as a \"small, beige rectangular overlay with the number '1' is present in the bottom left corner\" is precise in its color, shape, content, and placement.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene without unnecessary detail.\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It clearly establishes the underwater setting (\"deep blue water\").\n*   **Notable Elements:** It describes the key structure and the diver, including their appearance and context.\n*   **Motion and Transition:** It successfully captures the dynamic aspects of the video by describing the diver's descent (\"descending\") and the change in perspective (\"The scene then transitions to a wider view\").\n*   **Overlays:** It includes a full description of the persistent overlay element.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption meticulously follows the specific rules outlined in the instructions.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet covers all essential visual information.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The primary focus is on the underwater environment and the objects within it, with the diver described as part of the scene rather than the main subject.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"mysterious,\" \"beautiful\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it seems to be,\" \"perhaps\"). The use of \"metallic-looking\" is appropriate as it describes appearance without making an unverified claim about the material.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It correctly identifies the \"overlay\" and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that logically progresses from the opening shot to the wider view, creating a clear narrative of the video's content.\n*   **No Inference:** The caption refrains from inferring the purpose of the structure, the diver's mission, or the meaning of the scene, sticking strictly to what is visible.",
