    "pre_caption": "From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set within a large, dimly lit indoor space. The environment is dark and cavernous, with a cool, blue-green color cast and soft, hazy light coming from an unseen source above. The background is indistinct, suggesting a hangar or warehouse. In the center of the space, a man wearing a dark beanie and a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch holds a rifle. To his right stands a woman in a light-colored collared jacket.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general atmosphere and character placement, but it lacks the dynamic and specific details expected from a video description. It describes the scene as static, failing to mention the slow, deliberate forward movement of the characters as they scan the vast space, or the subtle, realistic camera sway that grounds the over-the-shoulder perspective. The description of the environment as an \"indistinct\" hangar or warehouse is too vague; the video clearly shows massive, stacked cargo containers with stenciled serial numbers in the background and a network of steel catwalks high above, partially obscured by the atmospheric haze. The caption also omits the polished concrete floor, which creates soft, distorted reflections of the characters and the blue-green overhead lighting. Furthermore, while mentioning the \"G-25\" patch is a good detail, the description of the man's rifle is incomplete, as it neglects to mention the glowing blue energy cell clipped to its side. Finally, the caption completely misses a crucial visual element: a minimalist, translucent white HUD overlay in the lower-right corner displaying an ammo count and a small, circular radar in the upper-left.",
