    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the spectators' attire and the presence of the architectural suite behind them, but it omits several key visual and contextual details. It fails to specify the point of view, which is a medium, slightly low-angle shot that pans slowly from left to right across the fans, making the viewer feel part of the crowd. The description of \"brightly lit\" is ambiguous; the scene takes place at night, illuminated by intense, cool-white stadium floodlights, which cause distinct, sharp reflections on the suite's glass. The caption misses the dynamic motion of the fans, who are not just clapping but also standing and swaying in unison. Furthermore, it neglects to mention a crucial overlay: a semi-transparent sports network logo is consistently visible in the bottom-right corner. While it notes people in the suite are clapping, it fails to capture the contrast in their more reserved demeanor compared to the energetic fans in the foreground. Finally, the \"light-colored frame\" of the windows is more specifically a brushed metallic aluminum.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a nighttime scene illuminated by intense, cool-white stadium floodlights, a medium, slightly low-angle shot pans slowly from left to right, immersing the viewer in a lively crowd of spectators. The fans, dressed in yellow and black attire with yellow beanies and scarves, are standing, clapping, and swaying in unison, creating a dynamic and energetic atmosphere. Behind them, a modern architectural feature showcases a row of large, rectangular glass windows set in a brushed metallic aluminum frame, reflecting sharp, distinct images due to the bright lighting. Through the glass, people in a suite can be seen observing and clapping with a more reserved demeanor compared to the animated fans in the foreground. A semi-transparent sports network logo is consistently visible in the bottom-right corner, adding a broadcast element to the scene.",
