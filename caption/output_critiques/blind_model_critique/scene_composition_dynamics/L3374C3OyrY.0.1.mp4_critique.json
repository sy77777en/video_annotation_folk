    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is very good but has one minor omission. It is accurate, well-written, and follows most of the complex instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key elements: the red soccer cleats, the yellow soccer ball, the green grass, and the falling rain at night. The specific details, such as the wetness, the white Nike swoosh on the cleats, the black swoosh and number \"90\" on the ball, the position of the cleats, and the overhead lighting, are all precise and factually correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is nearly complete. It successfully covers the setting, time of day, weather, and detailed descriptions of the notable objects. However, it is missing one required element:\n\n*   **Point of View:** The instructions state to \"indicate the point of view.\" The caption does not specify the shot type (e.g., a close-up, eye-level shot), which is a key element that influences how the viewer perceives the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to the vast majority of the negative and positive constraints:\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   It provides a concise and informative description.\n    *   It describes the overall scene without referring to specific frames.\n    *   It correctly identifies the setting (outdoors, grassy field), time of day (night), and weather (rain).\n    *   It describes the color, material, texture, and markings of the objects.\n    *   It avoids emotional/subjective adjectives, speculation, and inference.\n    *   It correctly describes motion (\"Rain falls steadily\").\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph in simple, natural English.\n\n*   **What could be improved:**\n    *   The only instruction not followed is the requirement to specify the **point of view**. Adding a phrase like \"From a close-up, eye-level perspective,\" at the beginning would make the caption fully compliant and even more descriptive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. Its only flaw is the omission of the point of view. By adding that single detail, it would be a perfect execution of the prompt.",
