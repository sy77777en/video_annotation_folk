    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective on a moving stretcher, the scene unfolds on a paved road winding through a sun-drenched, rocky landscape. The low angle shows the silver metal rails of the gurney framing the view. Steep, light-colored cliffs with sparse green vegetation rise on both sides of the road, and a bright sun creates a strong lens flare in the sky. On the left, a tall metal gate covered in colorful graffiti stands beside the road. A figure in a large bird costume pushes the stretcher from behind, with the legs and torso of an injured person in a hospital gown visible in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **very good** and adheres to the vast majority of the instructions. It successfully creates a clear, objective, and comprehensive description of the scene. However, there is one minor but specific violation.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a cohesive and specific scene. All the elements mentioned—the first-person view from a stretcher, the rocky landscape, the sun flare, the graffiti-covered gate, the bird costume, and the person on the gurney—fit together to form a plausible, albeit unusual, scenario.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is highly complete. It successfully incorporates all the required elements:\n    *   **Point of View:** Correctly identifies the \"first-person perspective on a moving stretcher\" and its effect (\"low angle,\" \"framing the view\").\n    *   **Setting & Environment:** Clearly describes the \"paved road winding through a sun-drenched, rocky landscape\" with \"steep, light-colored cliffs.\"\n    *   **Time of Day & Visuals:** Mentions it is \"sun-drenched\" and includes the \"strong lens flare.\"\n    *   **Notable Elements:** Details the \"silver metal rails,\" the \"tall metal gate covered in colorful graffiti,\" and the subjects.\n    *   **Motion:** Implies motion with \"moving stretcher\" and \"pushes the stretcher.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives.\n    *   It correctly identifies and describes key visual elements with details on color, material, and markings (e.g., \"silver metal rails,\" \"colorful graffiti\").\n    *   It avoids speculative language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   It correctly places the subjects within the scene (\"pushes... from behind,\" \"visible in the foreground\") without excessive detail.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement (Violation):**\n    *   The caption violates the rule: **\"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"**\n    *   The phrase **\"injured person\"** is an inference. While a person in a hospital gown on a stretcher is likely injured, their specific condition is not visually confirmed. The instruction requires describing only what is visible. A more compliant description would be \"a person in a hospital gown.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and well-structured. The only flaw is the use of the word \"injured,\" which is an assumption. By changing \"injured person\" to \"a person,\" the caption would be in perfect compliance with all given rules.",
