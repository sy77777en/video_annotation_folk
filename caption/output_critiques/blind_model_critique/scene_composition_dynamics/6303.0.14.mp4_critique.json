    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set in a vibrant barbershop. The environment is indoors, featuring a checkered black-and-white floor and walls adorned with mirrors and shelves. Neon lights in warm tones add a colorful glow to the scene. The setting is lively, with a focus on a person in a bright red sweater standing in front of the viewer. The person’s expression changes, indicating interaction. The viewer's hands are visible, holding a comb and scissors, suggesting a haircut in progress. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and engaging, with a clear focus on the barbershop's bustling activity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it correctly identifies some key elements of the scene, it violates several core rules outlined in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the criteria:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption appears to be factually accurate in its description of the visual elements (first-person POV, barbershop, checkered floor, neon lights, red sweater, comb and scissors). It correctly identifies the setting and key objects.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption successfully includes the point of view, setting (indoors), and notable visual elements like the floor, lights, and props (comb, scissors).\n*   It mentions motion by describing the person's changing expression.\n*   It fails to mention the time of day, which could be inferred from the neon lights but is not explicitly stated.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It breaks the following rules:\n\n*   **Rule Violated:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Caption:** Uses \"vibrant,\" \"lively,\" \"dynamic,\" and \"engaging.\" These words describe a feeling or atmosphere rather than objective visual information.\n\n*   **Rule Violated:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Caption:** States \"...with a focus on a person in a bright red sweater...\" and \"...with a clear focus on the barbershop's bustling activity.\" This explains the compositional intent, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Rule Violated:** \"Avoid speculative statements... Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   **Caption:** States the person's expression change is \"indicating interaction,\" the visible hands are \"suggesting a haircut in progress,\" and the atmosphere is one of \"bustling activity.\" These are all interpretations of what is happening, not direct descriptions of what is visible.\n\n*   **Rule Violated:** \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n    *   **Caption:** Starts with \"The video presents...\" which is an unnecessary introductory phrase. The description should begin directly with the scene's details.\n\n### Corrected Example Following All Instructions:\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, the scene is set indoors within a barbershop. The floor has a black-and-white checkered pattern, and the walls are lined with mirrors and shelves holding various items. Warm-toned neon lights illuminate the space. A person wearing a red sweater stands in front of the viewpoint, and their facial expression changes. The hands of the viewpoint character are visible, holding a comb and a pair of scissors.",
