    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an outdoor setting at sunset, featuring a quiet rural scene with a road and railway track running parallel. The environment includes a few brick buildings with simple, angular shapes and dark roofs, positioned on either side of the road. The sky is filled with soft, warm hues of orange and yellow, with scattered clouds partially obscuring the sun as it sets on the horizon. Trees with sparse foliage are visible, adding to the tranquil atmosphere. The lighting casts long shadows, enhancing the textures of the road and buildings. Overlay elements include text or visuals, such as titles or captions, placed unobtrusively within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the scene's general mood and key elements, but it fails to meet several critical requirements of the instructions, particularly regarding specificity, objectivity, and the description of overlay elements.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the outdoor setting, time of day (sunset), rural environment, parallel road and railway track, building characteristics (brick, angular, dark roofs), and sky (warm hues, scattered clouds) is accurate.\n*   **Inaccurate/Vague:** The description of the overlay is highly inaccurate. It vaguely states \"text or visuals, such as titles or captions,\" which is speculative. The video clearly shows a specific text credit within a white box, not ambiguous \"visuals\" or \"titles.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption is missing several key details mandated by the instructions.\n    *   **Point of View:** It fails to mention that the video is from a static, eye-level point of view.\n    *   **Motion:** It does not state that the scene is static, with no discernible motion, which is a notable characteristic of the video.\n    *   **Overlay Details:** This is the most significant omission. The caption fails to describe the overlay's specific content (\"Video by Cottonbro Studio from Pexels\"), its appearance (white text inside a white rectangular box), and its precise placement (lower-left corner).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Failed to Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses \"quiet rural scene\" and \"tranquil atmosphere.\" While visually still, \"quiet\" is an inference about sound, and \"tranquil\" is an emotional, subjective adjective, which the instructions forbid.\n*   **Failed to Avoid Explaining Emphasis:** The phrase \"enhancing the textures of the road and buildings\" explains the *effect* of the lighting, which violates the rule: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n*   **Failed to Avoid Speculative Statements:** The description of the overlay as \"text or visuals, such as titles or captions\" is a direct violation of the rule: \"Avoid speculative statements... or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n*   **Failed to Describe Overlays Correctly:** The instructions require a description of an overlay's \"content and placement.\" The caption provides a generic, placeholder description instead of the specific details visible in the video.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures the general essence of the scene, it is not a \"good\" caption according to the provided rules. It lacks the required specificity for overlays, includes forbidden subjective and interpretive language, and omits key information about the point of view and lack of motion.",
