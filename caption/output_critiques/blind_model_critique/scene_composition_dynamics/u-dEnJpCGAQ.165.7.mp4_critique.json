    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a savanna landscape during daylight. The scene features a group of elephants standing amidst tall, dry grass. The elephants, with their textured gray skin and large ears, are positioned in a natural formation, some facing the camera while others are turned away. Sparse trees and distant hills form the backdrop, adding depth to the environment. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the natural elements and wildlife harmoniously integrated into the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview of the scene but lacks the specificity and objectivity required by the instructions. While it correctly identifies the savanna setting and the presence of elephants, it misses several key visual details. The point of view is not mentioned; the video is a static, ground-level shot. The term \"daylight\" is too general; the long shadows cast by the elephants and scattered acacia trees indicate it is late afternoon. The description of the elephants as \"standing\" is inaccurate, as there is subtle motion: one elephant flaps its large ears, another sprays reddish-brown dust over its back, and a small calf is partially visible beside its mother. The caption also omits that the \"tall, dry grass\" is a distinct golden-yellow color and rustles in a light breeze. Furthermore, it uses subjective and emotional adjectives like \"serene\" and \"calm,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions. Finally, the caption fails to note the semi-transparent watermark for a nature channel located in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Incorporating these details would create a more precise and comprehensive description of the video's content.",
