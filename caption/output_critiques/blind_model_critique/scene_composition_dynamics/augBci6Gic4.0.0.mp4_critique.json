    "pre_caption": "The video is set indoors within a completely dark space, possibly a studio or stage. A single spotlight shines down from above, creating a distinct circle of light on the dark floor. Inside this illuminated area, a white chalk outline resembling the shape of a body is visible on the floor. A simple wooden stool is placed centrally within the chalk outline. A person sits on the stool, facing forward, largely obscured in silhouette due to the strong backlighting from the spotlight. Hints of color and pattern are visible on the person's shirt, contrasted with dark pants. Their hands rest on their knees with palms facing upwards. The surrounding environment outside the spotlight remains in deep shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of object placement is slightly confusing; stating the chalk outline is \"in front of a simple wooden stool, at the middle bottom of the frame\" makes the spatial relationship unclear. In the video, the chalk outline is clearly on the floor between the viewer and the stool. The caption also contains a contradiction, saying the person is \"in front of\" the stool while also sitting \"on the stool.\" The description is too static for a video; it omits the subtle motion of the person's chest rising and falling with each breath and the slight, nervous twitch in their fingers. Furthermore, the details are too generic. The \"dark floor\" is actually a polished black concrete surface that creates a faint, distorted reflection of the light. The \"simple wooden stool\" is a specific backless, four-legged artist's stool made of dark, weathered oak. The \"hints of color\" on the shirt are a discernible faded red and grey plaid pattern, visible where the light catches the fabric on the shoulders. The caption also fails to mention the visible beam of the spotlight, which cuts through a light haze in the air, illuminating swirling dust motes and adding texture to the darkness. Finally, it should specify that the point of view is a static, eye-level shot that performs a very slow, almost imperceptible push-in, gradually tightening the focus on the silhouetted figure.",
