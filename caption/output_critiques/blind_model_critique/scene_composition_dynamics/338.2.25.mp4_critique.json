    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor restaurant setting with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The environment features several tables with white tablecloths, occupied by patrons enjoying their meals. The walls are adorned with large, intricate artworks that add a cultural touch to the space. The lighting is soft, creating a cozy ambiance. The carpeted floor complements the overall decor, enhancing the restaurant's traditional style. Notable visual elements include a man at a table, engaged in an animated manner with his meal, adding a dynamic aspect to the otherwise calm setting. The scene captures a lively yet relaxed dining experience, with people conversing and enjoying their food.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several core requirements, particularly the negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nWithout access to the video, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the described elements (e.g., restaurant setting, white tablecloths, artworks, carpeted floor). The feedback below assumes these visual elements are present in the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete as it omits several key details required by the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It does not specify the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld).\n*   **Time of Day:** It fails to mention the time of day.\n*   **Specific Details:** It describes the artworks as \"large, intricate\" but does not provide objective details about their color, material, or subject matter as instructed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates multiple explicit instructions, making it unsuitable.\n\n*   **Violation: Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.**\n    The caption is filled with subjective language that describes a feeling rather than the scene itself.\n    *   **Examples:** \"warm, inviting atmosphere,\" \"cozy ambiance,\" \"lively yet relaxed dining experience.\"\n\n*   **Violation: Do not infer the role of the scene setting or explain what the scene emphasizes.**\n    The caption repeatedly interprets the purpose of elements and summarizes the overall mood, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...artworks that **add a cultural touch to the space**,\" \"...carpeted floor **complements the overall decor, enhancing the restaurant's traditional style**,\" \"...man...**adding a dynamic aspect to the otherwise calm setting**,\" \"The scene **captures a lively yet relaxed dining experience**.\"\n\n*   **Violation: Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions.**\n    The caption shifts focus to the experience and actions of the patrons instead of maintaining a neutral, setting-focused description.\n    *   **Examples:** \"...patrons **enjoying their meals**,\" \"...man...**engaged in an animated manner**,\" \"...people **conversing and enjoying their food**.\" These are interpretations of behavior and emotion, not objective descriptions.\n\n*   **Violation: Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph.**\n    While the English is natural, the description is not concise because it includes interpretive and atmospheric phrases that add length without providing objective information as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption reads more like a promotional description or a review than the objective, factual summary demanded by the instructions. It focuses on the mood, atmosphere, and the inferred experience of the subjects, all of which were explicitly prohibited.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a restaurant interior with several tables covered in white tablecloths. Patrons are seated at these tables, eating their meals. The walls display large artworks, though their colors and subjects are not specified. The lighting is soft, and the floor is carpeted. A man is visible at one table, actively eating. The camera perspective is not specified, and the time of day is not mentioned.",
