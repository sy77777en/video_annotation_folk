    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting with dim, moody lighting, creating a shadowy atmosphere. The environment appears to be a confined space, possibly a room with dark walls. The time of day is indeterminate due to the low light, but the scene suggests an evening or nighttime setting. Notable visual elements include a person holding an object, possibly food, with a focused expression. The person is wearing a dark leather jacket, adding to the subdued color palette. The lighting casts soft shadows, highlighting the texture of the jacket and the person's features. The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet introspection within a confined, dimly lit space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It violates several core rules of the prompt.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   As I cannot see the video, I cannot assess the factual accuracy of the description (e.g., whether the jacket is actually leather or if the lighting is dim). My feedback is based solely on how the caption adheres to the writing instructions.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption fails to mention the point of view (e.g., first-person, static shot, handheld), which is a required element.\n*   **Vague Setting:** The description of the environment is too general (\"a confined space,\" \"a room with dark walls\"). The instructions ask for defining features, but the caption offers none.\n*   **Missing Motion/Transitions:** The caption describes a static scene. If there is any movement, change in lighting, or scene transition in the video, it has been omitted.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several negative constraints, which are the most critical part of the instructions.\n\n*   **Violation: Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements like 'it appears' or 'possibly'. The caption uses them multiple times:\n    *   \"...**appears to be** a confined space...\"\n    *   \"...**possibly** a room...\"\n    *   \"...the scene **suggests** an evening or nighttime setting.\"\n    *   \"...holding an object, **possibly** food...\"\n\n*   **Violation: Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state to avoid emotional or subjective words. The caption includes several:\n    *   \"...dim, **moody** lighting...\"\n    *   \"...a **focused** expression.\"\n    *   \"...conveys a sense of quiet **introspection**...\"\n\n*   **Violation: Explaining Emphasis or Effect:** The instructions prohibit explaining what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The caption does this repeatedly:\n    *   \"...**creating a shadowy atmosphere**.\" (Explains the effect of the lighting).\n    *   \"...**adding to the subdued color palette**.\" (Explains the effect of the jacket).\n    *   \"...**highlighting the texture** of the jacket...\" (Explains the effect of the shadows).\n\n*   **Violation: Inferring Information:** The final sentence, \"The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet introspection...,\" is a complete inference of mood and feeling, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\nIn summary, the caption is written as a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood rather than the objective, factual description required by the instructions. It relies heavily on speculation, emotional language, and explaining the \"why\" behind visual elements instead of simply describing the \"what.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor setting with low lighting, creating shadows. The camera is positioned at eye level, capturing a static shot. The environment is a small room with dark walls. A person is in the frame, holding an object that resembles food. They are wearing a dark jacket. The lighting casts shadows on the jacket and the person's face. There is no visible movement or transition in the scene.",
