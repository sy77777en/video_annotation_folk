    "pre_caption": "The video is set outdoors on a stone-paved area, likely a balcony or rampart of an old stone structure in Edinburgh, characterized by rough-hewn, grey and brown stone walls. A simple black metal railing lines part of the area. In the background, a panoramic view of the city unfolds under an overcast sky, featuring a mix of buildings, prominent spires, Calton Hill with its monuments, and the Firth of Forth in the distance. A person wearing a red t-shirt and a multi-colored helmet rides an orange and black bicycle, moving across the scene from left to right between stone pillars, which progressively reveals more of the city view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the location and general setting, but it understates the point of view and the nature of the central action. The video is not just a passive observation; it's a dynamic, low-angle tracking shot that follows the cyclist, making the viewer feel present and close to the action. The description of the person simply \"riding\" the bicycle is a significant misrepresentation; the video clearly shows a trials cyclist performing a technical stunt, balancing precariously on the edge of the stone wall and hopping the orange and black trials bike between the pillars, not just riding across a paved area. The caption also misses the texture of the ground, which is not just \"stone-paved\" but consists of uneven, weathered cobblestones that the cyclist navigates with precision. Furthermore, the \"multi-colored helmet\" is more specifically a white helmet with prominent red and blue graphics. The final camera movement is not just \"upward\" but a smooth, deliberate tilt that dramatically reveals the full expanse of the Edinburgh cityscape as the cyclist completes their line, creating a sense of accomplishment. Lastly, the caption omits a small, semi-transparent watermark in the bottom-right corner for a cycling brand.",
