The octagonal tower shows signs of disrepair, featuring boarded-up windows and broken sections of masonry. At its peak is a dark, caged lantern room. Behind the structure, the sky is a gloomy expanse of swirling green and gray clouds as the view slowly tilts upward along the height of the dilapidated tower.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's content.\n*   **Lighthouse:** It correctly identifies the lighthouse as \"weathered, light-gray,\" \"octagonal,\" and in \"disrepair,\" noting the \"boarded-up windows,\" \"broken sections of masonry,\" and \"dark, caged lantern room.\"\n*   **Environment:** The description of a \"dark, turbulent sky,\" \"heavy downpour,\" and \"swirling green and gray clouds\" perfectly captures the stormy atmosphere.\n*   **Motion:** It accurately describes the camera movement as a view that \"slowly tilts upward along the height of the dilapidated tower.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene without being overly detailed.\n*   **Key Elements:** It includes all the essential information: the point of view (upward tilt), the setting (a stormy location with a lighthouse), the time of day (implied dark daytime due to the storm), and notable visual elements (the specific features of the lighthouse and sky).\n*   **Weather and Motion:** It effectively incorporates the weather (\"heavy downpour\") and natural motion (\"swirling... clouds\") alongside the camera motion.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption meticulously follows every rule outlined in the instructions.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, using words like \"turbulent,\" \"weathered,\" and \"gloomy\" to describe visual characteristics rather than to evoke a feeling.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description centers on the setting and the lighthouse as a feature within it, rather than treating it as a character or subject with a story.\n*   **No Speculation:** It describes only what is visible, avoiding any assumptions or ambiguous terms.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not infer the purpose of the setting.\n*   **Motion Description:** The camera's upward tilt is described naturally as part of the scene's progression.",
