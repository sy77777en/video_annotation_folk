    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting within a large hangar-like structure, featuring a massive aircraft partially enclosed by the building. The environment is industrial, with metal beams and bright overhead lights illuminating the scene. The aircraft, with its metallic surface and large windows, dominates the space, while smoke or mist envelops parts of it, creating a dynamic atmosphere. Cargo containers with labels and markings are positioned nearby, adding to the industrial feel. The scene is characterized by a warm color palette, with the lighting casting a yellowish hue over the area. The setting suggests a bustling, mechanical environment, with the aircraft and containers as central elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main event and setting, but it lacks the sense of motion and specific detail that would be present in the video. It describes the scene as a static event (\"depicts an aircraft crashing\") rather than an ongoing action; it should convey the continuous movement of sparks showering from the point of impact, dust and debris actively falling from the buckled ceiling, and thick smoke billowing from the damaged aircraft. The point of view is omitted but would be crucial for context; specifying a fixed, third-person perspective would clarify the framing of the large-scale destruction. The description of the \"two unidentified labeled objects\" is too vague; they could be more precisely described as, for example, \"two large, yellow industrial generators with black hazard symbols.\" Furthermore, the phrase \"causing it to collapse\" is a conclusive statement that may not be fully realized in the shot; it would be more accurate to describe what is visibly happening, such as \"the structure groans and metal beams begin to twist and fall.\" Finally, the caption uses subjective phrasing like \"creating a dynamic atmosphere,\" which should be replaced by describing the visual elements that create that effect, such as the chaotic interplay of flickering overhead lights, falling debris, and roiling smoke.",
