    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dimly lit bedroom at night. A person, whose features are obscured in shadow, lies in bed while holding up a smartphone. The bright screen of the phone, which displays a photograph of a face, serves as the primary light source. In the softly blurred background, a shelf is cluttered with numerous indistinct, colorful objects, punctuated by warm, out-of-focus points of light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the setting and primary action, but it misses the crucial first-person point of view, which fundamentally shapes the experience. Describing it as \"A person... lies in bed\" suggests an external observer, whereas the video is shot from the perspective of the person holding the phone, making the viewer the subject. The phrase \"capturing subtle movements\" is too vague; the caption should specify what the camera is aimed at—for instance, a dark corner of the ceiling where a shadow flickers—and describe the nature of the movement. Furthermore, the description of the smartphone screen is incomplete. It fails to mention the overlay of the camera app's user interface, such as a red, blinking recording icon in the top left corner and a digital timestamp counting seconds in the bottom right, which are prominent visual elements. The caption also neglects to describe the motion of the camera itself; the slight, unsteady tremor of the handheld phone is constant throughout, adding a layer of realism and tension that is absent from the description. While the background is correctly identified as blurred, specifying the shapes as \"the soft-focus silhouettes of books and a small, potted plant\" would provide more definitive context than \"indistinct, colorful objects.\"",
