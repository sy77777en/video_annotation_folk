    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor setting, likely a dimly lit diner or bar, characterized by warm, ambient lighting with red and yellow hues. The environment features a counter with typical diner elements like condiment bottles. The walls are adorned with retro-style decor, including a prominent logo or sign. The atmosphere suggests a casual, relaxed vibe, with the lighting creating a cozy, intimate feel. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining its focus on the interior's nostalgic and inviting ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor, dimly lit setting and its warm color palette, but it relies on speculation (\"likely a diner or bar\") when the video clearly establishes the environment as a classic diner. It completely misses the first-person point of view, which is essential as it places the viewer sitting at the polished wooden counter, looking over a half-full soda glass. The description of \"retro-style decor\" is too vague; the video shows specific details like black-and-white checkerboard wall tiles and framed photographs of old cars. The \"prominent logo or sign\" is more accurately described as a red neon sign spelling \"EAT.\" The caption incorrectly states the scene is consistent and static, failing to mention the slow panning motion from right to left that reveals a chrome napkin dispenser and a glass sugar shaker next to the condiment bottles. Furthermore, it violates the instructions by using subjective and emotional adjectives like \"casual,\" \"cozy,\" and \"nostalgic\" instead of focusing on objective visual facts. Finally, the caption omits a semi-transparent text overlay—a username watermark—located in the bottom right corner.",
