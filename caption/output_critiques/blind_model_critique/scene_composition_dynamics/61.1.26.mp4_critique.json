    "pre_caption": "The video captures an indoor setting, likely a dimly lit diner or bar, characterized by warm, ambient lighting with red and yellow hues. The environment features a counter with typical diner elements like condiment bottles. The walls are adorned with retro-style decor, including a prominent logo or sign. The atmosphere suggests a casual, relaxed vibe, with the lighting creating a cozy, intimate feel. The scene remains consistent throughout, maintaining its focus on the interior's nostalgic and inviting ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. It fails to adhere to several key negative constraints, particularly regarding speculation, subjective language, and inference.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is unsuccessful:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the video does show an indoor location with red/yellow light, a counter, and a logo, the factual descriptions are likely accurate. However, the classification of the location as a \"diner or bar\" is presented as a guess, which violates the instructions.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Point of View:** The caption does not mention the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, first-person), which is a required element if relevant.\n*   **Motion:** It correctly notes that the scene is consistent, which addresses the aspect of motion (or lack thereof).\n*   **Overlays:** It does not mention if there are any overlays like text or watermarks. If the video has none, this is fine, but if it does, it's an omission.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates multiple core rules from the instructions:\n\n1.  **Violation: Avoid speculative statements.**\n    *   The caption says, \"**likely** a dimly lit diner or bar...\" and \"**The atmosphere suggests** a casual, relaxed vibe...\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative words like \"likely\" and \"suggests.\"\n\n2.  **Violation: Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.**\n    *   The caption is filled with subjective and emotional language, such as \"**warm**, ambient lighting,\" \"**casual, relaxed** vibe,\" \"**cozy, intimate** feel,\" and \"**nostalgic and inviting** ambiance.\" The instructions require objective descriptions.\n\n3.  **Violation: Do not infer the role of the scene setting.**\n    *   The phrase \"**typical diner elements**\" infers the function and category of the objects and the setting itself, rather than just describing them objectively (e.g., \"a counter holding condiment bottles\").\n\n4.  **Violation: Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.**\n    *   The caption states, \"...with the lighting **creating a cozy, intimate feel**\" and \"...maintaining its **focus on the interior's nostalgic and inviting ambiance**.\" These phrases interpret the artistic intent and emotional impact, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Summary\nThe caption attempts to describe the scene but relies heavily on interpretation, emotion, and speculation instead of the objective, factual description required by the instructions. It correctly identifies some visual elements but frames them within a subjective context, making it a poor fit for the provided guidelines.",
