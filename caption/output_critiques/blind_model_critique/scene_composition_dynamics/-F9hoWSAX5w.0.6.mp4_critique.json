    "pre_caption": "The video shows an outdoor basketball court on an overcast day, viewed from behind a black chain-link fence with an open gate in the center. The court surface is wet, painted green and red with white lines, and has visible puddles. An orange cone sits near the center of the court. Two basketball hoops are present, one on each side. The foreground shows brown fallen leaves. In the background, bare trees line the perimeter of a park area, with a taller building visible in the distance and a brick building to the right of the court.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the detailed instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It provides specific, verifiable details that are logically organized. For example, it correctly identifies the \"black chain-link fence,\" the \"green and red\" court with \"white lines,\" the presence of \"puddles,\" an \"orange cone,\" and background elements like \"bare trees\" and a \"brick building.\" The description flows logically from the foreground and point of view to the main subject and then to the background.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions for a static scene:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"viewed from behind a black chain-link fence.\"\n*   **Setting:** Identified as an \"outdoor basketball court\" in a \"park area.\"\n*   **Time of Day & Weather:** Described as an \"overcast day,\" which is supported by details like the \"wet\" court and \"puddles.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It meticulously describes the fence, the court surface (color, condition, markings), the cone, the hoops, the leaves in the foreground, and the buildings and trees in the background.\n\nThe caption correctly omits any mention of motion, subjects, or scene transitions, which implies the video is a single, static shot of an empty court.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption demonstrates outstanding adherence to the rules:\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective English, avoiding emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It strictly avoids speculation (like \"it appears\" or \"might be\") and does not infer the purpose or mood of the scene.\n*   It focuses on the setting and scenery rather than on a primary subject.\n*   The opening phrase \"The video shows\" is acceptable, but for future reference, a more direct description like \"Viewed from behind a black chain-link fence, an outdoor basketball court is visible on an overcast day...\" can feel more immediate and is also a valid interpretation of the instructions. However, this is a minor stylistic point, and the current phrasing is perfectly clear.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt. It is descriptive, objective, and well-structured.",
