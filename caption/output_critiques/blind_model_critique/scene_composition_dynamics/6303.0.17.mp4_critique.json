    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a vibrant, eclectic room with a checkered black-and-white floor and walls featuring a geometric pattern. The setting is illuminated by colorful neon lights, casting a dynamic glow throughout the space. A large circular mirror and various electronic equipment are visible, contributing to a lively, energetic atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. The scene includes a person in a bright red outfit, adding a striking contrast to the surroundings. The environment is filled with movement and energy, with the person actively engaging with the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the indoor setting, the black-and-white checkered floor, and the presence of a person in a red outfit. However, it lacks specificity and includes subjective language contrary to the instructions. The description of \"various electronic equipment\" is too vague; it should specify the visible DJ turntables and a stack of old CRT monitors displaying static patterns to the side of the room. The caption fails to mention the point of view, which is a crucial element; the video is filmed from a dynamic, moving handheld perspective that circles the subject and pans across the room's features. It also omits the persistent overlay of a social media handle watermark in the bottom-right corner. While it mentions \"colorful neon lights,\" it could be more precise by stating they are primarily pink and blue tube lights that flicker intermittently. Finally, the caption uses prohibited subjective adjectives like \"vibrant,\" \"eclectic,\" \"lively,\" and \"energetic,\" and it infers an \"atmosphere\" instead of sticking to objective descriptions of the visual elements.",
