    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a vibrant, eclectic room with a checkered black-and-white floor and walls featuring a geometric pattern. The setting is illuminated by colorful neon lights, casting a dynamic glow throughout the space. A large circular mirror and various electronic equipment are visible, contributing to a lively, energetic atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. The scene includes a person in a bright red outfit, adding a striking contrast to the surroundings.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at describing the scene, but it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description (an indoor room with a checkered floor, neon lights, a mirror, and a person in red), the factual elements of the caption are accurate.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **What it includes:** The caption successfully identifies the setting (indoors), time of day (indeterminate), and notable visual elements (floor, walls, lights, mirror, person).\n*   **What it's missing:** It does not mention the **point of view** (e.g., static shot, handheld, first-person), which is a required element. The description of motion (\"filled with movement and energy,\" \"actively engaging\") is vague and could be more specific (e.g., \"the person dances,\" \"the lights flash\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several explicit rules from the instructions:\n\n1.  **Use of Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses several:\n    *   \"**vibrant**, **eclectic** room\"\n    *   \"**dynamic** glow\"\n    *   \"**lively**, **energetic** atmosphere\"\n    *   \"**striking** contrast\"\n    These words describe feelings or interpretations rather than objective facts.\n\n2.  **Explaining Emphasis or Effect:** The instructions state, \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" The caption does this twice:\n    *   \"...**contributing to a lively, energetic atmosphere.**\" This explains the *effect* of the mirror and equipment.\n    *   \"...**adding a striking contrast to the surroundings.**\" This explains the visual *effect* of the person's red outfit.\n\n3.  **Vague Descriptions:** The instruction asks for a clear and concise description. The phrase \"**actively engaging with the space**\" is ambiguous and interpretive. A better description would state the action itself (e.g., \"a person walks through the room,\" \"a person dances\").\n\n### Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   Correctly identifies the indoor setting and indeterminate time of day.\n*   Describes key physical objects and their features (checkered floor, circular mirror).\n*   Follows the single-paragraph format.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   Fails to avoid subjective and emotional language as instructed.\n*   Explains the \"why\" or the \"effect\" of visual elements, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   Lacks key information like the point of view and uses vague language to describe motion.\n\nIn conclusion, the caption is not good because it repeatedly violates the core negative constraints of the instructions, particularly regarding the use of subjective language and the explanation of visual effects. A good caption would be more objective and literal, simply stating what is visible without interpretation.",
