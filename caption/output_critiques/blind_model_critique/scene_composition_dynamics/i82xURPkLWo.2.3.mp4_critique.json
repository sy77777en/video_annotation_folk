    "pre_caption": "The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body in an indoor setting. The environment is a grand, ornate building with classical architectural elements, including decorative columns and intricate moldings. The walls are adorned with detailed carvings and a mix of soft, muted colors like beige and cream. The setting appears to be well-lit, suggesting daytime, with natural light filtering through unseen windows. The floor is scattered with debris, adding a slightly neglected feel to the otherwise elegant surroundings. The scene captures a sense of historical grandeur with its elaborate design and spacious layout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption.\n\n### **Evaluation of the Caption**\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions. It successfully identifies the setting and some visual elements but includes subjective language, speculation, and interpretations that were explicitly forbidden.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Feedback**\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of an ornate, classical building with debris seems plausible.\n*   **Inaccurate/Confusing Terminology:** The phrase **\"third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot\"** is contradictory. An \"over-the-shoulder\" shot is a type of third-person perspective. A \"Point of View (POV)\" shot implies a first-person perspective. The caption should simply state it is a third-person, over-the-shoulder shot.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   **Partially Complete:** The caption covers the point of view, setting (indoors), environment (ornate building), and some visual details (columns, moldings, debris).\n*   **Missing Information:**\n    *   **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene. It does not mention if the character, camera, or any environmental elements are in motion.\n    *   **Material/Texture:** While it mentions \"carvings\" and \"moldings,\" it does not describe their material (e.g., stone, plaster, wood). It mentions \"debris\" but not what it consists of (e.g., paper, rubble, dust).\n    *   **Overlays:** It does not mention the presence or absence of any overlay elements like text or watermarks.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions**\n\nThis is the area with the most significant issues. The caption violates multiple negative constraints.\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Introductory/Concluding Text:** The caption begins with **\"The video presents...\"** and ends with **\"The scene captures a sense of...\"**. The instructions require returning only the one-paragraph description without such framing.\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses several subjective words:\n    *   **\"grand,\" \"ornate,\" \"elegant,\" \"elaborate\"**: These are interpretive and not objective descriptions.\n    *   **\"soft, muted colors\"**: \"Soft\" and \"muted\" are subjective interpretations of the color palette.\n    *   **\"historical grandeur\"**: This is a purely subjective and interpretive phrase.\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption uses the phrase **\"appears to be well-lit,\"** which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction to avoid terms like \"it appears.\"\n*   **VIOLATION - Avoid Describing Anything Not Visible:** The caption mentions **\"natural light filtering through unseen windows.\"** If the windows are unseen, they should not be described. One can state there is natural light without speculating on its source.\n*   **VIOLATION - Do Not Infer or Explain Emphasis:** The caption infers meaning and feeling with phrases like **\"adding a slightly neglected feel\"** and **\"The scene captures a sense of historical grandeur.\"** The instructions explicitly state not to explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised Caption Example**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions for the same scene:\n\nFrom a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective, a character's upper body is visible within a large, indoor space. The building features classical architecture, with decorative columns, intricate moldings, and detailed carvings on the beige and cream walls. The area is brightly lit by a source of natural light, indicating daytime, and debris is scattered across the floor.",
