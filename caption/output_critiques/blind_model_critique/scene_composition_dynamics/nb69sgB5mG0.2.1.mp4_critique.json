    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors at a swimming facility, featuring a diving platform and a pool. The setting includes a diving board with metal railings and a spectator area with tiered seating. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an artificial lighting setup typical of indoor sports venues. The pool water is a vibrant blue, with ripples and splashes indicating movement. The scene transitions from a diver standing poised on the platform to the water's surface, where a splash marks the entry. The overall atmosphere is focused on the diving activity, with the pool's reflective surface and the structured seating area providing context.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it violates several key negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding speculative language and analysis.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Setting and Environment:** It correctly identifies the scene as an indoor swimming facility and describes key elements like the diving platform, pool, and spectator seating.\n*   **Motion and Transitions:** It successfully describes the motion of the water (ripples, splashes) and the transition from the diver on the platform to the splash in the water.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is written as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Notable Visuals:** It mentions the color of the water (blue) and the material of the railings (metal).\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"**suggesting** an artificial lighting setup\" is speculative. The instruction is to describe what is visible, not to suggest or infer the cause. It should simply state that the scene is artificially lit.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\":** The phrase \"**typical of indoor sports venues**\" infers the role and type of the location beyond simple description. This is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":** The final sentence, \"The overall **atmosphere is focused on** the diving activity, with the pool's reflective surface and the structured seating area **providing context**,\" is pure analysis. It explains the purpose and focus of the scene, which the instructions strictly prohibit.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The word \"**vibrant**\" to describe the blue water is a subjective adjective. A more neutral term like \"bright blue\" or simply \"blue\" would be better.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Missing Point of View (POV):** The caption completely omits the point of view. It does not specify if this is a static wide shot, a handheld camera, a low-angle shot, or any other camera perspective, which is a required element.\n*   **Missing Details on Visual Elements:** While it mentions \"metal railings,\" it could be more descriptive about other elements as per the instructions (e.g., the material of the diving platform surface, the color/material of the tiered seating, the texture of the walls).\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   The description is generally accurate based on the content it describes (a diving scene). However, it uses \"diving platform\" and \"diving board\" interchangeably, which could be an inaccuracy depending on the specific equipment shown. Precision is important.\n\nIn summary, the caption starts with a decent descriptive foundation but fails significantly by including speculative, inferential, and analytical statements. It also misses a key required component (the point of view), making it an incomplete and poorly executed response to the detailed instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is set indoors at a swimming facility, featuring a diving platform and a pool. The scene includes a diving board with metal railings and a spectator area with tiered seating. The environment is brightly lit with artificial lighting. The pool water is blue, with ripples and splashes indicating movement. The camera captures a diver standing poised on the platform, transitioning to the water's surface where a splash marks the entry. The point of view is a wide shot, showing the reflective pool surface and the structured seating area. The diving platform appears to be made of a textured material, and the tiered seating is composed of plastic seats.",
