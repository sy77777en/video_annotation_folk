    "pre_caption": "Shot from a low angle, the scene unfolds on a vast, paved expanse under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with distant mountains on the horizon. In the immediate foreground, a ramp made of white pipe leads up to a small platform topped with green artificial turf. A central wooden post supports a white string that is initially taut before it snaps loose and flies through the air. To the left stands a large, A-frame wooden structure with blue-painted elements, and to the right is a large rectangular backdrop, colored blue and orange, with a small red flag at its peak.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully adheres to all the specified guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It describes specific objects (ramp, post, A-frame structure, backdrop), their materials (pipe, wood, artificial turf), colors (white, green, blue, orange, red), and shapes (A-frame, rectangular) with precision.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Point of View:** The caption correctly identifies the \"low angle\" shot.\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It establishes a clear outdoor setting (\"vast, paved expanse\") with specific environmental details (\"bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, with distant mountains on the horizon\").\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It thoroughly describes the key objects in the scene, including their placement (\"immediate foreground,\" \"central,\" \"to the left,\" \"to the right\"), which helps build a comprehensive mental image.\n*   **Motion:** The caption effectively captures the main action within the scene by describing the string as \"initially taut before it snaps loose and flies through the air.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that conveys a large amount of visual information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly prioritizes the setting and notable objects over any potential subjects, as instructed.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"dramatic\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\"). It uses descriptive but neutral words like \"vast,\" \"bright,\" and \"fluffy.\"\n*   **No Inferences:** It excels at describing objects without inferring their purpose. For example, it calls the structure an \"A-frame wooden structure\" rather than guessing it's a swing or training equipment.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to the sequence of events in terms of video playback.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, clean paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
