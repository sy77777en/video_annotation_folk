    "pre_caption": "The video presents an abstract scene with a focus on vibrant colors and fluid motion. It begins with a bright, light-filled background that transitions into a dynamic display of swirling yellow ink. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like shapes, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The setting is undefined, emphasizing the visual spectacle of the ink's texture and flow. The overall atmosphere is bright and vivid, with the yellow ink standing out against the lighter backdrop, highlighting the contrast and fluidity of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a full evaluation of the provided caption.\n\nThe caption is partially effective. It accurately captures the core visual elements and motion but fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints in the instructions, particularly regarding subjectivity and interpretation.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual content.\n*   It correctly identifies the scene as abstract, focusing on \"vibrant colors and fluid motion.\"\n*   It accurately describes the progression: a \"bright, light-filled background\" followed by \"swirling yellow ink.\"\n*   The description of the ink forming \"intricate, cloud-like shapes\" is a precise and fitting observation of the visual texture and form.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses one key element from the instructions.\n*   It successfully describes the environment (undefined), motion (swirling, transformation), and notable visual elements (yellow ink, bright background).\n*   However, it fails to mention the **point of view**. The instructions ask to specify the POV if relevant. In this case, a \"static, close-up shot\" would be a relevant and informative detail that is missing.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has significant flaws. It violates several explicit negative constraints.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"** The caption repeatedly interprets the purpose and effect of the visual elements instead of just describing them.\n    *   **Example 1:** \"...emphasizing the visual spectacle of the ink's texture and flow.\" This sentence explains the *purpose* of the undefined setting.\n    *   **Example 2:** \"...highlighting the contrast and fluidity of the scene.\" This explains the *effect* of the color choice.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Do not infer.\"** The caption uses interpretive and subjective language that describes the viewer's potential experience rather than objective facts.\n    *   **Example 1:** \"...creating a sense of movement and transformation.\" The phrase \"creating a sense of\" is interpretive. A more direct description would be \"The ink moves and transforms.\"\n    *   **Example 2:** \"The overall atmosphere is bright and vivid...\" The word \"atmosphere\" is subjective.\n    *   **Example 3:** \"...visual spectacle...\" This is a subjective judgment of the scene's quality.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the caption provides a good general idea of the video's content, it reads more like an artistic interpretation than the objective, factual description required by the instructions. To improve, it should be rewritten to remove all explanatory phrases (\"emphasizing,\" \"highlighting,\" \"creating a sense of\") and subjective terms (\"atmosphere,\" \"spectacle\"), and it should include the static, close-up point of view.",
