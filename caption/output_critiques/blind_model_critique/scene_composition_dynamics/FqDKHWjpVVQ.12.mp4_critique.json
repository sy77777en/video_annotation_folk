    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place in a bright, sunny, outdoor environment with an arid, dusty landscape. The setting features a two-story, unfinished concrete building with open window frames, surrounded by low concrete walls, scattered trees, and green bushes. The viewpoint moves from an open area to a position of cover behind a dark structure with \"7208-JITE\" stenciled in white. During this movement, a large orange explosion erupts near the concrete building, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke. The scene is overlaid with a heads-up display (HUD), which includes a circular minimap in the lower-left corner, an ammunition count in the lower-right, and orange diamond-shaped objective markers in the central view. The lower portion of the view is consistently occupied by a black firearm.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It meticulously follows every aspect of the detailed instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly formatted.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the arid and sunny outdoor setting, the unfinished concrete building, the motion of taking cover, the orange explosion, and the specific elements of the heads-up display (HUD). The detail about the stenciled text \"7208-JITE\" demonstrates a close and precise observation of the visual information.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the required components mentioned in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as \"A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Described as a \"bright, sunny, outdoor environment with an arid, dusty landscape\" and includes specific features like the \"unfinished concrete building\" and \"low concrete walls.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Specified as \"bright, sunny.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** Details like the \"unfinished concrete,\" \"open window frames,\" the \"dark structure with '7208-JITE' stenciled in white,\" and the \"black firearm\" are all included with descriptions of their color, material, and markings.\n*   **Overlays:** The HUD is correctly identified as an overlay, and its components (minimap, ammo count, objective markers) are described with their specific content and placement.\n*   **Motion:** The movement of the viewpoint (\"moves from an open area to a position of cover\") and the action within the scene (\"a large orange explosion erupts\") are both clearly described.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect understanding and execution of the rules:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of detail into a single, coherent paragraph without being wordy.\n*   **No Prohibited Language:** It avoids subjective words (e.g., \"dramatic,\" \"intense\"), speculative phrases (\"it seems like\"), and technical terms (\"frame,\" \"image\").\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It prioritizes the setting and key events over the character, whose presence is only implied by the POV and the firearm, as instructed.\n*   **No Inference:** The caption describes the scene as it is, without inferring that it's a \"battlefield,\" \"training ground,\" or part of a specific video game.\n*   **Logical Flow:** The description starts with the overall POV and environment, moves to specific structures, describes the central action (movement and explosion), and finishes by detailing the persistent overlays. This structure is logical and easy to follow.\n*   **Formatting:** It returns only the single-paragraph description without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is objective, descriptive, and thorough, capturing the essence of the video clip in a way that is both detailed and easy to understand.",
