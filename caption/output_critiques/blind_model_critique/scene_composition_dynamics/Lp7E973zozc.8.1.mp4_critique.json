    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but has several key omissions and a minor violation of the instructions. It successfully provides a concise description of the scene's main elements but fails to include required information and uses prohibited phrasing.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The description of the scene's components is accurate. It correctly identifies the woman on a stage, the dark background, the large blue structure to the right, and its ribbed texture. The description of the lighting is also factually correct.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing - Point of View:** The caption fails to describe the point of view (e.g., a static medium shot, a wide shot). This is a required element in the instructions.\n*   **Missing - Motion:** The caption describes a static scene (\"A woman stands...\"). For a video, it is crucial to describe any motion, such as the woman speaking or gesturing, or any camera movement (pan, zoom, etc.). This is a significant omission.\n*   **Incomplete - Setting:** While \"stage\" implies an indoor setting, the instructions ask to \"clearly identify whether it is indoors or outdoors.\" Stating this explicitly would improve adherence.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Violation - Explaining Emphasis:** The phrase \"lit to highlight the speaker\" violates the rule: \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\" It describes the *purpose* of the lighting rather than simply the visual effect. A more compliant phrasing would be, \"A light source illuminates the speaker, while the rest of the environment remains in shadow.\"\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption correctly avoids emotional adjectives, speculation, and inference about the event's nature (e.g., \"conference\" or \"performance\"). It focuses on the scenery over the subject and uses simple, clear language. It is also formatted as a single, concise paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a solid foundation by accurately describing the static visual elements. However, it needs to be improved by adding the point of view and any motion present in the video, and by rephrasing the description of the lighting to be purely descriptive rather than interpretive.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a static medium shot of a woman standing on a stage indoors against a dark, black background. To the right, a large, vertically-oriented structure is illuminated in a bright, solid blue, with a ribbed or segmented texture. The woman is speaking and gesturing, while a light source illuminates her, leaving the rest of the environment in shadow.",
