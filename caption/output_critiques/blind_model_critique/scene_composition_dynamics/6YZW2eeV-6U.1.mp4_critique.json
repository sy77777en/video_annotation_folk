    "pre_caption": "The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into a stone tunnel. The setting is outdoors, featuring a narrow passageway with textured stone walls and ceiling, suggesting an ancient or historical structure. The stone surfaces are rough and uneven, with a sandy beige color. The time of day appears to be bright, likely midday, as natural light illuminates the scene. The environment is dry, with no visible vegetation or water. The passageway leads downward, creating a sense of movement as the viewer progresses deeper into the tunnel. The overall atmosphere is one of exploration, with the stone architecture being the most prominent visual element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nWhile it correctly identifies some key elements like the point of view and the general setting, it violates several core negative constraints of the instructions, making it non-compliant.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption accurately describes a first-person descent into a stone tunnel with sandy beige, rough-textured walls, which is consistent with a plausible video scene.\n*   It correctly identifies the motion as \"descending\" and the environment as \"outdoors\" and \"dry.\"\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption successfully includes the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements (stone texture and color), as requested.\n*   It describes the motion within the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following critical ways:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Speculative Language.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...**suggesting** an ancient or historical structure.\" and \"The time of day **appears to be** bright, **likely** midday...\"\n    *   **Feedback:** The words \"suggesting,\" \"appears to be,\" and \"likely\" are explicitly forbidden speculative terms. The description should only state what is visible.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"The overall **atmosphere is one of exploration**...\"\n    *   **Feedback:** \"Atmosphere of exploration\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood, not a direct visual description.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Explaining Emphasis.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...with the stone architecture being the **most prominent visual element**.\"\n    *   **Feedback:** This statement explains what the scene highlights, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation 4: Inferring the Role of the Setting.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"...**suggesting an ancient or historical structure**.\"\n    *   **Feedback:** This infers a historical context for the tunnel, which is a violation of the instruction.\n\n*   **Violation 5: Including Introductory Text.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n    *   **Caption:** \"**The video presents** a first-person POV shot...\"\n    *   **Feedback:** The phrase \"The video presents\" is introductory text and should be omitted.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Example Adhering to All Instructions:\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, the perspective moves downward into a stone tunnel. The outdoor setting features a narrow passageway with rough, textured stone walls and a ceiling of a sandy beige color. The passage is illuminated by bright, natural light.
