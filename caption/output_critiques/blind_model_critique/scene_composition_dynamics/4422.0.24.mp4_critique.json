    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. \n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is good but incomplete. It successfully captures the static elements of the scene with accuracy and adheres to many of the stylistic rules, but it fails to describe the dynamic aspects required for a video description.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as an \"urban rooftop,\" the weather as \"grey, overcast,\" and the background as a \"sprawling cityscape\" with a \"distinct tower.\"\n*   The details about the visual elements are precise, such as the \"low, dark brick wall\" and the \"metallic drum cymbals\" with specific \"PAISTE\" markings.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing Motion:** The most significant omission is the lack of any description of motion. The instructions require describing movements like \"wind blowing through trees\" or \"traffic flowing.\" The caption describes the scene as if it were a still photograph, not a video. It does not mention if the camera is moving (panning, tilting), if the cymbals are swaying, or if there is any other movement.\n*   **Missing Point of View:** The caption does not specify the point of view (e.g., static shot, handheld, first-person), which is a required element in the instructions. This context is important for understanding how the scene is presented to the viewer.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption provides a clear and brief overview of the scene.\n    *   **Focus on Setting:** It correctly prioritizes the environment and scenery over any potential subjects.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   **Element Description:** It follows the instructions to describe the color, material, and markings of notable objects (brick wall, cymbals).\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The caption fails to follow the key instruction to \"describe motion or changes,\" which is fundamental to describing a video.\n    *   It omits the \"point of view,\" a specific requirement mentioned in the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the caption is well-written and accurately describes the static composition of the scene, it is not a good caption for a **video** because it completely omits any description of movement or camera perspective. To be compliant with the instructions, it would need to incorporate these dynamic elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a sweeping panoramic shot of an urban rooftop under a grey, overcast sky. The camera slowly pans across a sprawling cityscape, highlighting buildings of various heights and a distinct tower in the distance. A gentle breeze causes the metallic drum cymbals, prominently marked with \"PAISTE,\" to sway slightly, adding a subtle motion to the scene. The low, dark brick wall lining part of the rooftop remains steady as the camera continues its smooth movement, providing a comprehensive view of the setting from a static point of view.",
