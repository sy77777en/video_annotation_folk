    "pre_caption": "From the deck of a moving ferry, the scene captures a crossing over a wide body of water during a dramatic sunset. The sky is filled with dark, heavy clouds, while the horizon glows with orange and yellow light from the setting sun. In the distance, a city skyline is silhouetted against the colorful sky. The ferry's deck is crowded with vehicles, including a dark green SUV and a black SUV, parked alongside motorcycles. Numerous passengers are visible among the vehicles, standing and sitting as the ferry moves through the choppy water, which reflects the evening light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\n*   **Video:** A handheld, first-person shot from a ferry. The camera starts by looking down at the vehicles on the car deck, then slowly pans right and up, across the water towards a distant city skyline at sunset. The water has visible whitecaps from the wind. A flag on the ferry is flapping. People are seen as silhouettes against the railing. A small, semi-transparent watermark is in the bottom-right corner.\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the core elements of the scene, it lacks specificity regarding the point of view and key visual details that define the experience. The description of the ferry is incomplete, as it omits the prominent white metal railings and the attached orange, circular life preservers that frame the view of the water. The caption describes the scene statically, but the video involves a slow, deliberate pan from the parked vehicles toward the skyline, a crucial motion that guides the viewer's focus. The term \"choppy water\" is accurate but undersells the visual impact of the strong wind, which is evident from the visible whitecaps on the waves and a ferry flag flapping energetically in the upper portion of the view. Furthermore, the description of the passengers is vague; they are more specifically seen as silhouettes leaning against the railing, gazing at the sunset, which provides better context. Lastly, the caption fails to mention a semi-transparent watermark overlay bearing a creator's handle, which is consistently visible in the bottom-right corner.",
