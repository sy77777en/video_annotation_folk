    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is well-written and follows several instructions, but it fails on one critical point regarding the level of detail used to describe the subject.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is accurate. It correctly identifies the tight close-up, the monochromatic red lighting, the deep shadows, the dark background, and the presence and placement of white subtitles.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully includes most of the required elements: the point of view (implied by \"tight close-up\"), the environment (a dark, out-of-focus background), and notable visual elements (the specific lighting and the subtitle overlay).\n*   It correctly omits details that are not visible or applicable, such as the time of day or a specific setting.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n    *   It correctly identifies the subtitles as an overlay element.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and concise.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary issue is the violation of the instruction: \"**Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions**\" and \"ensure their placement and context complement the scene **without excessive detail**.\" The caption dedicates too much focus to the subject's specific features (\"long, wavy hair,\" \"wide, dark eyes\") and action (\"stares directly forward\"). This level of detail shifts the focus from the overall scene to the person, which directly contradicts the prompt's requirements. A better approach would be to simply mention the presence of a person's face as part of the scene's composition without describing their appearance in such detail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good in its technical execution and adherence to stylistic rules. However, it is not a good caption **for the given instructions** because it fails to follow the fundamental directive to prioritize the setting over the subject. The detailed description of the person's face makes them the central focus, which is explicitly what the instructions advise against.",
