    "pre_caption": "In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them as they navigate a dark, abstract environment. The setting consists of a narrow, maze-like corridor with tall, black, textured walls and a solid dark gray-teal floor. An orange, particle-based shape moves forward through the center of the path. To the left, a white, curved object is positioned near a wall marked with red splatters, while a simple, light gray rectangular block is visible on the right. The camera follows the central shape's progression through the angular passages.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed directly above the character and looks down on them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres closely to the provided instructions, offering a clear and objective description of the video.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is precise and fact-based. It details colors (\"black,\" \"dark gray-teal,\" \"orange,\" \"white,\" \"red\"), shapes (\"narrow, maze-like corridor,\" \"curved object,\" \"rectangular block\"), and textures (\"textured walls,\" \"particle-based shape\") accurately.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers all relevant aspects requested:\n    *   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"top-down or oblique top-down view\" and explains the camera's behavior (\"follows the central shape's progression\").\n    *   **Setting:** It establishes the scene as a \"gaming video\" within a \"dark, abstract environment\" and a \"narrow, maze-like corridor.\"\n    *   **Notable Elements:** It describes the walls, floor, and other objects with sufficient detail.\n    *   **Motion:** It clearly describes the movement of the central shape and the camera.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption avoids emotional or subjective language (e.g., \"eerie,\" \"exciting\").\n    *   It correctly focuses on the setting and scenery rather than providing excessive detail about the subject.\n    *   It avoids speculation, inference, and forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   The description is consolidated into a single, coherent paragraph as required.\n    *   It correctly identifies the context as a \"gaming video,\" which is essential for understanding the visual style.\n\n*   **Areas for Minor Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction states to \"avoid ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The phrase \"top-down or oblique top-down view\" is an example of this. It would be stronger to choose the most accurate term, such as \"oblique top-down view,\" which is more descriptive.\n    *   The first sentence is slightly redundant. Stating the view is \"top-down\" and then explaining that the \"camera is placed directly above... and looks down\" says the same thing twice. A more concise opening would be: \"From an oblique top-down view, the camera follows a character through a dark, abstract environment in a gaming video.\"\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by providing a detailed, objective, and well-structured description. The minor points for improvement are subtle refinements rather than significant errors.",
