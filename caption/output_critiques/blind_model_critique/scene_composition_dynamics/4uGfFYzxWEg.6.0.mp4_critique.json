    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, the scene is set in a dark, indoor room dominated by a long wooden desk and a large bank of CRT monitors. Two low-polygon, white, geometric figures occupy blue office chairs at the desk, which holds two beige keyboards and a white mug. The multiple screens are all tuned to the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\", displaying a male contestant and various multiple-choice questions. The primary light source is the glow from these monitors, which illuminates the figures and the desk. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\", and another text overlay appears in the lower-left quadrant stating \"192 coughs\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and adheres very well to the provided instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the specified formatting and stylistic rules.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key elements of the scene, which appears to be a 3D recreation of the \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" coughing scandal. The details are precise, from the description of the low-polygon figures and CRT monitors to the specific content on the screens and the text of the overlays. The description of the lighting being sourced from the monitors is also a key, accurate detail.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and covers nearly all the required aspects from the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** Correctly identified as \"a high-angle perspective.\"\n*   **Setting:** Clearly described as a \"dark, indoor room.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** Implied effectively by describing the room as \"dark\" and lit only by the \"glow from these monitors.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** All major elements are included and described with appropriate detail (desk, monitors, chairs, keyboards, mug, figures). Their material (\"wooden\"), color (\"blue,\" \"beige,\" \"white\"), and shape (\"geometric\") are noted.\n*   **Overlays:** Both overlays are correctly identified as such, with their specific content and placement described.\n*   **Motion:** The only potential omission is the description of motion. The video on the CRT monitors is likely playing, which constitutes movement. A phrase like \"The multiple screens display the game show...\" could be slightly adjusted to \"...display footage from the game show...\" to better imply this motion. However, this is a very minor point, and for a concise description, its absence is acceptable.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates an outstanding adherence to the specific rules:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise while remaining highly informative.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Focus:** The focus is correctly placed on the setting and scenery. The figures are described as elements within the scene rather than as active subjects with intent.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"eerie,\" \"suspenseful\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"perhaps\").\n*   **No Inference:** It refrains from inferring the purpose of the scene (e.g., \"a re-enactment\" or \"a control room\"), sticking strictly to what is visible.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and clear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a high-quality caption that serves as a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, objective, and well-structured, capturing the essential visual information of the scene perfectly. The minor point about describing motion is the only area for potential, but not essential, improvement.",
