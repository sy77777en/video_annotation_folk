    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, a chaotic scene unfolds during the daytime in a narrow urban street flanked by multi-story industrial buildings. A series of explosions erupts down the length of the street, creating large fireballs and plumes of black and grey smoke that billow into the air. The paved road is littered with debris, including scattered white papers, overturned vehicles, and a fallen utility pole. A silver sedan is parked in the foreground, while a wrecked yellow taxi and a red car are visible further down amidst the destruction. The light-colored buildings feature numerous windows and loading docks, with large, wrapped bales of material stacked along the side.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully adheres to all the specified rules, resulting in a clear, objective, and comprehensive description.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption describes a coherent and internally consistent scene. The elements mentioned—explosions, smoke, debris, wrecked vehicles, and an industrial street setting—logically fit together to form a plausible event. The description is detailed and specific, suggesting it is an accurate representation of the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very thorough and includes all the key elements requested in the instructions:\n*   **Point of View:** It correctly identifies the \"high-angle perspective.\"\n*   **Setting & Environment:** It clearly establishes the scene as an \"urban street flanked by multi-story industrial buildings.\"\n*   **Time of Day:** It specifies that the event occurs \"during the daytime.\"\n*   **Motion:** It effectively describes the action with phrases like \"explosions erupts\" and \"smoke that billow.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It meticulously details key objects, including their colors (\"silver sedan,\" \"yellow taxi,\" \"red car\"), materials (\"paved road\"), and state (\"overturned vehicles,\" \"wrecked yellow taxi,\" \"fallen utility pole\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels at following the specific constraints and guidelines:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, well-structured paragraph without being wordy.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. The word \"chaotic\" is used appropriately as a factual descriptor for a state of disorder, which is immediately substantiated by objective details like \"explosions,\" \"debris,\" and \"overturned vehicles.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** The language is definitive and avoids ambiguous terms like \"appears to be\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** The description prioritizes the setting, action, and environment over any potential human subjects, perfectly aligning with the instruction to \"Focus on the setting and scenery.\"\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to the sequence of events in a way that breaks the narrative flow (e.g., \"in the first part\").\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description is organized logically, starting with the overall perspective and setting, moving to the primary action (explosions), and then detailing the static elements and debris within the scene.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and structured precisely as requested.",
