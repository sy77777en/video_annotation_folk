    "pre_caption": "The video captures an outdoor setting along a narrow pathway bordered by dense hedges adorned with yellow flowers. The ground is covered with a thick layer of fallen yellow petals, creating a vibrant contrast against the gray pavement. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the area. In the background, a fence runs parallel to the path, and a few trees are visible, adding to the natural ambiance. A distant view of a road with a parked red car suggests a suburban or park-like environment. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the notable visual elements being the bright yellow petals and the lush greenery of the hedges.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it accurately captures some visual elements, it violates several key negative constraints and omits required information.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its failings:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The description of the physical elements (path, hedges, flowers, petals, fence, car) is generally accurate.\n*   However, the statement \"...suggests a suburban or park-like environment\" is a speculative inference, which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Point of View:** The caption completely omits the point of view. It does not state whether this is a first-person shot, a static tripod shot, a drone shot, or if the camera is panning or moving. This is a mandatory element requested in the instructions.\n*   **Motion:** The caption describes a static scene as if it were a photograph. It fails to mention any motion, such as the camera moving along the path, wind blowing the petals, or cars moving on the distant road. The instruction specifically asks to describe motion if present.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several explicit negative constraints:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":**\n    *   \"...hedges **adorned** with yellow flowers...\" (\"Adorned\" is an interpretive word).\n    *   \"...creating a **vibrant** contrast...\" (\"Vibrant\" is a subjective quality).\n    *   \"...adding to the natural **ambiance**.\" (\"Ambiance\" is an interpretive and subjective term).\n    *   \"The overall atmosphere is **calm**...\" (\"Calm\" is an emotional and subjective assessment).\n    *   \"...the **lush** greenery of the hedges.\" (\"Lush\" is a subjective descriptor).\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":**\n    *   \"...**suggests** a suburban or park-like environment.\" This is a direct violation of the rule.\n\n3.  **Violation of \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights\":**\n    *   \"...with the **notable visual elements being** the bright yellow petals and the lush greenery of the hedges.\" This is meta-commentary that explains the composition, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Corrected Example\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions, assuming the video involves a person walking:\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, the video shows movement along a narrow, outdoor pathway paved in gray. The path is bordered on both sides by dense green hedges with yellow flowers. The ground is covered with fallen yellow petals. The scene takes place during the day under natural light. In the background, a fence stands parallel to the path, with several trees and a road with a parked red car visible in the distance.",
