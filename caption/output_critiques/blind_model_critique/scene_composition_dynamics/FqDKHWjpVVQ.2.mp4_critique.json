    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a sunlit, outdoor urban environment. The setting is a dusty, unpaved road flanked by simple, light-colored buildings, some appearing worn. Palm trees and other green vegetation are visible. A white sedan is parked on the right side of the road, with another vehicle partially visible behind it. In the center of the road, a dark, boxy, turreted military-like object with glowing orange and blue elements is approached. Scattered debris, including wooden crates, litters the ground. The sky is clear. Overlay elements include a mini-map and green text in the bottom left; targeting reticles, orange diamond icons with numbers, and the word \"ATTACK\" near the center; and a blue numerical display in the bottom right. Additional orange diamond icons with numbers are visible near buildings on the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is good at establishing the point of view and general setting, but it misses key visual information that would be prominent in such a scene. The most significant omission is the lack of any description of the character's hands or the weapon they are holding, which would occupy the lower portion of the screen in a first-person view; for instance, the character could be holding a black and grey assault rifle with a digital ammo counter on its side. The description of the central \"military-like object\" is too generic; it could be improved by specifying that it is a stationary, six-legged robotic turret with a single, large glowing orange \"eye\" that swivels to track the player's movement. The caption also fails to capture the dynamic nature of the scene, such as the dust kicked up from the ground with each step, the slight sway of the camera indicating a walking motion, or the shimmering heat haze rising from the sun-baked road. While the overlays are mentioned, their content could be more specific; for example, the green text in the bottom left could be an objective update like \"DESTROY THE ANTI-AIR TURRET,\" and the orange diamond icons could have distance markers that decrease as the player advances. Finally, the environment feels static; adding details like tattered fabric awnings fluttering in a light breeze or scorch marks and bullet holes on the building walls would provide more context and visual interest.",
