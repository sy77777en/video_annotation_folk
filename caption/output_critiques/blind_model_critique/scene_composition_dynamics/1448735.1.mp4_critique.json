    "pre_caption": "The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, dense forest setting during daylight. Tall trees with textured bark and vibrant green foliage dominate the scene, creating a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with a mix of moss, rocks, and fallen branches, adding texture and depth. A narrow dirt path winds through the trees, suggesting a natural trail. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the drone's perspective providing a sweeping view of the forest's expanse and intricate details.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is good in its general description but has several significant deviations from the provided instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and the description of motion.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's content. It correctly identifies the drone POV, the dense forest environment, the time of day (daylight), and key visual elements like the tall trees with textured bark, green foliage, the sunlight filtering through the canopy, the mossy ground, and the winding dirt path. All these details are present in the video.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete but omits one key detail.\n*   **What it includes:** It successfully covers the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements.\n*   **What it misses:** It fails to describe the primary **motion** in the video. The entire scene is defined by the drone's continuous and smooth forward flight through the trees, which is a crucial aspect of the viewing experience. The instruction asks to describe \"human-made movements such as traffic flowing,\" and the drone's movement falls into this category.\n\n**3. Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues. It violates several key negative constraints.\n\n*   **Violation:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n    *   The caption uses words like \"**lush**,\" \"**vibrant**,\" \"**serene**,\" and \"**untouched**.\" These are subjective interpretations of the scene's atmosphere and quality, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n\n*   **Violation:** \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Do not infer the role of the scene setting.\"\n    *   The phrase \"**suggesting a natural trail**\" is both speculative (\"suggesting\") and infers the purpose of the path (\"a natural trail\"). The instruction is to describe only what is visible.\n\n*   **Violation:** \"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"\n    *   The phrase \"**adding texture and depth**\" explains the *effect* of the ground cover, which is an interpretation of what the scene highlights.\n    *   The final clause, \"...with the drone's perspective **providing a sweeping view of the forest's expanse and intricate details**,\" also explains the effect and purpose of the POV rather than simply describing the scene from that perspective.\n\n*   **Minor Deviation:** \"Avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\"\n    *   The caption begins with \"**The video... showcases...**\" While not \"image\" or \"frame,\" this phrasing describes the media itself rather than immersing the reader directly in the scene as instructed. A more compliant opening would be something like, \"From a drone's point of view, the camera moves through...\"\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption provides a factually correct and well-written summary of the scene's appearance. However, it fails to adhere to the strict, objective style demanded by the instructions. It includes subjective and emotional language, makes speculative inferences, explains the visual effects, and omits the critical element of motion. To be compliant, it would need to be rewritten to be more neutral and to include a description of the drone's flight.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a drone's point of view, the camera moves smoothly and continuously forward through a dense forest during daylight. Tall trees with textured bark and green foliage create a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with moss, rocks, and fallen branches. A narrow dirt path winds through the trees. The drone's movement provides a comprehensive view of the forest's expanse and details.",
