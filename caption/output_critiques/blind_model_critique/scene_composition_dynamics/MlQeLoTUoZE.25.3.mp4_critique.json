    "pre_caption": "An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character, shows their upper body and the scene ahead within a dimly lit, futuristic indoor space resembling a hangar. The environment features dark, metallic walls and structural elements, with the indistinct shapes of vehicles visible in the background. Facing the viewpoint is a figure clad in green, scuffed metallic armor with a reflective orange visor, holding a large, dark weapon. The back of the foreground character, who has short, dark hair, is translucent blue and marked with glowing, circuit-like patterns. During the scene, the armored figure takes a step forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the basic elements of the scene, it misses several key visual details and dynamic effects that define the atmosphere. The description of the lighting as \"dimly lit\" is an oversimplification; the hangar is characterized by harsh, focused spotlights from above that cast long, moving shadows, and intermittent sparks fall from the ceiling in the background. The \"translucent blue\" back of the foreground character is not static but an animated holographic projection, with the circuit-like patterns pulsing rhythmically with a soft, humming light that reflects off the floor. The \"indistinct shapes of vehicles\" in the background are more specific, including a large, angular dropship with visible landing struts and heat haze shimmering from its engines. Furthermore, the caption omits that as the armored figure steps forward, the camera performs a slow, subtle push-in, increasing the sense of confrontation. The figure's orange visor is not just reflective; it has a faint, internal glow that scans from side to side. Lastly, a faint, transparent data overlay is visible at the bottom edge of the view, displaying fluctuating power levels and a targeting reticle that flickers around the armored figure.",
