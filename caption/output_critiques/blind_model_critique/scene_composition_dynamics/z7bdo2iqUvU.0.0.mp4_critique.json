    "pre_caption": "The video presents a dimly lit, indoor setting with a focus on a person wearing a dark jacket featuring a prominent fur-lined hood. The fur is a mix of brown and beige tones, providing a stark contrast against the black background. The jacket has visible zippers and buttons, adding metallic accents to the scene. The lighting is low, creating a shadowy atmosphere that emphasizes the texture of the fur and the material of the jacket. The overall mood is subdued, with the person centrally positioned, drawing attention to the details of their outerwear.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have just watched.\n\nThe caption incorrectly portrays the scene as static and overly focused on the subject's jacket, failing to capture the dynamic nature and environmental context of the video. It omits the crucial first-person point of view, where the viewer sees the world from the perspective of the person wearing the jacket, with the fur-lined hood visible at the top edge of the perspective. The description of a \"black background\" is inaccurate; the setting is a dimly lit underground subway station, and the person is walking along a concrete platform, with tiled walls and distant fluorescent lights creating a sense of depth and motion. The caption also fails to mention the movement of other people in the background and the subtle camera shake that suggests walking. Furthermore, it neglects to describe a key overlay: a semi-transparent white location tag in the top-left corner that reads \"Central Line.\" The use of phrases like \"emphasizes the texture\" and \"drawing attention to\" is interpretive and violates the instruction to avoid explaining the scene's highlights. A more accurate description would incorporate the first-person motion, the specific subway environment, and the text overlay, while reducing the excessive focus on the jacket's material.",
