    "pre_caption": "The scene is a dimly lit, opulent room at night, viewed from a low angle. A strong beam of cool, blue light shines from a window on the left, illuminating a large, dark desk. On the desk sits a glass decanter, a small gold-colored box, blue papers, and a tall, dark statuette with a glowing blue, web-like energy pattern at its base. Behind the desk, an ornate, gold-framed mirror hangs on the wall. The window on the left is framed by a pink curtain, and outside, the sky is dark. The foreground is dominated by the dark silhouette of a chair back, and the majority of the room remains in deep shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It correctly identifies specific objects like the \"glass decanter,\" \"gold-colored box,\" and \"ornate, gold-framed mirror.\" The details are precise, such as the \"cool, blue light,\" the \"pink curtain,\" and the \"glowing blue, web-like energy pattern\" on the statuette, which demonstrates a careful observation of the scene's key elements.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a comprehensive overview of the scene without being overly long. It successfully incorporates all the required elements:\n*   **Point of View:** Clearly stated as a \"low angle.\"\n*   **Environment & Setting:** Described as a \"dimly lit, opulent room\" (indoors).\n*   **Time of Day:** Specified as \"at night.\"\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** It details the desk, the items on it, the mirror, the window, and the lighting, including their colors and distinguishing features. The description of the foreground \"dark silhouette of a chair back\" is an excellent detail that completes the composition.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It balances detail with brevity, creating a clear picture in a single paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Setting:** The description prioritizes the environment and its objects over any potential subjects, as requested.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\"). The word \"opulent\" is a descriptive adjective for a style rather than a subjective opinion, and it is used appropriately here to convey the room's character concisely.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Describes Motion:** It correctly notes the \"glowing\" energy pattern, which implies subtle animation or movement within the static scene.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is descriptive, precise, and objective, perfectly capturing the essence of the scene in the required format and style.",
