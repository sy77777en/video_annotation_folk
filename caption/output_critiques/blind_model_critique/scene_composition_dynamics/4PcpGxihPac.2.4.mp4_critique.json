    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the detailed instructions provided. It is accurate, concise, and descriptive, capturing the essential visual information of the scene.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene as a \"dimly lit indoor setting\" with a \"close-up\" on the subject is perfectly accurate.\n*   The details about the subject (\"man with a beard whose face is covered in red blood\") are correct and stick to observable facts.\n*   The description of the lighting (\"cool, blue-green light from above\"), the background (\"dark and out of focus\"), and the resulting visual style (\"grainy texture\") is precise and true to the video.\n*   The identification of the \"white subtitles\" as an \"overlay at the bottom\" is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Point of View:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as a \"close-up,\" which effectively describes the perspective.\n*   **Setting & Environment:** \"Dimly lit indoor setting\" is a complete and accurate description given the lack of background detail.\n*   **Notable Visual Elements:** The caption successfully covers the key elements: the subject, the blood, the specific lighting, the out-of-focus background, and the grainy texture.\n*   **Overlays:** The subtitles are correctly identified and described as an overlay element.\n*   The caption successfully combines details from the video into a single, coherent description without referring to specific moments.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"scary,\" \"intense\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it appears to be,\" \"he might be\").\n*   **Focus:** It focuses on the visual characteristics of the scene (lighting, color, texture) rather than inferring a narrative or the subject's emotional state.\n*   **Formatting:** It correctly returns only the single-paragraph description without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Negative Constraints:** The caption successfully avoids forbidden terms (\"image,\" \"frame\"), does not infer the setting's role, and does not explain what the scene emphasizes.\n\n**Minor Point for Improvement:**\n*   The instructions mention describing motion if present. The man's head and face move slightly throughout the video. While very minor, mentioning this subtle movement (e.g., \"the man's head moves slightly\") could make the description even more complete. However, its omission does not significantly detract from the overall high quality of the caption, as the scene is largely static.\n\nOverall, the caption is a high-quality example that demonstrates a thorough understanding and application of all the provided guidelines.",
