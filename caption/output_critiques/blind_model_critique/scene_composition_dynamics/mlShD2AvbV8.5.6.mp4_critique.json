    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor setting, viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, focusing on a character's upper body and the scene ahead. The environment appears to be a spacious, well-lit room, possibly a gym or studio, with white walls and a high ceiling featuring exposed pipes and fluorescent lights. The time of day is indeterminate due to the artificial lighting. In the background, a group of people is visible, standing in a line, dressed in casual athletic wear with various colors and patterns. The scene conveys a sense of organized activity or instruction, with the character in the foreground seemingly observing or engaging with the group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it successfully captures some elements, it fails on several critical points of the instructions, particularly regarding speculation, inference, and completeness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Problem:** The caption uses speculative and uncertain language, which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\"\n*   **Examples from the caption:**\n    *   \"...the environment **appears to be** a spacious, well-lit room...\"\n    *   \"...**possibly** a gym or studio...\"\n    *   \"...the character in the foreground **seemingly** observing or engaging...\"\n*   **Correction:** The caption should only state what is definitively visible. For instance, instead of \"possibly a gym or studio,\" it should simply describe the features of the room (e.g., \"a spacious room with white walls\").\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Problem:** The caption completely omits any description of **motion or changes**, a key requirement of the instructions (\"If the scene involves motion or changes, describe... human-made movements such as... pedestrians walking\"). It is highly likely that a video with multiple people would feature some form of movement, which is a critical detail to include.\n*   **Problem:** It also fails to mention if there are any **scene transitions**, another specific requirement. If the video is a single, continuous shot, this should be implicitly clear, but if there are cuts or pans, they must be described.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly.\n\n*   **Violation 1: Inferring Purpose and Context:** The instructions state, **\"Do not infer the role of the scene setting\"** and **\"Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\"** The caption violates this rule directly and repeatedly.\n    *   **Example:** \"...**possibly a gym or studio**...\" This infers the room's function.\n    *   **Example:** \"**The scene conveys a sense of organized activity or instruction**...\" This is a pure interpretation of the scene's meaning and purpose, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Using Speculative Language:** As mentioned under \"Accuracy,\" the use of \"appears to be,\" \"possibly,\" and \"seemingly\" directly contradicts the instructions.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" While \"well-lit\" can be considered factual, \"spacious\" is subjective and depends on the viewer's interpretation of the room's size.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is not good because it fundamentally misunderstands the core constraints of the instructions. It succeeds in identifying the point of view and basic setting elements but fails by including speculation, inferring the purpose of the scene, and omitting required details like motion. A good caption, according to the rules, would be a purely objective, descriptive inventory of the visible scene, stripped of all interpretation and uncertainty.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor setting from an over-the-shoulder perspective, focusing on a character's upper body and the scene ahead. The room has white walls, a high ceiling with exposed pipes, and fluorescent lights. A group of people stands in a line, wearing casual athletic wear in various colors and patterns. The scene is well-lit with artificial lighting. The video captures the people moving slightly, indicating some form of activity or interaction. There are no visible scene transitions, suggesting a continuous shot.",
