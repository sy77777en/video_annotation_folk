    "pre_caption": "The video captures a first-person perspective of a kayaker navigating through a narrow, dark rock canyon filled with turbulent, white whitewater. The kayaker, wearing a red jacket, a grey helmet with orange and white markings, and a life vest, paddles vigorously. The dark, textured rock walls of the canyon rise steeply on either side of the rushing water. Another kayaker in a red kayak is briefly visible further down the waterway. The scene is dynamic, with water splashing and the kayaker actively maneuvering through the rapids.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the crucial first-person point of view, likely from a helmet-mounted camera, which defines the viewer's immersive experience. While it describes a 'dark rock canyon,' it misses key environmental details such as the glistening, water-streaked texture of the rock walls, patches of green moss near the waterline, and the limited sunlight filtering down from the canyon's rim, which creates areas of deep shadow. The description of 'turbulent whitewater' is general and could be more specific by mentioning the churning, brown color of the sediment-filled water and the distinct standing waves the kayaker maneuvers through. The caption provides excessive detail on the kayaker's clothing and helmet, which detracts from the focus on the scenery. Additionally, it fails to mention the water droplets that frequently splash onto the camera lens, temporarily blurring the view, or a small, white brand logo watermark overlaid in the bottom-right corner. The motion is described as 'dynamic,' but it would be more effective to describe the physical effect of the motion, such as the jarring camera shakes and the horizon tilting sharply as the kayak navigates the rapids.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video offers an immersive first-person perspective from a helmet-mounted camera as a kayaker navigates through a narrow, dark rock canyon. The glistening, water-streaked rock walls rise steeply, adorned with patches of green moss near the waterline, while limited sunlight filters down from the canyon's rim, casting deep shadows. The kayaker maneuvers through churning, brown sediment-filled water, skillfully tackling distinct standing waves. Water droplets frequently splash onto the camera lens, momentarily blurring the view, and a small white brand logo watermark is visible in the bottom-right corner. The scene is intensely dynamic, with jarring camera shakes and the horizon tilting sharply as the kayak powers through the rapids.",
