    "pre_caption": "From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to a hammerhead shark, the perspective is of a clear, turquoise underwater scene during the day. The camera glides forward over a bright, sandy ocean floor, which is illuminated by sunlight filtering through the water's surface. The distinctive, dark, T-shaped head of the hammerhead is visible at the bottom of the view. In the upper right, another shark swims through the water, and a small, silvery fish can be seen in the middle distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the first-person perspective from the hammerhead shark, but it overlooks several key visual details. The description of the \"bright, sandy ocean floor\" is too simplistic; the video shows distinct, wave-like ripples in the sand from the current, as well as sparse patches of short, green seagrass. While the caption mentions \"sunlight filtering through,\" it fails to describe the prominent and dynamic caustic patterns—a shimmering, web-like network of light—that constantly shift across the seafloor as the shark swims. The movement is described as \"glides forward,\" which misses the shark's characteristic and continuous side-to-side scanning motion of its head, a dominant part of the visual experience. Additionally, the \"two additional sharks\" are clearly identifiable as fellow hammerheads, suggesting the main subject is part of a small school, and the \"small, silvery fish\" are not just in the background but form a dense, cohesive school that parts and flows around the sharks. Finally, the caption omits a persistent overlay: a small, semi-transparent watermark in the bottom-left corner for the \"Oceanic Institute\" with a stylized manta ray logo.",
