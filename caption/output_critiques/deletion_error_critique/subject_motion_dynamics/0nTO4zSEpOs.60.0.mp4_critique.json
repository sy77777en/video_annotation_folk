Simultaneously, several other pedestrians, including a woman in a beige outfit and men in blue, plaid, and black shirts, descend the stairs toward the camera. Other people can be seen walking both up and down the stairs in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",
