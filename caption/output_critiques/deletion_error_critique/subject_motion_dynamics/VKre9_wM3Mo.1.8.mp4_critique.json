    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of a flush toilet, focusing on the tank and the water inside it. The lid of the tank starts to lift, revealing the blue water inside. As the lid continues to rise, the water level in the tank decreases, indicating that the water is being flushed out. The lid reaches its highest point, and the water flow from the tank into the bowl becomes more visible. The water continues to flow steadily from the tank into the bowl, gradually emptying the tank. The lid remains lifted, and the water flow persists, showing the continuous flushing process.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a white/light gray flush toilet with a partially transparent or cutaway view. The toilet features a bowl with the seat down and a rectangular tank positioned above and behind the bowl. The lid of the tank is shown levitating above it, revealing the tank's interior filled with bright blue water. As the camera moves, you can observe the flow of blue water from the rectangular tank into the toilet bowl. A white flush handle is visible on the right side of the tank, and the overall appearance suggests a ceramic or similar smooth material for the toilet's construction.**",

The video begins with a close-up view of a flush toilet,这里不是close-up view 可以删去替换成high angle view，而且也不是focusing on the tank and the water inside it，应该是focus on the whole toilet\n2. The lid reaches its highest point, and the water flow from the tank into the bowl becomes more visible. The water continues to flow steadily from the tank into the bowl, gradually emptying the tank. 这部分有很大问题。 从video来看，是看不出来水流持续稳定地从水箱注入盆中，水箱逐渐排空的，只能看到水箱盖在不断往上提，水箱中蓝色的水逐渐从toilet的内部流下，水箱内的水在不停地翻滚，但是看不出是gradually emptying the tank，甚至从video中水甚至还没有进入bowl当中",

There is a significant issue with the description of the water flow. From the video, it is not apparent that the water flows steadily from the tank into the bowl, gradually emptying the tank. Instead, the video shows the tank lid being lifted continuously, with the blue water inside the tank swirling around. It is not clear that the tank is gradually emptying, and it seems that the water has not yet entered the bowl.",
