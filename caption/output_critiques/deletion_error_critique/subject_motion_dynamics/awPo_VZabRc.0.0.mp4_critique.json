    "pre_caption": "The animated scene shows the exterior view of a train car moving horizontally from left to right, revealing its interior and passengers. Inside the passing train, various characters are depicted, most of whom remain stationary, either seated on orange benches or standing. As the train progresses, subsequent sections of the car and different groups of seated or standing passengers slide into and then out of view. Throughout this, out-of-focus vertical columns in the immediate foreground consistently pass by, underscoring the train's continuous motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows various animated characters inside a train car, viewed from the outside as the train passes. As the camera starts moving to the right, the foreground outside the window consistently shows passing columns that are out of focus due to the subway's motion. An elderly woman with short, curly white hair, wearing a brown top and a dark skirt, is seated on an orange bench. Nearby, a tall man with a long dark beard, clad in a light green t-shirt and dark pants, stands holding an overhead rail, partially obscuring another man in a dark suit. A man with spiky brown hair, seen from the back in a green t-shirt, is sitting. As the view shifts, other seated passengers appear: a man in a grey fedora and dark jacket; a man with a black baseball cap worn backwards, a dark green jacket, and ripped jeans; and a man with dark hair and a prominent mustache, wearing a dark suit. Another seated man wears a light green hoodie with a graphic, a black baseball cap, and blue pants, his mouth agape. A pale-skinned man with dark messy hair, dressed in a black jacket over a white t-shirt and dark pants, sits with his legs spread. Finally, an overweight man in a pink, belly-exposing shirt and light blue pants is seen seated. Standing passengers include a woman with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a tan jacket, and another individual with a pink backpack.**",
