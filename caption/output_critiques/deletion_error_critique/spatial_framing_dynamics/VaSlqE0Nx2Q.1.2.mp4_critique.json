    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a man primarily in the left and center foreground. His hat occupies the top left and center, while his scarf is visible at the bottom left and center. The plain sky serves as the background, occupying the right and top right areas of the frame. The camera maintains a position level with the subject. Initially, the man looks towards the camera, but he then lowers his head, causing the hat's brim to cover more of his face, especially his left eye, while his position within the frame remains largely unchanged.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the black-and-white video, a close-up focuses on a middle-aged or older man with light skin and visible wrinkles, particularly around his eyes. He has a short, graying beard and wears a dark fedora-style hat, the brim of which initially casts a shadow over the top part of his face but still reveals his eyes looking towards the viewer. He also wears a scarf with a houndstooth or similar checkered pattern around his neck. During the video, the man lowers his head, causing the brim of the hat to obscure his left eye while his right eye remains visible, casting more of his face into shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The black and white video presents a close-up view of a man outdoors against a plain, light sky. He is wearing a dark hat, the brim of which initially casts a shadow over the upper part of his face, and a patterned scarf around his neck. The man first looks towards the camera before lowering his head, bringing the hat brim further down over his face.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
