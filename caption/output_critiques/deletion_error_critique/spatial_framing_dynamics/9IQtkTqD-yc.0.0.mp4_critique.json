    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a rural landscape at night, viewed through the circular vignette of a night vision device. The focus is on the scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, the scene is dark, with a prominent, gnarled tree silhouetted in the upper left-center middle ground against a grainy green sky, flanked by a line of trees in the background. A light source then flashes on from a low angle, illuminating the lower half of the frame to reveal an unpaved road stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. This light also makes a fence and vegetation visible along the left side in the foreground and middle ground, and a small shed appears in the right middle ground next to the trees. The light source then turns off, returning the scene to its initial dark state where only the silhouettes of the trees are visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a rural landscape scenery shot, captured through night vision. There is no main subject because the focus is on the eerie atmosphere created by the night vision and the brief illumination of a desolate, unpaved road. The scene is initially very dark, with the silhouette of a prominent, bare, gnarled tree and a line of other trees visible against a grainy, greenish sky. Headlights then briefly illuminate the road, revealing its rough surface, some vegetation and a fence line along its edges, and a small wooden shed near the trees, before the light extinguishes, returning the scene to near darkness. The emphasis is on the environment and the unsettling feeling of the isolated, dimly lit location rather than a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is viewed through a night vision device, casting the entire landscape in a grainy, green monochrome and framed by a dark, circular vignette. The setting is a rural area at night. A light source intermittently flashes, illuminating a dirt road that stretches horizontally in the midground. When the light is on, a small shed is visible near both a prominent, gnarled, leafless tree and a leafy tree on the right side of the road. A fence line with weeds runs parallel to the dirt road on the left. In the far background, a wall of trees is silhouetted against the sky. The light source turns on and off, alternately revealing and obscuring the details of the landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
