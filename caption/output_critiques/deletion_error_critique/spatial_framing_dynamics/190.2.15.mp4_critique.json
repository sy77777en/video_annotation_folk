    "pre_caption": "The video features a man seated in the driver's seat of a vintage Oldsmobile, viewed through the car's windshield. The shot size is primarily focused on the man, with only his head and part of his shoulder visible, as the rest is obscured by the car. The man is wearing glasses and a dark hat, and he appears to be looking forward. The car itself is positioned prominently in the foreground, showcasing its dark, glossy finish and chrome details. The emblem on the hood is also visible, adding to the vintage aesthetic.\n\nThe background reveals an urban setting with buildings, trees, and other vehicles, indicating a typical city environment. The trees appear bare, suggesting the scene takes place during late autumn or winter. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a neutral light over the scene. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent angle and distance from the subject. The text \"Malcolm X (1992)\" is displayed at the bottom right corner of the frame, providing context for the video's title and year.\n\nThe spatial positioning of the elements within the frame is as follows:\n- The man is positioned in the center of the frame, slightly off-center towards the left due to the angle of the windshield.\n- The vintage Oldsmobile car",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man seated in the driver's seat of a vintage Oldsmobile, viewed through the car's windshield. He has a medium to dark skin tone, wears glasses, and a dark hat. His head and part of his shoulder are visible, with the rest obscured by the car. The setting appears urban, with buildings, trees, and other vehicles in the background. The text \"Malcolm X (1992)\" is displayed at the bottom.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban setting during the daytime, featuring a street lined with bare trees and classic buildings. The scene is viewed from an objective perspective, focusing on a vintage Oldsmobile car with a dark, glossy finish. The car is positioned prominently in the foreground, with its chrome details and distinctive emblem visible. The street is populated with other vehicles, suggesting a typical city environment. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a neutral light over the scene. Overlay elements include the text \"Malcolm X (1992)\" in white, positioned at the bottom right, indicating the video's title and year.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This frame shows a man in the driver’s seat, filmed through the car's windshield. Only his head and part of his shoulder are visible, with the rest hidden by the car. The background includes buildings, trees, and cars, suggesting an urban setting. The text \"Malcolm X (1992)\" appears at the bottom.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
