    "pre_caption": "This wide shot presents a diner booth table setting in the foreground, with the broader diner environment in the middle and background. In the foreground, a plate and fork are at the bottom left, a menu is in the bottom center, and a mug and bowl are to the center-right; condiment shakers and a squeeze bottle are on the far left. The booth, featuring a purple backrest and striped seat, occupies the middle ground across the center. The background reveals a diner counter with stools on the right, a window reflecting lights on the left, and various neon lights, pictures, and a menu board on the far wall. The camera is positioned at roughly seated eye-level, looking slightly down at the table. The shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a diner table setting within a booth, illuminated by cool, cyan-toned light with neon pink and purple highlights. On the white, reflective tabletop, a place setting includes a white plate with a blue rim and a fork to its left. A rectangular menu with a pink and black design rests nearby. Other items on the table are a white mug containing a dark spoon, a white bowl on a white saucer, two metallic condiment shakers, and a yellow squeeze bottle. The booth is rendered in the distinctive, stylized lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor scene from a booth in a retro-style diner, likely at night, given the prominent neon lighting. The booth features purple and white striped upholstery. On the white tabletop, there is a place setting with a white plate edged in blue, a fork, and a white menu with a pink and black checkered border. A white mug with a dark spoon and a white bowl on a saucer are also on the table, alongside salt and pepper shakers and a yellow squeeze bottle. In the background, a diner counter with teal stools is visible, illuminated by pink and green neon lights. Framed pictures and a menu board adorn the walls. A window to the left reflects lights, suggesting an urban exterior, possibly on a rainy evening. The overall atmosphere is characterized by cool-toned lighting and a hazy quality.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
