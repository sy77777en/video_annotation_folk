    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a man from the waist up, positioning him slightly left of center in the middle ground. To his right, a large, blank projector screen occupies the right portion of the frame. A light-colored wooden cabinet is visible behind him in the middle ground, situated toward the left side of the frame. The background consists of a deep red wall, with several white electrical panels mounted on the far left. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged white man with short, dark brown hair, a receding hairline, and a full dark beard and mustache stands while speaking. He is wearing a white button-down shirt, dark trousers, and a dark belt. Around his neck is a red lanyard with a name tag, and a small microphone is clipped to his shirt. He gestures with both hands as he talks, holding a small black presentation remote in his right hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors in a presentation room with a deep red back wall. A man stands slightly to the left of the center, positioned in front of a light-colored wooden lectern or cabinet. To the right, a large, blank white projector screen is visible. On the red wall, several white electrical panels are mounted. The lighting in the room is even and functional.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
