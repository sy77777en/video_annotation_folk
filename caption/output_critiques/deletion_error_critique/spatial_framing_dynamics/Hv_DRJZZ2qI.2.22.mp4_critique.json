    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a mountain biker is positioned on a wooden ramp in the upper-left middle ground, with the camera initially at the subject's level. The ramp structure extends across the center and right of the frame, with spectators visible on a platform in the top-center background and a \"Red Bull\" logo in the bottom-left foreground. The biker launches from the ramp, moving toward the center of the frame while performing a backflip. As the biker descends, the camera's perspective shifts to a high angle, looking down as they land on a dirt path in the lower-left portion of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a mountain biker wearing a red long-sleeved jersey, dark pants, and a white helmet, who rides down a large wooden ramp structure built into a reddish-brown canyon. The biker launches into the air, performs a backflip with the bike, and lands on a dirt path below. Several other people are visible in the background, standing on a wooden platform and on the hillside above, watching the biker. The course includes multiple wooden ramps, and black flags with a white circular logo are placed along the route. A large sign with the \"Red Bull\" logo is visible on the rocks at the bottom of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime scene unfolds in a rugged, reddish-brown canyon, where a large, multi-tiered wooden ramp structure is built into the steep, rocky hillside. This structure features a high starting platform and a series of curved ramps supported by a wooden framework. The arid landscape is characterized by layered rock formations and sparse green vegetation. Black flags and white, ring-shaped objects bearing logos are positioned along the course, and a prominent \"Red Bull\" logo is displayed on a rock face in the lower portion of the scene. A small group of spectators observes from a ledge above the main structure, while a cyclist on a mountain bike descends the course, launching from the upper ramp onto a dirt path below. The weather conditions are not clearly visible, but the scene suggests a dry and bright environment typical of a canyon setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
