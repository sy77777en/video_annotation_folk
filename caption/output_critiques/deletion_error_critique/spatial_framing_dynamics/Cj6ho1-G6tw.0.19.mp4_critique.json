    "pre_caption": "This medium shot begins with the front half of a cyclist and his bike framed in the left foreground. A large rock dominates the right foreground, with a beached boat positioned in the center-left middle ground. In the background, two stone seawalls are visible. The cyclist moves from left to right across the frame, briefly appearing in full before ascending a dirt mound in the right foreground and exiting from the top-right corner. The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to a position below the subject as he rides up the slope.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a Red Bull helmet that is red and blue, a gray T-shirt, and black pants rides a bright orange mountain bike with dark and green wheels, moving from left to right up a 45-degree dirt slope. In the midground, a small boat with a blue hull, a white cabin, and a red buoy attached to its stern is beached at a slight angle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set at a stone harbor during low tide, revealing a muddy, rocky shoreline. A small sailboat with a blue and white hull rests on the damp ground. In the background, two large sea walls built from stone blocks create an opening to the water under a cloudy sky. A large, weathered rock is positioned in the right foreground, while a person on an orange bicycle with a green front wheel moves across the scene from the left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a person cycling near the sea, with a small blue boat and a seawall in the background. At first, the cyclist is on the left, and only the front half of the bike is visible, along with his hands and head. As he moves forward, his full body briefly shows, but soon, he rides up a dirt mound on the right and exits the frame from the top-right corner.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to below the subject.",
