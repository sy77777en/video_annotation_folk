    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective. The video begins with a large, green paneled wall in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame, with a black door positioned in the center-right. The camera then pans to the right and moves forward, simulating a person walking into a narrow corridor. As the camera moves, the green wall shifts out of frame to the left. The final composition shows a ticket booth in the left middle ground, a white wall with a yellow emergency call box on the right, and two police officers standing in the right background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an indoor scenery shot of a public transit station corridor. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of the space rather than a specific subject, with the wide, moving perspective capturing the setting's character. The view pans from behind a green paneled wall to reveal a narrow passageway containing a ticket booth with a large glass window. On the opposite white wall, a yellow emergency call box is mounted, and further down the corridor, two police officers in dark uniforms stand conversing, contributing to the ambiance of a functional, public area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a narrow passageway within a public transit station. On one side, a large green metal wall features a black door with a small window labeled \"D-2.\" The camera turns right to enter through this doorway, revealing the interior. Opposite the green wall is a white wall with a yellow emergency call box and a separate digital display screen. The passageway contains a large, boxy kiosk with a glass window and a beige vented panel, positioned on the left side of the frame once inside. Further down, two police officers in dark uniforms stand near the white wall. The space is illuminated by overhead artificial lighting, and the floor is made of concrete, with lines creating the impression of distinct concrete rectangles.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
