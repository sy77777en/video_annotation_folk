    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot framed from behind the top of a dark vehicle that occupies the lower foreground. In the middle ground, slightly right of center, a group of police officers escorts a man toward a white and green police car. In the background, red stadium seats are visible on the left, and a \"7P\" sign is positioned in the top right. The camera then moves slightly to the right while executing a rack focus, shifting the composition to a close-up shot. In this final framing, the back of a man's head and shoulders occupies the right foreground, while the arrest scene becomes a blurred element in the background, with out-of-focus police lights. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the midground, a group of men in lighter khaki police uniforms on top with darker brown pants escort a white man in a gray shirt with a black jacket, pressing him against the hood of a white and green police car. The focus then shifts to the foreground, revealing the back of a man with short, dark, curly hair. This man, wearing a tan police uniform, is positioned beside a vehicle, observing the arrest taking place outside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a shot from behind a damaged car at night, capturing the scene as police officers escort a man to the hood of a police vehicle. The camera follows the officers, eventually settling over the left shoulder of a police officer in the foreground, providing a view of the unfolding events. In the immediate foreground, the front of the damaged vehicle and the back of the man being escorted are clearly visible. Police cars with flashing blue and red lights are present in the middle ground, along with a sign marked \"7P\" visible in the air. In the background, rows of stadium-like red seats and large tents illuminated with warm lights can be seen, adding depth to the nighttime setting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person being escorted by several police officers and then pressed against the hood of a police car in a wide shot. Through a combination of rack focus and camera movement, the focus then shifts to a close-up shot of the back of a person in the foreground, suggesting they are observing the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
