    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a stylized humanoid figure is positioned in the left middle ground, hunched over with its hands on its head. To the right of the figure, a tall stack of papers occupies the middle ground, rendered with a strong horizontal motion blur that extends off the right edge of the frame. A dark reddish-brown wall is visible in the background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, light gray humanoid figure with a smooth, featureless face is depicted seated at a table, head lowered and back hunched over. The figure wears a light blue, long-sleeved collared shirt with cuffs and cufflinks, and it clutches its head with both hands. Next to the figure is a tall stack of white papers that is blurred with a horizontal motion effect.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, animated scene with a dark reddish-brown background, a light-blue, featureless humanoid figure in a suit is hunched over on the left, holding its head in its hands. To the right of the figure, a massive stack of papers is depicted with a strong horizontal motion blur, suggesting a rapid accumulation or movement that extends off-screen. The figure's hands appear to have a faint blue glow. In the lower left corner, there is white overlay text \"[4,5]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
