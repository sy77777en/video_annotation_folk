    "pre_caption": "This first-person point-of-view shot is framed from a high-angle perspective, looking down from a mountain peak. In the immediate foreground, the arms and upper legs of a person occupy the bottom of the frame, with their hands positioned in the bottom-center as they adjust a garment. The middle ground is composed of a steep, rocky slope that fills the center of the frame. The person's shadow is cast onto this slope, located centrally and just ahead of their body. In the background, a deep valley with green areas and paths is visible in the top portion of the frame, situated far below the camera's position. The camera remains relatively static, with only slight movements in the foreground as the person's hands move to zip up their gear.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, the arms and hands of a light-skinned person are visible in the lower portion of the view. This person is wearing a bright, fluorescent yellow and dark blue garment, which they are in the process of zipping up. The person's shadow is cast onto the rocky ground ahead, forming a clear, dark silhouette of a standing human figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from the top of a high, rocky mountain peak. The ground is a steep slope covered in loose, light-colored scree and larger boulders. Far below, a vast valley with green patches and winding paths is visible. The scene is set during the daytime under a clear sky, with bright sunlight casting a distinct shadow of the person onto the rocks in front of them. The person's hands are visible adjusting a bright yellow and blue piece of equipment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
