    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, focusing on a player in a light blue uniform positioned in the left foreground, with a white and orange soccer ball at the bottom center. A second player in a yellow jersey is visible in the top left middle ground. The green soccer field occupies the majority of the frame, with trees and buildings situated in the distant background across the top. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, pans to the right, tracking the main player and the ball as they move across the foreground. Throughout this movement, the main subject remains in the foreground, while the background scrolls from right to left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a person wearing a light blue short-sleeved jersey, light blue shorts, dark purple knee-high socks, and white athletic shoes. This individual is actively dribbling a white and orange soccer ball. Running after and slightly behind this player is a second person, who is wearing a yellow short-sleeved jersey and dark-colored shorts. The focus remains on the player in the light blue uniform as they move with the ball.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a bright, sunny day, the scene is set on a green artificial turf soccer field. In the background, a line of green trees and a fence separate the field from several multi-story buildings in the distance. A white and orange soccer ball is in motion, being dribbled across the turf. The legs of a player wearing a light-colored jersey, purple socks, and white shoes are visible in the foreground, moving quickly alongside the ball.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
