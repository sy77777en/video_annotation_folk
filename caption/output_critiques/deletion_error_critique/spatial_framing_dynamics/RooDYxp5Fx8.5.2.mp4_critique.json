    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot of a bustling urban street, capturing the dynamic interaction between urban elements and natural surroundings. The scene is framed with modern buildings on the left, positioned in the middle ground, and a curved silver building on the right, also in the middle ground. Vehicles, including cars, vans, and buses, move along the road in the foreground, while pedestrians walk along the sidewalk on the left. The camera is positioned at street level, providing a first-person perspective. In the background, green hills and a clear sky with a few clouds enhance the sense of openness. The shot remains consistent throughout, maintaining a stable view of the urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban street scene. The focus is on the bustling environment, with a wide road lined by modern buildings on one side and a mix of vehicles, including cars, vans, and buses, moving along the street. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, adding to the lively atmosphere. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant green hills provide a natural backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale and openness. The emphasis is on the dynamic interaction between the urban elements and the natural surroundings, rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of a bustling urban street during the day. The scene is set outdoors, featuring a wide road lined with modern buildings on either side. On the left, a series of multi-story structures with a mix of orange and gray facades stand prominently, while on the right, a curved, silver building adds a contemporary touch. The sky is clear and blue, dotted with a few fluffy white clouds, suggesting pleasant weather. The street is busy with various vehicles, including vans, buses, and taxis, moving along the road. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, which is bordered by small trees and street lamps. The presence of traffic signs and crosswalks indicates a well-organized urban environment. In the distance, green hills provide a natural backdrop, contrasting with the urban setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
