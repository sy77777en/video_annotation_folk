    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman in a green and white jersey occupies the right foreground. To her left, another person in a black top is also in the foreground. In the middle ground, a woman in orange shorts stands left of center, and a soccer goal is positioned on the far right. The background contains other people, trees, and buildings. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a young woman with light brown skin and voluminous, curly, light brown hair, who is smiling. She wears a short-sleeved jersey that is vertically split, half dark green and half white, with black chevrons on the white sleeve. On the left side of the frame, another person with dark hair tied in a bun is seen from the side, wearing a long-sleeved black top. In the background, a young woman with blonde hair in a ponytail wears a black crop top and bright orange shorts. These individuals appear to be part of a larger group in an outdoor setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an outdoor sports court in a residential urban area during the daytime. In the background, multi-story apartment buildings with balconies are visible beyond some green trees. The court is enclosed by metal railings, and on the right side stands a soccer goal with a white frame and white netting. Several people in athletic clothing are present on the court's surface. Additionally, a wall decorated with graffiti adds a vibrant touch to the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
