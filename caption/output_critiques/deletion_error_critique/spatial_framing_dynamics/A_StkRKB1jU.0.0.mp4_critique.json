    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the cityscape, capturing a panoramic view of numerous high-rise buildings. The buildings are positioned across the frame, with some in the foreground and others extending into the background, creating a sense of depth. The camera is at a high angle, likely from a drone, providing a sweeping view of the urban environment. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, focusing on a specific building with a glass facade. This building is positioned centrally in the frame, with the glass panel that shatters located in the middle ground. The camera maintains a level height relative to the building, emphasizing the dramatic effect of the shattering glass against the backdrop of the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a dramatic cityscape scene, focusing on a multi-story building with striking glass facades. As the camera approaches, one of the glass panels unexpectedly shatters, adding a surprising and dramatic element to the urban environment. The video captures the essence of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the varied architectural designs of towering skyscrapers, and emphasizing the grandeur and complexity of the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an urban cityscape during the day. The scene features a collection of high-rise buildings with a mix of modern and classic architectural styles. The buildings are primarily composed of glass and concrete, with reflective surfaces that catch the sunlight. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the city, highlighting the geometric patterns of the windows and the grid-like arrangement of the structures. The sky is clear, adding a bright backdrop to the scene. Notably, one building's glass facade shows an explosion of one of its glass panels, creating a striking contrast with the otherwise smooth surfaces. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with normal movements on the streets, emphasizing the lively nature of the urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
