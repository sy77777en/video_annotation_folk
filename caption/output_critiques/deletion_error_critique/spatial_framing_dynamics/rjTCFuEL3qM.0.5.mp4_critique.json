    "pre_caption": "In a static, straight-on shot, a bright cyan light source is positioned in the background at the top center of the frame. From this area, numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light extend downwards through the middle ground, covering the width of the scene. Scattered throughout the entire space, from the background to the foreground, are countless small, sparkling blue particles. These particles, along with the streaks, continuously drift downwards from the top of the frame towards the bottom, creating a sense of depth and constant motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract video showcases a cascade of luminous blue elements against a dark background. From a bright, cyan-colored glow at the top of the scene, numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light move in various directions. Scattered throughout the space are countless small, sparkling particles of light, also blue, that either float independently or are attached to the middle of the vertical streaks, creating a sense of depth and a dynamic, shimmering effect.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a dark, deep-blue background, a radiant light source glows at the top center, casting a vibrant blue hue. Numerous thin, vertical streaks of light and a cascade of small, sparkling particles drift in different directions. The continuous motion of these glowing elements creates a dynamic and abstract visual.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

Remove one key detail, suggestion, or explanation from the original feedback only if it is sufficiently long\n2. If the original feedback consists of only a single sentence or item, do not simply shorten it, but replace it with 'The caption is accurate and requires no edits, so it should remain exactly the same.'\n3.

If the feedback is presented as a numbered list (e.g., 1. xxxx 2. xxxx 3. xxxx …), then when deleting, remove one item at random rather than automatically deleting the last entry\n5. Identify the portions of the feedback that conflict with the caption. These conflicting elements are relatively significant and can be prioritized for deletion, but delete only one full element from the original feedback",
