    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle, bird's-eye view, showing a white, boat-like object in the upper-center middle ground. In the foreground, a white, pointed mast extends from the bottom center of the frame, aimed at the underside of the object. The mast then shatters in the center of the frame, creating a cloud of debris. Following the break, the camera pulls back and tilts downward. The boat-like object moves to the top edge of the frame, while the now-separated pieces of the mast become the central subject. The upper section of the broken mast is in the upper center, the lower section is in the bottom center, and other fragments, including a long piece and a smaller T-shaped piece, fall through the middle and bottom-right of the frame, respectively.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, elongated, boat-like object with a smooth, curved hull and a flat stern featuring several small, rectangular indentations is shown against a dark, textured background. In the foreground, a long, white, pointed mast or drill pipe is initially aimed at the underside of the vessel. This mast then shatters near its tip, creating a spray of small, white and dark particles. The mast is then shown broken into three separate white, cylindrical sections that are falling apart. One of the smaller, broken-off pieces has a T-shaped end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, deep environment, a white, oblong vessel is viewed from above. A long, white, pointed pipe, integral to the vessel, extends upwards towards the camera. The pipe appears to be on the verge of cracking from the start, and eventually breaks into separate sections. The fragmented pieces tumble downward into the dark expanse, surrounded by a cloud of small, white debris.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a boat-like object against a black background. It begins with a bird's eye view of the boat. In the foreground is the boat’s mast, broken in the middle with a particle debris effect at the fracture. The camera then shifts to an upside-down, level angle and pulls back, revealing the mast broken into three sections.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
