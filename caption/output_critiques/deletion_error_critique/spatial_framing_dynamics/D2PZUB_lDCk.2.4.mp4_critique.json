    "pre_caption": "This abstract scene is framed with a dynamic, wavy surface composed of golden particles positioned across the bottom of the frame in the foreground. A bright, horizontal light source is located in the center-bottom of the frame, serving as a horizon in the middle ground. From this central point, numerous thin, vertical beams of light and smaller floating particles continuously rise upwards, moving from the middle ground toward the top of the frame and filling the background. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a straight-on perspective level with the scene's horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract animation features a dark, deep-brown background filled with glowing golden elements. At the bottom, a dynamic, wavy surface is composed of countless tiny, shimmering golden particles, creating the appearance of a digital sea or landscape. From a bright, horizontal light source at the horizon of this surface, numerous thin, vertical beams of golden light rise upwards. These beams are accompanied by a multitude of smaller, floating specks of golden light that drift and sparkle throughout the space, with all moving upwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract digital landscape against a dark background, a shimmering golden surface made of countless tiny particles undulates in slow, wave-like motions. A bright, radiant light emanates from the center of this textured ground. From this glowing base, thin, vertical beams of golden light and dotted lines continuously ascend toward the top. Throughout the scene, numerous small, sparkling particles drift and float, rising with the light beams, creating a dynamic and luminous environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
