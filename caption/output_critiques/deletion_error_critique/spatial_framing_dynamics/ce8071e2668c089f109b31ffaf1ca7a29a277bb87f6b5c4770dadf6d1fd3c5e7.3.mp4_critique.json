    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, capturing three people in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of center on the crest of a large red sand dune. A massive rock formation dominates the middle ground on the right, with more mountains receding into the hazy background on the left. The camera, positioned above the subjects, arcs from right to left while simultaneously moving closer to them. This movement transitions the scene into a wide shot, shifting the subjects to the center of the frame. By the end of the shot, the subjects are centrally framed on the dune, with the camera's arcing motion revealing a vast desert valley and mountain range that now fills the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three people with light skin stand together on the crest of a red sand dune. Two men are positioned in the center. The man on the left wears a blue short-sleeved shirt and yellow shorts, while the man next to him wears a dark green long-sleeved shirt and red shorts; both stand with their hands on their hips. To the right of the two men and slightly lower on the dune is a third person, dressed in dark pants and a dark long-sleeved top, with a light-colored head covering and a backpack.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone circles around a vast desert landscape in Wadi Rum, Jordan. The scene features expansive, rolling dunes of reddish-orange sand set against a backdrop of massive, weathered sandstone mountains. Three people stand atop the sharp crest of a high dune, their long shadows stretching across the sand. The drone's movement reveals a wide valley with more mountains receding into a hazy, sunlit atmosphere. The ground is sparsely dotted with small, dry shrubs, and the sky above is pale blue with light clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
