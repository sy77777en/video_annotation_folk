    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young woman in the center foreground. In the background, a large blue neon sign shaped like a city skyline is positioned in the center, with pink neon tubes extending diagonally across the top right. Reddish-brown booths occupy the bottom right middle ground, while metallic fixtures are visible in the middle ground on both the left and right sides of the frame. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with fair skin and short, blonde hair stands facing forward. She is wearing a black and white striped t-shirt layered under a black bomber jacket that has a white collar. Her eyes are wide and her mouth is slightly open, conveying an expression of surprise or apprehension as she looks slightly upward and to her right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors at night within a dimly lit establishment, characterized by a vibrant, high-contrast color scheme. A prominent blue neon sign in the shape of a city skyline dominates the background, complemented by diagonal pink neon tubes. A woman with short blonde hair is positioned in the foreground, standing before reddish-brown booths and metallic fixtures that reflect the colorful lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
