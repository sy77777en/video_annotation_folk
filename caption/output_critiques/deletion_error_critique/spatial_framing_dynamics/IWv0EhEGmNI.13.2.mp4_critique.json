    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, a black shotgun is held in the foreground, occupying the bottom and right portions of the frame and aimed at a wooden door in the center middle ground. An overhead light is positioned at the top center, illuminating the door, while blood splatters are visible on the left wall. The perspective moves forward and then pivots to the left, shifting the view to a dark corridor that now occupies the center of the frame. A figure in military gear becomes visible in the background at the end of this new corridor. The shotgun remains in the foreground, now aimed down the corridor, while a white radiator appears in the foreground on the left. A heads-up display is consistently visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person wearing beige tactical gloves holds a black shotgun equipped with a tactical sight. The scene is set in a dimly lit, narrow hallway with patterned wallpaper marked by red blood splatters. Directly in front is a dark wooden door with a red circular \"no entry\" sign featuring a white rim. Further down the dark corridor, another figure dressed in full military gear, including a helmet and tactical vest, can be seen standing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place in a dimly lit and narrow indoor hallway. The walls feature patterned wallpaper above dark wood wainscoting and are marked with prominent blood splatters and a red streak. At the end of the corridor, a closed wooden door with a \"no entry\" symbol is illuminated by an overhead light. The perspective, holding a black shotgun, moves forward and then turns to peer down an adjacent, darker hallway where a figure is visible in the distance. A white radiator is positioned against the left wall. Overlays are present, including a heads-up display in the bottom right corner showing ammunition counts and weapon icons. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, reading, \"Price: Get that door open, Sergeant!\" Red splotches occasionally appear on the edges of the view, and a white crosshair is centered on the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
