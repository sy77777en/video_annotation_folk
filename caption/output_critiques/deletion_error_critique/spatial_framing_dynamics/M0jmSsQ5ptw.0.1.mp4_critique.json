    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's arm occupies the bottom left foreground, looking down upon a paved area that fills the frame. In the middle ground, a large blue ramp is positioned on the left, a circular target is in the top center, and other smaller ramps are scattered across the center. As the perspective moves forward and descends, the arm exits the frame to the left. Simultaneously, the shadow of a parachutist appears on the ground in the right side of the frame, moving towards the center and bottom as the viewpoint gets closer to the ground. The entire scene on the ground shifts from the top of the frame towards the bottom due to the forward and downward movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's arm, adorned with a yellow wristband and clad in a black and white vertically striped sleeve, is visible in the foreground. The view looks down upon a large, paved concrete area set up as an extreme sports course. The course includes a large blue quarter-pipe, a smaller blue and black ramp, several small black wedge ramps, and a circular landing target with a white outer ring and a black center. As the perspective moves, the distinct shadow of a person attached to a rectangular parachute is cast upon the ground, indicating that the viewpoint is that of a parachutist descending toward the course.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down from a high altitude onto a vast, paved area on a sunny day. The ground, composed of cracked concrete slabs with yellow painted lines, is set up with various ramps and obstacles. On the left, a large blue ramp sits next to a white building. Other smaller black and blue ramps are scattered across the lot, along with a circular white landing target with a black center. The paved area is surrounded by dry, brown earth. As the perspective moves, the shadow of a person attached to a parachute becomes visible on the ground below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
