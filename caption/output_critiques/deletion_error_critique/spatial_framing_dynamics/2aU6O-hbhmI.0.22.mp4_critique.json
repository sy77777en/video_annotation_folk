    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a cityscape construction site. The scene opens from a high-angle perspective, with a large red crane lattice in the left foreground and the active construction site occupying the bottom and center of the frame in the middle ground. A modern high-rise building is positioned in the right middle ground, with other buildings and cranes visible in the background against a colorful sunset sky at the top. The camera then executes a rapid, disorienting rotational movement, tilting upwards and spinning. This motion shifts the perspective from looking down at the ground to looking up at the sky, causing the cityscape and cranes to rotate around the frame, appearing inverted and sideways by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high-angle, first-person perspective that swoops and dives through a large urban construction site. The view is dominated by massive red construction cranes and towering, modern high-rise buildings, all set against a dramatic sunset sky filled with vibrant turquoise, pink, and orange clouds. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vast scale of the urban environment and the energetic atmosphere of development. The camera's acrobatic movement emphasizes the feeling of height and the expansive nature of the city rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a dynamic flight through a dense urban construction site at sunset. The sky is a vibrant mix of turquoise, pink, and orange hues, backdropping numerous modern high-rise buildings and several large construction cranes. One prominent crane, painted red with a lattice structure, is visible alongside other cranes and buildings in various stages of completion. The drone performs rapid dives and rotations, offering sweeping, disorienting views of the cityscape, looking down on the active construction zone with its concrete foundations and up towards the towering structures.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
