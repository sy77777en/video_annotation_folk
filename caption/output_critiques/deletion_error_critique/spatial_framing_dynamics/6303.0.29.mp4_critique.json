    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing eight people on a red sports court. Six individuals form a circle in the middle ground, facing a person in the center, while another stands outside the circle. The camera is positioned above the subjects, providing a top-down view. The scene transitions to a full shot of a basketball, which moves from the middle ground to the foreground, becoming the focal point. The basketball, with a face imprinted on its surface, is centered in the frame. The camera remains above the subject throughout, maintaining a consistent overhead perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features eight people on a red sports court. Six individuals form a circle facing a person in the center, while another person stands outside the circle. A basketball, initially held by a person in the group, becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground, revealing a face imprinted on its surface. This transition highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus from the group interaction to the ball itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor basketball court surrounded by a chain-link fence, set in a park-like environment. The court's surface is a deep red, contrasting with the urban surroundings. The scene takes place during the day, under clear skies, providing bright and even lighting. A group of people is positioned in a circle on the court, engaged in an activity involving a basketball. The basketball is notable for its unique design, featuring a textured surface with a face imprinted on it. The setting is urban, with hints of graffiti visible on nearby structures, adding an element of street art to the environment. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the participants' movements suggesting interaction and play.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and above the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
