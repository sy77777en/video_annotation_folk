    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle medium shot, showing the lower bodies of several figures in the background and top of the frame, standing around a wooden table that occupies the center. In the middle ground, two maps are laid on the table, with a small submarine model positioned in the center of the closer map. A text overlay is visible in the bottom left foreground. The camera then slowly zooms in, causing the figures and the upper map to move out of the frame. The shot transitions into a close-up, maintaining the high-angle perspective, which focuses on the submarine model now centered on the map that fills the entire background. During this transition, the initial text overlay in the bottom left corner is replaced by a new one.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Several static 3D models of men in dark green uniforms stand around a large wooden table. On the table's surface are two large, beige-colored maps with black markings, detailing U.S. Naval Operations in the Pacific Ocean. A small, dark gray model of a submarine, complete with a conning tower and tail fins, is positioned on the map closer to the camera. As the scene's focus shifts to a closer view of this submarine model on the map, the men standing around the table fall out of frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room, several static 3D models in dark green uniforms stand around a large wooden table. Spread across the tabletop are two detailed, vintage-style naval charts titled \"U.S. NAVAL OPERATIONS PACIFIC OCEAN AREAS WORLD WAR II.\" The maps, rendered in black ink on off-white paper, depict various islands and sea routes. A small, dark gray model of a submarine is positioned on the lower map, which shows locations such as the Philippine Islands and the Solomon Islands. The scene slowly zooms in on the submarine model. An overlay text in the bottom left corner initially appears with shifting letters, eventually spelling out \"USS HALIBUT,\" after which it remains static for the duration of the video. Additionally, there is another overlay watermark in the very bottom left corner of the video that reads \"[6] geographicus.com.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows several humanoid subjects gathered around a table with two maps placed on it. One of the maps has a submarine model on it. Initially, only parts of the humanoid subjects’ bodies are visible, appearing in varying sizes. The camera then moves closer to the table, focusing on the submarine model on the map, and ultimately presenting a full shot of the submarine model.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
