    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide, low-angle shot of a man standing on a balcony in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The building's concrete overhang occupies the top of the frame, with the sky visible in the background. The camera then zooms in, transitioning to a full shot of the man. In the final framing, he remains in the center, while the balcony railing he leans on moves into the foreground at the bottom of the frame, with the low-angle perspective maintained throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with short hair and facial hair stands on a balcony, looking down toward the camera. He wears a black jacket with white text printed on the chest and shoulders, along with light-colored pants. He leans forward, resting one hand on the balcony's railing while waving with the other hand. His mouth is open as if he is speaking or rapping.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle shot looks up at the exterior of a multi-story building under an overcast sky. The architecture is defined by an angular, beige concrete overhang that creates a covered balcony on the top floor, which is the third level. The building's facade consists of this textured concrete and a lower section of brown brick. The balcony features a solid, dark grey panel at its base with a black metal railing on top. A man is visible standing on the balcony. A circular light fixture is mounted on the underside of the concrete overhang.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
