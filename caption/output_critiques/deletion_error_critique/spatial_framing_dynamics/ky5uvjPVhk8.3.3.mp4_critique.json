    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a serene landscape in a Japanese garden. In the first part, the reflective body of water occupies the foreground, with large rocks partially submerged on the right. Lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage frame the pond on the left and right, while buildings rise in the background, adding an urban contrast. The camera is positioned at a height that captures the water and the skyline, emphasizing the harmony between nature and urban elements. In the second part, the camera transitions to a stone pathway leading over a small bridge, positioned in the center and foreground. The pathway is flanked by rocks and vibrant trees, with the garden extending into the background. The camera remains at a height that showcases the pathway and surrounding foliage, maintaining a focus on the garden's natural beauty.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a serene landscape scenery shot capturing a tranquil park setting. It features a reflective body of water bordered by lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage, with trees displaying shades of red, orange, and green. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a warm, golden light over the scene, enhancing the colors and creating a peaceful atmosphere. In the background, a few buildings rise above the treetops, adding an urban contrast to the natural beauty. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the harmony between nature and urban elements rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot captures a serene outdoor setting in a Japanese garden during the late afternoon. The scene features a tranquil pond reflecting the golden hues of the sky and surrounding buildings, which are bathed in warm sunlight. The water is calm, with a few large rocks partially submerged, adding texture to the scene. Lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage in shades of red and orange frame the pond, creating a picturesque landscape. A stone pathway leads over a small stone bridge, inviting exploration of the garden's natural beauty. The sky is partly cloudy, with soft, diffused light enhancing the peaceful atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
