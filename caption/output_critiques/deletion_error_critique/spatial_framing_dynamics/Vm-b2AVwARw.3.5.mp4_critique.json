The hand and phone remain stationary against a blurred, neutral-toned background.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, light-skinned cartoon hand holds a black smartphone horizontally. The phone's white screen displays a series of interactive educational lessons from an app, starting with its logo, the word \"Brilliant,\" which is initially written in green ink following the stroke order before changing to black text. The content on the screen then cycles through various animated and interactive modules. An initial module is labeled \"Exterior Angles.\" Another module demonstrates gear rotation with blue, grey, and yellow gears. A different module shows a diagram related to pattern recognition, with shapes connected to a grid where a diagonal line is being drawn. A lesson on probability lists topics like \"Uniform Probabilities\" and \"Intro to Simulation.\" Another module displays a scatter plot with a blue parabolic curve and interactive sliders, followed by a multiple-choice question about the model. A lesson illustrates GPS location with a graphic of the Earth and a satellite's signal sphere. A final example shows a scatter plot demonstrating \"Mean Squared Error\" with data on penguin weight versus bill depth. A cursor arrow is visible interacting with the on-screen elements, such as sliders and buttons.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a softly lit setting with a blurred, neutral-toned background, a stylized, cartoon-like hand holds a black smartphone horizontally. The video displays a series of educational application contents on the phone's screen. Initially, the word \"Brilliant\" appears as a logo. The display then transitions through various interactive lessons, starting with an \"exterior angles\" lesson, followed by animated diagrams of gear rotations, a visual representation of a neural network, a menu for a probability course, a scatter plot with a parabolic curve, an animated model of GPS location relative to the Earth, and a graph demonstrating mean squared error. These contents feature clean graphics, charts, and interactive elements like sliders and multiple-choice questions. A white rectangular overlay with black text reading \"AD\" is visible in the top right corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
