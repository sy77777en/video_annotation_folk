    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame. The shot begins with significant motion blur as she holds her hands over her face in the foreground. The camera then appears to pull back slightly or stabilize, reducing the blur, while the woman remains centered. She lowers her hands from her face to her chest level and begins clapping. Throughout the shot, a blurry, arid landscape with dry bushes occupies the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A fair-skinned woman with blonde hair is shown in a close-up. She wears a white, cable-knit beanie. Initially, her hands cover her mouth, and then she starts clapping with both hands. On her left wrist, she wears a black bracelet, and on her right wrist, she has a red wristband along with a black bracelet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors in a dry, arid environment under natural daylight. The ground consists of light brown dirt and sand, with sparse, dry bushes scattered across the landscape. A blurry, sandy hillside forms the background. The shot is characterized by significant motion blur, suggesting rapid movement within the scene. A person wearing a light-colored knit beanie is visible in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
