    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot looking up at an ornate ceiling that occupies the top half of the frame, with two chandeliers hanging in the middle ground on the left and right. The camera tilts downward, revealing a large, arched window in the center background and a staircase in the foreground. This movement reveals a woman, transitioning the frame to a medium shot of her from a high angle. In the final composition, the woman is positioned in the center foreground on a mosaic-tiled landing, framed by staircase balustrades on the left and right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a focus on an ornate ceiling featuring intricate patterns and two hanging chandeliers, suggesting an elegant interior space. As the scene progresses, the camera or subject movement reveals a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a brown coat and carrying a black bag. She is descending a staircase, facing away from the camera, towards a tiled floor with a decorative design. The transition from the ceiling to the woman highlights the grandeur of the setting and her movement within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, begins by looking up at an ornate, coffered ceiling inside a grand, dimly lit hall. Two large, bowl-shaped chandeliers with dark metalwork hang from the ceiling, illuminating decorative friezes with inscriptions along the upper walls. The view tilts down to reveal a large, arched window framed by a string of small, bright lights. Through the window panes, a street scene with a parked car is visible in the evening light. The perspective continues downward, showing a wide staircase with marble-like balustrades leading to a landing with an intricate mosaic tile floor, where a person with blonde hair is seen from behind.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
