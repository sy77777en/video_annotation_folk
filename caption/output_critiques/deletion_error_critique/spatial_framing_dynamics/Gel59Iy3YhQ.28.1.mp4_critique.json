    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from a first-person point-of-view, looking up from underneath a large, white, curved structure that occupies the top and right portions of the frame. The structure extends from the immediate foreground on the right, sweeping upwards and into the middle ground towards the center. A held white block is visible in the foreground at the bottom right. The background consists of a light blue sky on the left and a distant landscape visible far below in the bottom center. Several UI elements are overlaid in the foreground: an inventory bar at the bottom center, prompts in the bottom left and right corners, a character avatar in the top left, and a crosshair in the center. The camera, positioned below the main structure, subtly pans left and tilts down, centering the crosshair on a block before another white block is placed in the foreground, extending the structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a first-person perspective from the video game Minecraft, focusing on the construction of a large structure high in the sky. The structure is made of smooth, white blocks and is built in a stepped, layered fashion, creating a sweeping arc. The player appears well-prepared to actively add to the structure, as seen from the viewpoint of holding a white block. At the bottom of the screen, an inventory bar displays a selection of available blocks, including white, light blue, diamond, red, and black blocks. In the top-left corner, a small avatar of the player character is visible, showing a figure with light skin, brown hair, a green shirt, and dark grey pants.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a scene high in the sky of a Minecraft world. The view looks up along the underside of a massive structure made of white blocks. Far below, a flat landscape with some trees is visible. A light blue sky with blocky clouds can be seen behind and above the structure. Overlays are present on the screen. In the bottom center, an inventory hotbar displays various colored blocks, with the white block selected, next to an \"Inventory\" prompt in the bottom left. In the bottom right, controller prompts for actions like \"Drop\" and \"Emote\" are visible. A small character icon is in the top left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
