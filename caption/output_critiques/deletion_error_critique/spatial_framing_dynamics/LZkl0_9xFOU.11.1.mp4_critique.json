    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a black video game console is positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the bottom left to the top right. The front face of the console occupies the center and right foreground, with its illuminated logo located on the bottom right. The top surface is visible across the top of the frame, while a portion of its left side is seen in the left foreground. The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot shows a black Xbox One video game console. The console has a rectangular shape with a matte finish on its front panel and a glossy, vented top surface. On the right side of the front face, the circular white Xbox logo is illuminated. The console is lit by a cool, greenish-toned light, creating a bright highlight along the top edge and casting the rest of the device in deep shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a black video game console with a rectangular shape rests on a matte gray surface. The console features a combination of matte and glossy black finishes. A cool, greenish light from an unseen source illuminates the top edge of the device, revealing a pattern of vents. On the front right side, a circular white Xbox logo is brightly lit.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
