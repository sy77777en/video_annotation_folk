    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a single matchstick is positioned vertically in the center of the frame and in the foreground against a black background. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout. The match ignites, and a bright flame briefly expands to fill the frame before settling into a steady, teardrop-shaped flame that burns upwards from the centrally located match head. As the flame burns, the match head remains stationary in the center foreground. The flame eventually extinguishes, and a thin wisp of smoke rises vertically from the charred head in the center of the frame before dissipating, leaving the burnt matchstick in its original central position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up of a single matchstick with a red, granular head on a light-colored wooden stick is shown. The matchstick ignites in a bright flash, and its head is consumed by a steady, teardrop-shaped flame that is yellow-orange with a blue base. As the flame burns, the head transforms into a black, porous, and charred mass. The flame eventually goes out, leaving the burnt, blackened head, from which a thin wisp of white smoke briefly rises.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a close-up shot captures a matchstick with a red head. The match ignites in a bright flash, which then settles into a steady, orange-yellow flame with a blue base. As the flame burns, the head of the match transforms into a black, porous, charred substance. The flame eventually extinguishes, leaving the burnt tip to release a faint wisp of smoke.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
