    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a boy, filmed at his level. The boy is consistently positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. Initially, his head is tilted back with eyes closed as he holds a watermelon slice. A tray laden with watermelon slices occupies the foreground, extending from the bottom left towards the center. In the blurred background, a chair is visible to the left, another chair to the right, and a green cabinet further to the right. The primary dynamic within the static frame occurs as the boy opens his eyes wide, his gaze shifting towards the left of the frame, while his overall position and the arrangement of other elements remain unchanged.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young, light-skinned boy with short, dark brown hair styled in a bowl cut with an undercut. He is wearing a white collared shirt under a dark green knitted vest. Initially, the boy tilts his head back with his eyes open, holding the watermelon slice in both hands, ready to take a big bite. Just before biting, he briefly closes his eyes. Subsequently, his eyes are wide open, revealing large, dark pupils, and they glance off to the left, while his mouth is agape in a surprised or shocked expression, still holding the watermelon slice. In front of him, on a light-colored tray, are several other bright red watermelon slices with green rinds and black seeds.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, likely in a dining area or kitchen, with a light-colored table in the foreground. On the table, a light khaki-colored rectangular tray holds several bright red, sliced pieces of watermelon with green rinds and black seeds. In the blurred background, a chair with a high back is visible to the left, and another similar chair is to the right. A light green cabinet or piece of furniture can be seen behind and to the right of the similarly styled chair on the right. The room is illuminated by soft, natural-looking light, suggesting daytime, with light streaming in from a window out of view, casting soft shadows.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
