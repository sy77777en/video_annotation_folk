    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is framed from a subject-level perspective, with a grassy lawn occupying the foreground. A leafless tree stands in the left foreground, while a shadow extends from the bottom right. In the middle ground, a road with moving cars stretches horizontally across the frame. On the sidewalk, a man walks from the center-left towards the right. Simultaneously, a woman walks from the center towards the left, while on the right side, another woman and two children move left across a crosswalk. The background is composed of leafless trees and multi-story buildings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground, a grassy area features a prominent leafless tree on the left. The midground shows a paved road with cars moving in both directions. On the sidewalk beyond the road, a man walks to the right, while a woman and two children on scooters move to the left. In the background, more pedestrians, leafless trees, traffic lights, and multi-story brick buildings are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a late afternoon in an urban area from a slightly shaky and panning viewpoint across a sunlit green lawn. In the foreground, a leafless tree with a light-brown trunk stands on the left, while a long shadow stretches across the grass from the right. A multi-lane road with white markings carries moving traffic, including several cars and a white truck. A few pedestrians walk along the sidewalk and use a crosswalk at an intersection equipped with traffic lights. In the background, bare trees line the street in front of multi-story, red-brick buildings under a pale blue sky with light clouds. The low sun casts a warm, golden glow over the entire setting.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
