    "pre_caption": "Initially, a person, shown from the shoulders up, is in the bottom left foreground, with a red fire hydrant to their immediate right in the foreground. A red sedan is in the left middle ground, partially behind the person, and a yellow street sign on a pole is also in the left middle ground. A paved street extends from the bottom left to the top right through the middle ground, with a park-like area containing trees and a low stone wall in the right background. As the camera pans left, these elements move towards the right and out of view. A man, shown in full body, enters from the left, settling in the center foreground. A tree with pink blossoms becomes visible in the left foreground. The street then occupies the middle ground, stretching towards the top right, while the park area is in the right background, with streetlights and distant buildings in the far background. The camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video first shows a person with short, bright pink hair, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a black face mask that covers their nose and mouth. This individual, with a light skin tone, is visible from the shoulders up, dressed in a black outfit with a brown jacket over it, and faces towards the camera. As the camera pans left, a man with short, dark hair comes into view. He is seen in full body, wearing black pants and a white shirt underneath a khaki jacket. He turns almost halfway, so most of his body faces the camera, but he is still slightly turned away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Captured from an objective perspective, the video shows an outdoor scene at dusk or early evening under a light blue sky. A paved street with white lane markings runs alongside a park-like area. On the sidewalk, a person with pink hair, wearing black glasses and a black face mask, stands near a red fire hydrant. A red sedan is parked at the curb. A yellow street sign is mounted on a dark pole. The adjacent green space features numerous trees, some bare-branched and others displaying light green spring foliage, and is bordered by a low stone wall. As the camera pans to the left, a lush tree adorned with pink blossoms comes into view on the left side of the frame. Streetlights are visible, and buildings are discernible in the distance.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video mainly shows a street scene, with humans included. Initially, a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask shows their shoulders and above. The camera then pans left, revealing the full body of a man in light-colored clothing.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
