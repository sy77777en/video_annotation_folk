    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a man with blonde hair is positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is in sharp focus as he speaks, slightly turning his head toward the camera's perspective. Occupying the right side of the frame, the out-of-focus back and shoulder of a second person are visible in the foreground. The background is dark and indistinct. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man of East Asian descent with short, bleached blonde hair is shown in a close-up view, looking initially to the left of the frame before turning to face the person in front of him. He has dark eyes and wears small hoop earrings in both ears. His mouth is moving as he speaks. In the foreground and out of focus is the back of another person's head and shoulder. This second person is wearing a light blue top with a collar and is being addressed by the first man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the setting is a dimly lit, dark environment. A young man with short, bleached-blonde hair and small hoop earrings in each ear is in focus, speaking to the individual whose back is to the camera. The focused, low-key lighting illuminates the speaker's face, while the background is indistinct and shrouded in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
