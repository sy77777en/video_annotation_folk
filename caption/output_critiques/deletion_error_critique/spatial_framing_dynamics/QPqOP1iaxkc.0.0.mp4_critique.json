    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide, static scenery shot framed symmetrically from within a bridge's steel truss structure. An overhead beam with graffiti is positioned in the top foreground, while the bridge's supports create a repeating pattern on the left and right, extending from the foreground into the background. Centered in the frame, a subway train travels from the middle ground toward the camera on tracks that run down the middle of the scene. To the left and right of the tracks, roadways with cars are visible in the middle ground, flanked by pink railings. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down the length of the bridge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scenery shot from a static, symmetrical viewpoint within the light-blue steel truss structure of a bridge. A subway train with illuminated headlights travels towards the camera on tracks that run down the center of the frame, while cars are visible on roadways to both the left and right. The intricate, riveted beams of the bridge, one of which is marked with blue graffiti, create a powerful sense of depth and industrial geometry, complemented by the pink railings lining the walkways on either side. The focus is on the grand scale and atmosphere of the urban infrastructure rather than a specific subject; the approaching train is an integral part of the environment, emphasizing the bridge's function and the city's constant motion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective within the framework of the Williamsburg Bridge in New York City, the view looks straight down its length on a bright, sunny day. The light-blue steel truss structure, detailed with rivets, creates a repeating, symmetrical pattern, with an overhead beam marked by blue graffiti. In the center, a silver subway train with a yellow front travels on a set of tracks, moving toward the camera's position. Flanking the tracks are roadways with vehicle traffic, and the outer edges of the bridge are lined with pink safety fencing. The bright sunlight casts strong, linear shadows across the entire scene, which extends into the distance toward the city skyline.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
