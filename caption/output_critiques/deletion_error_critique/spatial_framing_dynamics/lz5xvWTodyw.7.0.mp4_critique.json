    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of an industrial corridor. The corridor is centrally framed, extending from the foreground deep into the background and creating a strong sense of linear perspective as it recedes into a hazy, dark vanishing point. A series of doors and lights are positioned symmetrically along the left and right walls, starting in the middle ground and continuing into the background. In the foreground and middle ground, various pieces of industrial equipment are placed along the walls: a pallet jack is in the bottom left foreground, another is on the right in the middle ground, and boxes are on the left. The camera is positioned at an eye-level height, offering a straight-on view down the length of the hallway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an industrial corridor scenery shot depicting a long, straight hallway receding into a hazy, dark distance. The environment is bathed in an eerie, dim white light emanating from fixtures mounted above a series of identical white doors that line the cinder block walls. The light casts reflections on the dark, smooth floor, where yellow safety markings are visible, and industrial equipment, including pallet jacks and stacked boxes, are scattered in the shadows along the sides. There is no main subject in the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down a long, dark indoor corridor. The walls are made of painted cinder blocks with a greenish hue, and pipes run along the ceiling, with the hallway stretching into a hazy, indistinct distance. The scene is illuminated by a series of wall-mounted lights, each positioned above a white door, casting cones of white light onto the dark, reflective floor. The doors are arranged symmetrically on both sides of the hall, and several pallet jacks are positioned intermittently along the walls.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
