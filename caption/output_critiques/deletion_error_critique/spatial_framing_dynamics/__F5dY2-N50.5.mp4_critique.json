    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a tropical garden scene. Initially, the frame is composed with a paved patio in the bottom foreground, where a round, glass-topped table is positioned in the bottom right. A path of dark stepping stones on white sand begins at the bottom center and extends into the middle ground, passing a large tree trunk located in the center-right. A low, off-white wall runs along the left side of the frame, while dense green foliage occupies the middle ground and fills the background. The camera then performs a slow pan to the right combined with a slight upward tilt. This movement shifts the framing, cropping the table in the bottom right and revealing more of the foliage in the upper portion of the frame. The final perspective is slightly more elevated, offering a fuller view of the garden path and the surrounding greenery from a camera height that is approximately eye-level relative to the patio.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a serene garden scene at a tropical resort, viewed from a paved patio area. A pathway of dark grey, rectangular stepping stones is set into fine white sand, extending away from the viewer and passing by the side of a large, gnarled tree with a dark brown trunk. The scene is framed by low, off-white walls and an abundance of lush, green tropical foliage, creating a sense of secluded privacy. The video focuses on the overall environment—the interplay of natural elements like sand and plants with modern design—to convey a feeling of a peaceful escape, emphasizing tranquility and immersion in nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an open patio, a view opens onto a secluded garden path during the daytime. A series of rectangular, dark gray stone slabs are set into white sand, creating a walkway that leads away from the viewer. The path is bordered on the left by a low, off-white wall and is surrounded by dense, green tropical foliage, including various plants and a large tree with a prominent, gnarled trunk. A dark, round pot sits next to the farthest stone of the path. In the foreground to the right, a round, dark-colored table with a glass top holds a small, white, square box. The camera pans and tilts, adjusting the frame to offer different perspectives of the garden.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
