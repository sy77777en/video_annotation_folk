    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot captured from an aerial perspective, two silhouetted figures are positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing in the middle ground on a wide beach. In the background, the sun is visible on the left, low on the horizon over the ocean, which extends to a distant headland on the right. Wet sand reflecting the sky surrounds the figures in the middle ground, while dry sand with tire tracks occupies the foreground and right side of the frame. A white, smoke-like effect drifts across the bottom right foreground. The smaller figure moves around the taller, more stationary figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A taller person and a smaller person, likely a child, are silhouetted on a wide, wet beach at sunset. The taller individual, wearing dark clothing, stands with their arms raised in a playful or celebratory gesture. The smaller child, who appears to be wearing lighter-colored clothing, is positioned near the taller person and moves around them on the sand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a wide, sandy beach at sunrise or sunset. The sun is low on the horizon, casting a golden glow across the calm ocean and creating a bright reflection on the water's surface. The sky transitions from yellow near the sun to a clear blue. The expansive beach is covered in wet, dark sand, which reflects the sky and the sun. Tire tracks are visible in the sand, and shallow tidal pools curve along the shoreline. In the distance, a dark headland sits under a layer of clouds. Two silhouetted figures are visible near the water's edge. A white, smoke-like visual effect drifts across the lower right portion of the scene, partially obscuring the sand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
