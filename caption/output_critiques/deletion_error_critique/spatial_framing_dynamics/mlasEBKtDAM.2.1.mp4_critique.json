    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle medium shot of several giant, muscular figures against a clouded sky. A central figure occupies the middle ground, with another to its left and one to its right, while more figures are visible in the background, and an explosion occurs in the top right. The shot then tilts down to a low-angle wide shot, revealing a harbor in the foreground and middle ground, with the lower bodies of the giant figures now towering in the background. In this new composition, a seaplane is positioned on the water in the bottom left foreground, a dock and buildings are in the left middle ground, and a ship is moored in the right middle ground, all positioned below the advancing giant figures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several colossal humanoid figures with exposed muscles and no skin, towering over a cityscape. The main subject is a central giant, distinguished by its massive size and prominent muscular structure, standing upright with a forward-facing posture. Surrounding this figure are other similar giants, each displaying the same muscular appearance, with a fluid, similar in color to the muscles, flowing from their heads, contributing to a sense of overwhelming scale. In the foreground, a harbor with a docked ship and industrial buildings is visible, emphasizing the contrast between the giants and the human-made structures. The scene conveys a dramatic juxtaposition of the immense figures against the smaller, detailed city elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a dramatic outdoor scene set during the day, featuring a group of colossal figures with exposed muscle structures, towering over a landscape. The sky is filled with large, fluffy clouds with patches of blue visible behind them. The figures are positioned near a waterfront area with a dock, where a ship is moored. The dock is lined with buildings featuring red-tiled roofs and industrial elements, suggesting a port setting. Splashes are visible next to the boat, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The overall atmosphere combines natural and industrial features, with the massive figures dominating the skyline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
