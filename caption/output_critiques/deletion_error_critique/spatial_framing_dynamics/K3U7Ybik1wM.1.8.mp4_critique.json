    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a high angle. Initially, a wet stone patio with a transparent geometric overlay occupies the foreground and bottom half of the frame, with a potted plant in the bottom left and another in the bottom right. The middle ground is composed of a green lawn, a low stone wall to the left, and a wooden fence running horizontally. In the background, two horses are visible in a pasture, with a line of trees at the horizon under a cloudy sky. The camera then tilts directly downwards, shifting the composition to a top-down view that focuses exclusively on the stone pavers of the patio, which now fill the entire frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a countryside scenery shot, focusing on the atmosphere of a quiet, rural setting rather than a specific subject. The view begins from a wet, flagstone patio, looking out over a vibrant green lawn towards a wooden-fenced pasture where two brown horses graze among yellow wildflowers under a cloudy sky. The camera then noticeably shakes as it tilts down, shifting the focus from the pastoral landscape to the detailed, irregular pattern of the damp, weathered stones of the patio itself. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to absorb the tranquil environment and the textures of the natural and man-made elements within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out from a wet stone patio onto a rural landscape under an overcast sky. The camera tilts down to focus on the large, irregular stone pavers of the patio, which are marked with a transparent, dark geometric overlay. Two potted plants, one in a blue-green ceramic pot and the other in a terracotta pot, sit on the patio at the edge of a lush green lawn. A low stone wall stands to the left, next to a small shed and a light green spherical tank. In the background, a wooden fence encloses a large field dotted with yellow wildflowers, where two brown horses are visible grazing in the distance before a line of trees.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
