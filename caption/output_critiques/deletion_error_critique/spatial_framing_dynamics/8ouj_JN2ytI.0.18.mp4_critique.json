    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot where a large group of police officers collectively occupies the central area of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground and background as they move forward through a dimly lit tunnel. Small yellow lights are visible on the left wall in the middle ground, and white circular lights are spaced along the ceiling, receding from the middle ground into the background. The dark tunnel walls are positioned on both the left and right sides of the frame. The group advances from the foreground deeper into the tunnel towards the background, then abruptly stops and turns around. The camera is positioned above the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a large group of police officers, mostly men, walking forward in a dimly lit, narrow, enclosed space. Many are dressed in dark uniforms, with some wearing police hats or helmets. The word \"POLICE\" is visible in white capital letters on the back of at least one officer's uniform, and \"GCPD\" can be seen on the back of another. The officers are clustered together, moving in the same direction until they all suddenly stop and turn around at the end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a large group of people, many in dark uniforms with some identifiable as police, moving through a long, dimly lit indoor tunnel. The tunnel features dark, possibly concrete walls, with small, yellow lights mounted at intervals on one side. A series of brighter, white, circular lights are spaced along the dark ceiling, extending into the receding darkness. The densely packed crowd advances deeper into the tunnel.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
