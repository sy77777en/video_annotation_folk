    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. From a static, high-elevation, level-angle perspective, a rocky cliff edge occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The vast, layered canyon fills the middle ground across the lower half of the composition, extending into the background. Heavy, dark clouds dominate the top half of the frame. In the middle ground, sheets of rain are visible falling from the clouds into the canyon, primarily in the center and left portions of the scene. The time-lapse captures the rapid movement of the clouds and rain across the expansive landscape, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow over the static canyon formations.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot from a horizontal perspective, capturing a vast, layered canyon under a turbulent sky. The scene is dominated by a powerful storm, with heavy, dark clouds filling the upper frame and casting deep shadows across the reddish-brown rock formations. Visible sheets of rain fall from the clouds into the depths of the canyon, while distant areas are illuminated by shafts of sunlight, creating a high-contrast and moody atmosphere. There is no main subject in this shot; the focus is instead on the immense scale of the natural environment and the powerful, atmospheric weather conditions unfolding within it. The sheer size and grandeur of the landscape are emphasized by the expansive view and the dynamic interplay of light and shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a dramatic storm moving across the Grand Canyon. From a level angle, the view looks out over the vast expanse of layered, reddish-brown rock formations and buttes. The sky is filled with heavy, dark grey clouds, from which sheets of rain fall into the canyon in the distance. The rapid movement of the clouds and rain creates a dynamic scene, with shifting light and shadow over the immense landscape. In the foreground, a portion of a rocky, arid cliff edge is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
