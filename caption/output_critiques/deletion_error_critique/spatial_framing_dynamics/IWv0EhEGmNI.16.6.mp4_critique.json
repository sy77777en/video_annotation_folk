    "pre_caption": "The video employs a medium close-up shot, with a man positioned in the right foreground, facing towards the left. A woman, seen primarily from her back, occupies the left foreground, facing the man. In the dimly lit background, several out-of-focus figures are visible, distributed across the center-left and center-right. Green subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video primarily focuses on a man positioned in front of a woman, engaged in a conversation. The man wears a dark-colored beanie, a dark green tactical jacket, and a tactical vest with \"G-25\" printed on it. He has a prominent dark brown mustache and beard, and light skin. He is holding a rifle and looking towards the woman. The woman, seen mostly from her back, has blonde hair styled in a neat bun and is wearing a light-colored, possibly white or very light grey, collared shirt or jacket. She is facing the man. In the dimly lit background, several other figures in military-style attire are visible but are out of focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character with blonde hair in a bun and a light-colored shirt, looks towards another character. The scene is set outdoors at night in a moderately lit, open area, with indistinct vehicles and figures in the background. The character facing the camera is a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a tactical vest with \"G-25\" printed on it. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom, displaying dialogue with names in green and text in white: \"Price: To who?\", \"Laswell: Russia.\", and \"Price: Prisoner swap?\". The overall atmosphere is dark, with focused lighting on the two main characters.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
