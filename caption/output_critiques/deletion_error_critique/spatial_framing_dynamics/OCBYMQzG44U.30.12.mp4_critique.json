    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot of an empty room. The video begins with the camera positioned at a low angle in the right foreground, partially behind a white-tiled wall. The view looks across a large, tiled floor that occupies the bottom half of the frame, with a black and white geometric pattern in the middle ground. In the background, dark walls line the space, and an arched doorway is visible slightly left of center. The camera then performs a quick pan to the right, revealing more of the room. This movement shifts the arched doorway to the center-left background and brings a curved wall on the right side of the room into view, which extends from the middle ground to the right edge of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a large, sterile, and empty room, captured with a panning and moving forward motion that reveals more of the space. The floor is covered in small white tiles, with a rectangular area of white tiles framed by black tiles in the center. The lower portion of the walls is a dark, textured material, while the upper walls and ceiling are white, illuminated by several small circular white lights and one large, circular light fixture. An arched doorway is visible in the back wall. There is no main subject; the focus is entirely on the unsettling, liminal atmosphere and the stark, geometric design of the environment itself, making the empty space the point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a large, sterile room under the glow of circular ceiling lights that cast a greenish-yellow hue. The floor is composed of small white tiles, with a large, white-tiled rectangle framed by glossy black tiles. The lower half of the walls are a dark, textured material, contrasting with the white upper walls and ceiling. An arched doorway is visible in the distance. The perspective pans quickly to the right, revealing more of the empty, tiled space.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
