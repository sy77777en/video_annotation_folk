    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot filmed at the subject's level. Initially, a man's hand is positioned in the center of the frame, holding a white egg inside a black frying pan in the middle ground. The man's torso is visible in the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame. To the right of the pan, an egg carton sits in the middle ground, while on the left, a jar of white substance on a blue cloth and a spice shaker are also in the middle ground. The entire scene is set on a wooden table that fills the bottom half of the frame. In a slow-motion sequence, the hand in the center opens, causing the egg to shatter. Pieces of white shell and yellow yolk explode outwards from the center, splattering across the pan and the surrounding table. The man's open hand remains suspended in the center of the frame above the broken egg.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man, visible from the chest up and wearing a patterned t-shirt, holds a white egg inside a black frying pan on a wooden table. His right hand, adorned with a silver ring, is initially clenched with the back facing upward, hovering above the egg. In slow motion, his hand suddenly opens, causing the egg to crack apart and pieces of white shell and yellow yolk to splatter both inside and outside the pan. To the right of the pan is a grey cardboard egg carton containing several more white eggs. To the left, a clear plastic container filled with a white granular substance sits on a folded blue cloth, with a yellow-capped spice shaker partially visible behind it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is set at a wooden table against a dark background. On the table sits a black frying pan, a cardboard carton of white eggs, a clear jar filled with a white granular substance resting on a blue cloth, and a spice shaker with a yellow cap. A person's right hand, adorned with a silver ring, is positioned above the eggs with the back of the hand facing upward. In a swift motion, the hand opens, causing a single white egg to crack open. The egg shatters in slow motion, scattering white shell fragments and yellow yolk both inside and outside the pan.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
