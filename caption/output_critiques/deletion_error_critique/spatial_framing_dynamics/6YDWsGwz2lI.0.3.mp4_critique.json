    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a cityscape, capturing towering skyscrapers that dominate the frame. The buildings are positioned primarily in the left and right sections, creating a canyon-like effect as they rise vertically. The left side includes a light fixture positioned in the foreground, while the right side showcases a mix of modern and classical architectural styles in the middle ground. The sky, visible in the top portion of the frame, adds depth with its partly cloudy appearance. The camera is positioned slightly below the height of the buildings, emphasizing their scale and height. Throughout the video, the shot remains static, maintaining the same spatial composition without any noticeable changes in framing or position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a view of towering skyscrapers with a focus on the vertical lines and architectural details of the buildings. The perspective emphasizes the height and scale of the urban environment, with the sky visible between the structures, adding depth. The lighting highlights the textures and shadows on the buildings, creating an atmospheric urban scene. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the grandeur and complexity of the cityscape itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an urban setting with towering skyscrapers lining a narrow street, creating a canyon-like effect. The scene is outdoors, set in a cityscape with tall buildings featuring numerous windows and a mix of modern and classical architectural styles. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused light casting long shadows. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible between the clouds. Notable visual elements include the vertical lines of the buildings, the texture of the stone and glass facades, and a prominent light fixture on the left side, which adds a warm glow to the otherwise cool-toned environment. The scene remains static, with no visible movement or changes, maintaining a calm and serene atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
