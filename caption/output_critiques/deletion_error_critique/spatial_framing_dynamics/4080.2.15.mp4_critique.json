    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a young man is positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center, occupying the foreground. The background consists of blurry, sunlit foliage with prominent bokeh, creating a shallow depth of field. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and maintains a soft focus on him as he moves slightly within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with a light skin tone is shown in a medium close-up shot. He has short, shaggy black hair with a light blue streak in his bangs. He wears round, dark sunglasses and a gold chain necklace. His attire consists of a red and black horizontally striped sweater. Throughout the video, his mouth is open, showing his teeth, as if he is singing or shouting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene is set in a sunlit, wooded area, characterized by a shallow depth of field that renders the background foliage into a soft, blurry wash of green and blue tones with prominent bokeh. In the foreground, a person with dark hair featuring a blue streak wears a red and black striped sweater, a gold-colored chain, and round sunglasses. The natural light filters through the trees, creating a hazy, atmospheric quality.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
