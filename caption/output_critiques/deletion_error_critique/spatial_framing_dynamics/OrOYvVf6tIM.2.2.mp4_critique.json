    "pre_caption": "This is a static full shot of a man, framed through a dark doorway in the foreground. The man stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of the room. In front of him, also in the middle ground, is a coffee table. Behind him, a sofa is positioned in the middle ground against the back wall. The background consists of the back wall, which features a lit lamp on the left, a stereo system on the right, and artwork. The camera remains stationary at the man's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man, who appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s, stands in the middle of a living room. He has short, dark hair and a short beard. He is wearing a blue, long-sleeved shirt with dark sleeves and dark-colored pants. Throughout the video, he holds an open, medium-sized cardboard box in front of him with both hands, looking around the room with a serious expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit living room, viewed from a dark doorway. The room features light yellow walls with a darker, paneled upper section. A gray sofa is positioned against the back wall, fronted by a white coffee table holding a decorative bowl. Some red items are on the gray sofa. Warm light is cast by a table lamp with a circular base and a drum shade. To the right of the sofa, a tall shelving unit contains numerous media cases and a stereo system. The room has hardwood floors, a patterned area rug, and framed artwork on the walls. A man wearing a dark and blue shirt and pants stands in the middle of the room holding an open cardboard box.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
