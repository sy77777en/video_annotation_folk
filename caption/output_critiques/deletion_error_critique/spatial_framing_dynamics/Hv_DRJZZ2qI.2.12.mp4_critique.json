    "pre_caption": "Initially, a medium full shot frames the main subject, a man in a green and yellow shirt, in the center-left foreground, partially facing towards the right. A pregnant woman stands in the center-right middle ground, interacting with him, while another man with a backpack is positioned in the right middle ground, slightly behind her. A brown dog is visible in the bottom-left foreground. In the left middle ground, two other women stand on a dirt path that extends from the foreground, with reddish-brown rocky hills occupying the background. As the main subject turns his back to the camera, he moves to the center foreground, and the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing on his upper body from behind. Consequently, the pregnant woman is now positioned in the center-left middle ground, while the other elements largely maintain their relative positions. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with short brown hair and a beard, wearing a green and yellow long-sleeved athletic shirt with \"ZINK\" in yellow lettering on the back and \"Troy Lee Designs\" on the sleeve. He has goggles with a red and white strap around his neck. He is interacting with a pregnant woman who has long blonde hair and is wearing a light grey beanie, a black top under an open blue zip-up hoodie, and grey pants. Standing behind the pregnant woman is another man wearing a black t-shirt, a black baseball cap, sunglasses, and a large grey and black backpack. A medium-sized brown dog on a leash is visible near the group. Further in the background, two other women are standing on a dirt path; one wears a black top and grey jeans, and the other wears a dark top, light green pants, and a green cap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a rugged, arid landscape characterized by reddish-brown, rocky hills and sparse, dry vegetation under a bright, white sky. A dirt path winds through the terrain, where a group of people are gathered. In the foreground, a man in a bright green and yellow long-sleeved jersey with \"ZINK\" and \"Troy Lee Designs\" printed on it is slightly turned towards the camera before turning his back to it, with goggles resting on the back of his neck. A pregnant woman in a blue zip-up hoodie, grey pants, and a light-colored beanie stands near him, along with another man wearing a black t-shirt, a black cap, and a backpack. A brown dog on a leash is also present. Further back, two other women are visible on the path, and in the distance, more people can be seen on the higher elevations of the rocky formations. The overall impression is of an outdoor, natural setting, likely a mountainous terrain, with a focus on the interaction between the individuals and the expansive, earthy-toned environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
