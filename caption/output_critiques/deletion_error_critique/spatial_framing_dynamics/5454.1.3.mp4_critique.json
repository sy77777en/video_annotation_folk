    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, a full shot shows a group of men in the middle ground, positioned on an elevated walkway that extends across the upper half of the frame. A central figure sits on the railing in the center, with the rest of the group standing behind it to the left and right. In the foreground, a concrete structure occupies the bottom of the frame, with a sign positioned at the bottom center. The railing is also in the foreground, situated just above the sign and in front of the men. Bare tree branches are visible in the top left foreground, set against the overcast sky that serves as the background in the upper portion of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of approximately ten young men, mostly with dark complexions, are gathered behind a black metal railing on an elevated walkway, viewed from a low angle. A man stands centrally on the railing, looking down; he is dressed in a black and white patterned jacket and matching pants. To his left, a man in a black hooded jacket makes hand gestures. To his right, another man is partially seen wearing a brown hooded garment. Other men in the group, mostly clad in dark hooded jackets and sweatshirts, stand behind the railing, with some making hand gestures. One man on the left wears a bright blue hooded jacket and patterned light blue jeans. Below the railing, a white sign with black capital letters reads \"NO BALL GAMES.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, a group of people are gathered on a concrete walkway outdoors, looking down from behind a light grey metal railing with vertical bars. The setting is under a flat, grey, overcast sky. A small white sign with black lettering that reads \"NO BALL GAMES\" is attached to the front of the concrete structure. To the left, the dark, bare branches of a tree and the side of a building are visible against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
