    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of an outdoor patio, with no main subjects. The shot begins tilted up, showing lush green foliage in the background at the top of the frame and a low white wall in the middle ground. The camera then tilts down to reveal the full patio. In the final composition, a round, glass-topped table is in the bottom center foreground, with a chair partially visible at the bottom edge. To the right, two lounge chairs sit in the middle ground, while a sandy area with a large tree occupies the left middle ground. The white wall and foliage now form the background at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an architectural scenery shot of a secluded outdoor patio, likely at a tropical resort. The space features a modern grey-paved area with a round, glass-topped wicker table and cushioned lounge chairs, which gives way to a sandy garden with a large tree and lush green foliage bordered by a low white wall. There is no main subject because the focus is on establishing a sense of place and a tranquil atmosphere. The composition is designed to immerse the viewer in the environment, emphasizing the blend of comfortable design with natural, private surroundings rather than focusing on a specific person or action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A tilt down reveals an outdoor patio in a tropical setting during the daytime. The patio floor is made of smooth, grey material, with matching stepping stones leading onto a patch of light-colored sand. In the sandy area stands a large tree with a dark, textured trunk, surrounded by green plants. The patio is furnished with a round, glass-topped table on a dark woven base, two woven chairs with grey cushions on top, and two long, grey lounge chairs with cushions resting against a white wall. A small, white, square box sits in the center of the table. Beyond the white wall, dense green foliage and trees are visible under natural light.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
