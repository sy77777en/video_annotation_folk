    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a stable wide shot, initially capturing a man in the middle ground, positioned slightly right of center, walking towards the camera along a wooden path that stretches from the bottom center foreground into the center background. A white dog follows him, also starting in the middle ground, centered on the path. Trees frame the scene on the left and right, extending from the middle ground into the background, where sunlight filters through. The man moves towards the foreground and exits the frame at the bottom left. The dog continues towards the camera, briefly filling the foreground before also exiting past the camera on the left, leaving the frame focused on the leaf-covered path receding into the sunlit forest background. The camera remains static and positioned low, close to the path level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man and a dog walking along a leaf-covered path in a forest. The man, wearing a black long-sleeve shirt and dark pants, has a medium build and a beard. He walks toward the camera with a relaxed posture. The dog, a medium-sized breed with a white coat, follows closely behind. Both subjects move steadily along the path, with the man exiting the frame to the left first, followed by the dog. The scene captures a serene moment in the forest, emphasizing the companionship between the man and the dog.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene in a forest during the daytime, with sunlight filtering through the trees, casting dappled light on the ground. The setting features a wooden path covered with fallen autumn leaves, creating a natural, earthy texture. Tall trees with a mix of green and golden leaves surround the path, indicating a transition into fall. The atmosphere is calm and serene, with no visible weather disturbances. The scene transitions smoothly, maintaining focus on the path and the surrounding foliage, emphasizing the tranquil forest environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a stable wide shot in a forest, showing a man and a dog walking toward the camera. The man exits the frame to the left first, followed by the dog. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
