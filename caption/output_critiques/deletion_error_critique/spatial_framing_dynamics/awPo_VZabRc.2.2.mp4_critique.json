    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, an animated man is initially seen in the top left of the frame, in the middle ground, leaping over the left banister of a staircase. He lands on the top landing in the center of the frame before moving to the right side. He then contorts his body to descend by clinging to the exterior of the right banister, moving from the center towards the bottom right. The staircase occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a building facade and glowing windows in the background. A barred window is visible in the bottom center of the frame, below the main landing. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated man with a highly stylized and atypical appearance is depicted. He has an extremely slender and elongated physique, with disproportionately long arms and legs that bend at sharp, unnatural angles. His skin is pale, and his face is characterized by a sharp, pointed chin, pointed ears, and black hair styled into a prominent widow's peak. He is dressed in a long, black, high-collared coat over a white shirt and dark trousers, with his entire form rendered in a sketchy, angular animation style that emphasizes his non-human proportions and contorted poses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a hand-drawn animated scene set at dusk, a character ascends a set of wide, gray concrete stairs with solid banisters, moving towards the entrance of a building. The building features a light-colored facade and arched windows that emit a warm, yellow glow from within. Below the main landing of the staircase, a barred window is visible on a lower level. The scene is rendered in a sketchy style with dark outlines against a pale, warm-toned sky.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
