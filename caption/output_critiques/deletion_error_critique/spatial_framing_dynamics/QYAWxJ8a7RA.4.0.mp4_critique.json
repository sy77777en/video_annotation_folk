    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot, where the camera is positioned above the subjects. A blue man is seated in the middle ground, on the right side of the frame, facing away from the viewer. Across a white desk, positioned in the center middle ground, sits a grey man in the middle ground, left of center, facing the blue man. A white microscope is on the left side of the desk in the middle ground, and a white binder is in the center of the desk, also in the middle ground. The background features a tiled wall spanning the width of the frame, with a clock on the top left and a door on the right. The text \"1960\" is overlaid in the bottom left foreground. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly zooms in and lowers its angle, transitioning to a medium shot at the subjects' eye level, maintaining the relative positions of all elements within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, depicted in a blue, low-polygon style with short dark hair and wearing a suit-like attire, is seated on a white chair with his back to the viewer, facing a white desk. Across this desk sits another man, rendered in a grey, low-polygon style and wearing a simple top, who is facing the seated blue man. On the left side of the white desk rests a white microscope. Positioned on the desk, between the microscope and the seated blue man, is a white binder with a dark spine or label. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"1960\" along with a number.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a stark, white, tiled room, likely a laboratory or medical office, with a plain white floor and a simple white door. A white desk occupies the center, upon which sits a white microscope and a white binder. Two figures are present: one, rendered in dark grey, is seated behind the desk, while the other, in a distinct blue, is seated in a white chair in front of the desk. A circular object, likely a clock, hangs on the tiled wall, and a wall-mounted bookshelf with several books is also visible. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, with the blue figure providing a point of contrast. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"1960\" along with an additional number. The camera combines a rightward truck, forward movement, and downward movement while slightly tilting upward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
