    "pre_caption": "This video starts with a close-up, overhead shot of several items on a corkboard. A blue sticky note labeled \"BUTCHER\" is positioned in the top left, with a silver game piece to its right in the top center. A red string extends from a pushpin on the \"BUTCHER\" note down toward the center of the frame. The camera then tilts down, following the red string. As it moves, the initial items shift toward the top of the frame and out of view, revealing a second blue sticky note labeled \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" that becomes the new central subject, held by a red pushpin. A portion of a yellow note remains visible in the bottom left throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot reveals several items pinned to a brown corkboard. The initial focus is on a light blue, square sticky note with the word \"BUTCHER\" handwritten in black capital letters. Next to it is a tilted, rectangular, silver game piece for \"PARK PLACE,\" which has a code \"676XDHQ1P6\" printed on it. A red string is attached to a red, round-headed pushpin that holds the square sticky note. The view then follows the red string and pushpin down to another light blue sticky note. This second note, now in focus, has the words \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" handwritten on it in black capital letters. A portion of a yellow sticky note with \"$2k for $10k\" written on it is also visible on the left side of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up shot focuses on a corkboard with several items pinned to it. In the center of the frame, a light blue sticky note with the word \"BUTCHER\" in black marker is visible next to a silver, rectangular game piece for \"PARK PLACE.\" Both items disappear from the top of the frame as the camera moves down. The sticky note is pinned by a red thumbtack, which is connected to a red string. The camera moves down to reveal another light blue sticky note with \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" written on it, pinned by another red thumbtack. A corner of a yellow note with \"$10k\" is partially visible to the left of the two sticky notes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.",
