    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a drone with a mounted camera is fixed in the center foreground. The camera is positioned at the drone's level, capturing it from a frontal perspective. The rocky mountain landscape occupies the bottom two-thirds of the frame, stretching from the middle ground directly beneath the drone into the background. In the background, the top third of the frame is filled with a blue sky and scattered clouds, situated above the drone and the mountain peaks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black quadcopter drone is shown in mid-air from a frontal perspective. The drone has a central body with four arms extending outwards, each tipped with a black propeller assembly. A blue and black design is visible on the arms. Mounted on top of the drone's central frame is a black, box-shaped action camera. This camera features a large, circular lens on its front face, and below it, the word \"GoPro\" is written in blue text. The camera is secured by a black mounting bracket.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot captures a black drone gliding smoothly through the air, with a boxy, black GoPro camera mounted on its top frame. The drone moves against the backdrop of a vast, rocky mountain landscape under a bright blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The terrain below is a mix of grey rock, sparse vegetation, and patches of white snow, suggesting a high-altitude, alpine environment during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
