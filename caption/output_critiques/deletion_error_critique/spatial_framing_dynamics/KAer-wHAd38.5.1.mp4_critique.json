    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a rural landscape, capturing the expansive environment from a low angle relative to the road. The scene begins with a view of a wide, dusty road leading towards a bridge, with a speed limit sign positioned in the foreground on the right side. The sign is initially prominent in the lower right quadrant of the frame. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward along the road, gradually approaching the bridge. The bridge, with its concrete structure and metal railings, becomes more central in the frame, spanning across the middle ground. The road curves slightly to the left, guiding the viewer's eye towards the bridge. In the background, a cluster of lush green trees occupies the left side of the frame, while a red gate and two buildings appear further back on the right. The sky, filled with scattered clouds, dominates the upper portion of the frame throughout the video. The camera maintains a consistent height, keeping the road and bridge at eye level, providing a continuous and immersive perspective of the rural setting. The spatial composition shifts subtly as the camera advances, bringing the bridge into greater prominence while the initial foreground elements recede.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a rural road leading to a bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and a vibrant blue sky filled with scattered, fluffy clouds. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the open road, the natural elements, and the serene atmosphere. A distant red gate is visible, with some buildings behind it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor rural setting during the day, featuring a wide, dusty road leading to a bridge. The sky is bright with scattered clouds, casting soft shadows on the ground. On the left side of the frame, there is a cluster of lush green trees and a small hill, with a red gate and two buildings behind it. The bridge, made of concrete with metal railings, spans a small body of water. A traffic sign indicates a speed limit of 30, suggesting a structured environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and open, with natural and man-made elements harmoniously coexisting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
