    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a tiger lying on its side. The tiger's hind legs and paws are positioned in the bottom left foreground, while its striped torso extends across the middle ground from the center to the right side of the frame. Green plants are visible in the immediate foreground at the bottom and in the middle ground to the left. A stone wall occupies the background. The tiger's tail, initially resting near its legs, lifts up toward the top of the frame and then lowers again. The camera is positioned at the tiger's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large tiger with vibrant orange fur and distinct black stripes is lying on its right side on the ground. The inside of its legs and its paws are white with black markings. The tiger is resting amongst green plants, with its long, striped tail also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting with natural light, a tiger rests on its side near a patch of green grass and leafy plants. A rough, light-brown stone wall forms the background. The tiger's orange and black striped back and hind legs are visible as it lies on the ground. Its long, striped tail moves up and down in a slow, deliberate motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
