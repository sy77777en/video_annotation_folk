    "pre_caption": "In a full shot of the subject, a green glass bottle is positioned in the center foreground, tilted slightly. Inside the bottle, a 2D animated mouse is initially located in the bottom center of the frame. The mouse then floats slightly upward and toward the center-left. In the out-of-focus background, a window is visible on the left, and a lit wall sconce is on the right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 2D animated brown mouse with a tan face, large pink ears, and whiskers is depicted inside a realistic, green glass bottle. The bottle is filled with a bubbly, green liquid, and its inner surface is covered in condensation. The mouse is shown submerged within the liquid, first with his cheeks puffed out as if holding his breath, and then with a surprised expression featuring wide eyes and an open mouth. The combination of the flat, cartoon character within the three-dimensional, textured environment of the bottle presents an atypical visual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up shot focuses on a green glass bottle filled with a bubbly, green liquid. Submerged within the liquid is the cartoon character Jerry the mouse, who appears to be floating amidst the effervescence. The background is a softly lit, out-of-focus interior room, where a window with curtains and a glowing wall sconce are visible, suggesting an evening setting.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
