    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a serene street scene in a traditional Japanese neighborhood. The camera is positioned at street level, providing a first-person perspective. In the initial frame, the street runs diagonally from the bottom left to the top right, with traditional wooden buildings lining the right side. These buildings are in the middle ground, with their facades and balconies clearly visible. Lush greenery, including bushes and trees, is positioned in the foreground on both sides of the street, adding vibrant contrast. The clear blue sky and power lines are visible in the background, stretching across the top of the frame. As the video progresses, the camera pans slightly to the right, maintaining the wide shot while revealing more of the street and additional buildings. A person on a scooter and another walking are seen in the middle ground, moving from left to right, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quaint street lined with traditional wooden buildings. The architecture features a mix of dark wood and light-colored facades, with some structures showcasing intricate balconies and sliding doors. The street is bordered by lush greenery, including neatly trimmed bushes and tall trees, adding a vibrant contrast to the earthy tones of the buildings. A clear blue sky overhead enhances the serene atmosphere, while a few people and a food delivery person on an electric scooter add a sense of everyday life without drawing focus away from the overall environment. The emphasis is on the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, creating a peaceful and inviting urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot captures a serene street scene in a traditional Japanese neighborhood during the day. The environment is outdoors, featuring a row of quaint buildings with distinct architectural styles. On the left, a wooden house with a dark facade and a tiled roof stands next to a lighter-colored building with a balcony. The street is lined with neatly trimmed bushes and small trees, adding greenery to the scene. Overhead, power lines stretch across the clear blue sky. A person on a scooter rides along the road, while another individual walks nearby, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. The overall setting is calm and picturesque, with a blend of natural and architectural elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
