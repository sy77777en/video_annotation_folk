    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the scene is framed looking down at a construction site. The lower body of a person occupies the bottom-center foreground, with their right arm extending from the bottom right toward the middle ground. In the top-left foreground, a green basin containing mortar and a trowel sits on a concrete surface. A low, partially constructed brick wall stretches horizontally across the middle ground from the top left to the top right. In front of this wall, thin white guide strings are visible in the middle ground. The top-right background shows a lower level of unpaved ground with dirt, rocks, and some vegetation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person with brown skin is standing on a construction site. That person is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt over a purple and pink patterned garment wrapped around that person's lower body. On that person's right wrist, there is a black bracelet, and on that person's feet are blue flip-flops. Multiple thin white cords are placed on the ground in front of that person's right hand, guiding the placement of reddish-orange bricks that are being laid in rows with wet, grey mortar. Directly in front of that person, a dark green plastic basin contains more grey mortar, with a trowel that has an orange handle sticking out of the mixture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures an outdoor construction scene during the daytime. From a concrete slab, the view looks down upon a low, partially constructed wall made of rectangular orange bricks held by wet, dark gray mortar. A green plastic basin containing more mortar and a trowel with an orange handle rests on the concrete. Below this elevated area, the ground is unpaved, showing dirt, large rocks, and some green vegetation. The person's lower body is dressed in a patterned garment, and they are wearing a light-colored shirt on their upper body.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
