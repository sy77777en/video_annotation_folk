    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot filmed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, the camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The back of a person occupies the left foreground. In the middle ground, a man stands slightly right of center, and a woman stands to his right, closer to the right edge of the frame. A small portion of another person's shoulder is also visible in the right foreground. The framing and positions of all subjects remain unchanged throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit scene, a man with a prominent mustache and beard stands slightly to the right of the center, wearing a dark beanie and a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch over a dark shirt while holding a rifle across his chest. To his left, a woman with shoulder-length, light brown hair is visible, dressed in a light-colored jacket over a dark top. Both are looking toward a third individual in the foreground. As the video progresses, a hand holding a mask enters from the left side of the frame and places it over the head of the person in the foreground. Additionally, a small portion of another person's shoulder is faintly visible on the right side of this individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set within a large, dimly lit indoor space. The environment is dark and cavernous, with a cool, blue-green color cast and soft, hazy light coming from an unseen source above. The background is indistinct, suggesting a hangar or warehouse. Slightly to the right of the center, a man wearing a dark beanie and a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch holds a rifle. To his left stands a woman in a light-colored collared jacket.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
