    "pre_caption": "In a static, wide, top-down shot, a long, black rectangular table is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame in the middle ground. A single red figure stands at the top edge of the table near the frame's center, with numerous orange figures surrounding the table's top, bottom, and right sides, all in the middle ground. On the table, a white grid is located in the center, and a glowing red 'H' in a box is to its left. In the top left quadrant, a few orange figures stand in the middle ground, while a single blue figure walks from right to left through a doorway in the top left background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, top-down view, a group of abstract, monochrome human figures are gathered. A single red figure stands at the head of a long, black rectangular table, leaning over a white grid-like object on its surface. Surrounding the table are numerous orange figures, all oriented towards the red figure. To the left of the table, a few other orange figures stand apart from the main group. In the upper left corner, a single blue figure walks through a doorway. Beneath the table on the left is a translucent box containing a glowing red object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A top-down view reveals a dark, minimalist room with a grainy, textured floor. At the center, a long, black rectangular table is surrounded by numerous stylized, orange-colored figures. A single, bright red figure is positioned at the top-center of the table, in front of a white grid pattern on the table's surface. To the left of the grid is a small, translucent box containing a glowing red object. In the upper left of the room, a blue figure walks through a doorway, while a few other orange figures stand nearby, separate from the group at the table.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
