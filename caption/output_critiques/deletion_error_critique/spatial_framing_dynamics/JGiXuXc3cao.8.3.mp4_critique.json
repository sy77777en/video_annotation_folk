    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a white submersible positioned in the center middle ground against a black background. A thin cable extends from the submersible to the top center of the frame, while two beams of light project from its underside toward the bottom left and bottom right. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then arcs counterclockwise around the submersible. This movement causes the shot to transition into a wide shot, with the submersible moving to the top center of the frame and its two light beams becoming centrally positioned, pointing toward the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, submersible vehicle is depicted against a solid black background. The vehicle has an elongated, rectangular, cage-like frame, through which some internal components are visible. It is suspended from a single, thin white cable extending upwards. From its underside, two distinct, conical beams of light are projected downwards and outwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a vast, black void, a white, cage-like submersible is suspended by a thin cable extending upwards into the darkness. The long, cylindrical vehicle is equipped with two forward-facing lights that cast distinct, conical beams downward, cutting through the otherwise pitch-black environment. The scene is entirely monochromatic, featuring the stark white of the submersible and its cable against the deep black background. The camera arcs counterclockwise, making a quarter turn until the two beams of light emitted from beneath the submersible are positioned slightly above the center of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
