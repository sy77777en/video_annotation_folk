    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a man in the left foreground, positioned in profile and facing toward the right side of the frame. The background consists of brightly lit, out-of-focus architectural shapes. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly arcs counter-clockwise around the man, causing his face to turn slightly toward the camera into a three-quarter view. During this camera movement, a second man becomes briefly visible in the left foreground, positioned directly behind the main subject. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up profile of a Black man facing to the right of the frame. He has short, dark hair, a dark goatee, and a serious expression with his mouth slightly open. He is wearing a dark shirt and has a clear, coiled earpiece in his right ear, with the wire running down his neck. A strap is visible around his neck. The lighting is dramatic, casting most of his face in shadow while highlighting the contours of his profile. Briefly visible behind him and to his left is a second Black man, also wearing dark clothing and what appears to be an earpiece, looking in the same direction.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is depicted with strong backlighting, creating a high-contrast visual. The background is a bright, out-of-focus expanse of white and pale blue, punctuated by large, indistinct architectural forms, suggesting a cityscape or a view from under a large bridge, which is briefly visible through its columns and overhang. The foreground prominently features the main subject, with dynamic lighting that keeps half of his face in shadow and the other half illuminated. A clear, coiled wire of an earpiece is discernible near the person's ear and neck. The camera's position shifts slightly, arcing counterclockwise around the man, allowing different parts of his face to become visible in the lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
