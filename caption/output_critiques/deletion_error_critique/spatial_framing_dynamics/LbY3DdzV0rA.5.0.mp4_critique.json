    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, static shot that focuses on a vast landscape rather than a specific subject. The silhouetted rock formations of the canyon occupy the entire bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The top half of the frame is filled by the sky, with a large, dark storm cloud positioned in the top center. Rain can be seen falling from the base of this cloud into the middle ground, just above the canyon. The horizon line sits near the vertical center of the composition, with the setting sun visible on the left. A white text overlay is located in the bottom right corner of the foreground. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking out over the expansive scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a majestic landscape scenery shot of the Grand Canyon during a dramatic sunset. The sky is a canvas of soft blues and warm, golden light, dominated by a large, dark storm cloud. The setting sun creates a striking contrast against the deep shadows that envelop the canyon's vast, layered rock formations. The composition lacks a singular main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the immense scale, the atmospheric beauty, and the powerful, transient moment of weather interacting with the iconic landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme wide shot captures the Grand Canyon at sunset. The landscape is composed of layered rock formations that are mostly in deep shadow, creating dark silhouettes against the sky. The sky above is filled with dramatic clouds, with a large, dark formation at the center. The setting sun on the horizon illuminates the clouds from below with a warm, orange glow, while the upper sky is a pale blue. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"PHOTOGRAPHED AND EDITED BY MIKE OLBINSKI\" in white.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
