    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle point-of-view shot, the curved, striped surface of a rocket booster occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. Initially, a second rocket stage is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, attached to the booster with its engine firing a bright plume of light. The Earth is visible in the background, filling the lower portion of the frame below the rocket, while the blackness of space occupies the upper background. The second stage then separates and moves directly away from the camera, receding from the middle ground into the background. As it travels away, it becomes smaller within the frame, and its engine burn ceases, revealing the circular nozzle. The booster remains stationary in the foreground throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a black and white booster stage with vertical stripes and a curved top, positioned in the foreground. A silver rocket with a round shape and a circular opening at its top separates from the booster, moving away into space. As the rocket detaches, bright flames and bursts of light are visible at its base. The rocket becomes more distant as it travels further from the booster, and both objects are seen against the backdrop of Earth, with blue oceans and white clouds visible below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted to a rocket, the view looks up towards the blackness of space, with the curved horizon of the Earth visible below. The planet is covered in a pattern of white clouds over a blue surface, all glowing under a bright atmospheric haze. In the foreground, the curved surface of the rocket stage, featuring a pattern of black and white vertical stripes, is visible. Initially, an upper stage with its engine firing a bright orange-yellow plume is attached. This cylindrical, metallic stage then separates and moves away from the camera, its engine nozzle becoming clearly visible as it recedes against the backdrop of the Earth and space. Small particles are seen floating in the environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a rocket separating from its booster stage in space. The booster stage is black and white with vertical stripes and a curved top, while the rocket is silver and round with a circular opening at the top. As the rocket moves away from the booster, flames burst from its bottom. In the background, Earth is visible with its blue oceans and white clouds.",
