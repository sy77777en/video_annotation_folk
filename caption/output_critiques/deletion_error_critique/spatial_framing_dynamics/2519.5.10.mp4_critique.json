    "pre_caption": "This is a static close-up shot of a pair of hands positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. The right hand, with its palm open, is located centrally, while the left hand is positioned to the left, its fingers casting shadows across the right palm. A small amount of a red substance is visible on the tip of the right thumb, which is in the upper right of the frame. In the out-of-focus background, indistinct papers and a red-colored object in the bottom right are visible. The camera is positioned above the hands, looking down at them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot focuses on a person's hands in a dimly lit environment. The person, who has a light skin tone, holds their right hand up with the palm open. The tip of the right thumb is covered in a small amount of a wet, red substance that appears to be blood. The left hand is positioned near the right, with the fingers of both hands loosely touching and casting shadows across the right palm. The scene is illuminated by a warm, directional light that highlights the hands against an indistinct background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a pair of hands is held in the foreground, illuminated by a warm, directional light that creates soft shadows. The palm of one hand is visible, and the tip of its thumb is coated in a wet, red substance. The fingers of the other hand are partially interlaced with the first. The background is out of focus, showing the faint outlines of papers and a red-colored object on a flat surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
