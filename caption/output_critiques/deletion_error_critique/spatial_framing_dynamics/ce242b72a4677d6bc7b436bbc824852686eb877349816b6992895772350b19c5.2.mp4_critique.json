    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot frames a woman in the right half of the frame, seated in the middle ground of a car's back seat. The car's interior, including a headrest, occupies the right side of the frame, while the car door and window are on the left. Through the window, a building is visible in the background. The woman initially looks down and toward the bottom left of the frame before slowly turning her head to the left to look out the window, shifting her profile to face the left edge of the frame. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, straight, dark hair and what appears to be East Asian features is seated in the back of a car. She is wearing a tan trench coat over a black top and has a small, gold hoop earring in her left ear. The car's interior features light-colored leather seats. She is shown in a three-quarter view, initially looking down before turning her head to gaze out the right-side window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the day from inside a moving vehicle, showing the back passenger area. The car's interior features light beige leather seats with a visible headrest. A woman with long, dark hair, wearing a tan trench coat, is seated and gazes out the side window. Through the tinted window, the exterior of a light-colored building and indistinct greenery can be seen passing by.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
