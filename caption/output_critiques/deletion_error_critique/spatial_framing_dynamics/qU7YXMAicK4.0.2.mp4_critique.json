    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot taken from above, a plant seedling in a pot is centered in the frame and occupies the middle ground. The plant is set inside a light-colored wooden box, the walls of which form the background, while its base is in the foreground. The composition is flanked by static vertical green bars on the left and right sides of the frame. In the time-lapse sequence, the plant's two large leaves subtly shift their position and orientation, while a new, smaller leaf grows upward from the center of the plant.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, green plant seedling sits in a plastic pot that changes color with the lighting conditions, appearing bright purple under focused light and pink under natural light. The pot is filled with dark soil and features a single, upright green stem topped by two large, heart-shaped cotyledon leaves with a distinct mottled pattern of light and dark green. Emerging from the center, between the two larger leaves, is a smaller, new true leaf with a slightly serrated edge. The pot is positioned inside a light-colored wooden box, with lighting alternating between a focused light from above and natural light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a time-lapse sequence, a small plant seedling is shown inside a light-colored wooden box, with lighting alternating between a focused spotlight from above and natural light. This causes the plant's pot to appear purple under the spotlight and pink under natural light. The plant, potted in dark soil, has a green stem and two large, heart-shaped leaves with a mottled light and dark green pattern. As the sequence progresses, the leaves shift their position and a smaller, new leaf grows from the center of the plant. The video features an overlay of vertical bars on the left and right sides of the scene, which gradually darken from olive green to a deep dark green.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
