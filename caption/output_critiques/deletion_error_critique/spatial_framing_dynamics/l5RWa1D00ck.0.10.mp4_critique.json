    "pre_caption": "A man is shown in a close-up, initially positioned in the center-left of the foreground in profile, facing left against a dark, out-of-focus background. He turns his head away from the camera, moving to the center of the frame, now seen from the back, with blurry yellow buses appearing in the background. He then turns his head back toward the left, returning to a profile view in the center foreground. Finally, he turns his head to face the camera directly, remaining in the center of the frame, with a blurry background of trees and a building. The camera remains at the man's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with brownish-blonde hair styled back from his forehead is shown in a series of close-up shots. He has a faint mustache and is wearing a dark, collared coat over a white collared shirt. The video captures him from various angles, including in profile with his eyes closed, from the back, and eventually turning to face forward with a calm expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds at dusk or dawn, characterized by dim, cool-toned lighting with a prominent teal cast. In the out-of-focus background, several stationary, yellowish buses are parked near some trees. The shallow depth of field keeps the foreground clear, where a man in a dark coat stands.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
