    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot. A small, abstract figure, composed of lines and colored dots, begins in the center-left middle ground, situated on the second lowest of five short, black horizontal lines. These lines, serving as platforms, are static and arranged in a staggered, ascending pattern from the bottom left to the top right of the frame, all within the middle ground against a plain light gray background. The abstract figure moves dynamically from left to right, hopping upwards from one platform to the next, progressing towards the top right of the frame. The camera maintains a side-view perspective, positioned at the height of the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small, abstract figure composed solely of thin black lines, resembling a stick figure wearing a round-topped hat and riding a small vehicle adorned with green, blue, and red ribbons. The figure moves dynamically from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. Accompanying the figure are short, thick black lines that symbolize elements like steps, changing dynamically as the figure moves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view 2D gaming video captures a scene in profile within a minimalist, abstract digital space featuring a pure white background. The scene includes several intermittent, short, thick, black horizontal line segments arranged in a staggered, ascending pattern from left to right, serving as platforms. A small, animated figure, composed of various colored parts including small green, blue, and red elements, consistently navigates these platforms, positioned near the center-left of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
