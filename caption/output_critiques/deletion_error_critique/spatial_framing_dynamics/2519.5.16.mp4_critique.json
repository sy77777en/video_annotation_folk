    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the shoulders up. The man is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground. Initially, his gaze is directed downward, and his eyes are closed. As the video progresses, he slightly raises his head and opens his eyes, shifting his gaze forward. The background is blurred and indistinct, situated behind the man in the middle ground, creating a sense of depth. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position of the subject within the frame. The lighting emphasizes the man's facial features, keeping him as the focal point against the subdued backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair. He has a slight beard and mustache, and his expression appears contemplative. He is wearing a collared shirt with a checkered pattern. The man is facing forward, with his gaze initially directed downward and his eyes appearing heavy-lidded. He then slightly raises his head and opens his eyes, suggesting a shift in focus or thought. His facial features are prominent, and the lighting highlights the texture of his skin.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a subdued atmosphere, likely captured in a dimly lit room. The environment features muted colors, with soft shadows and a focus on a man's face. He is positioned centrally, with a neutral expression, and the lighting highlights subtle textures on his face. The background is blurred, emphasizing the man while maintaining a sense of depth. The overall scene conveys a quiet, introspective mood, with minimal movement or change throughout the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
