    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a level, wide shot of a pixel-art world, with a large, floating tower in the center middle ground. Below this main tower, a platform with a glowing portal is also positioned in the center middle ground. A smaller structure is visible in the bottom right, and a geometric pattern fills the top background. The entire scene then begins to rotate horizontally to the left, revealing the 3D nature of the seemingly 2D structures. This rotation shifts the spatial arrangement, bringing different faces of the tower and platforms into view. A brief cut interrupts the rotation, showing a dark silhouette of a tower against a grey background, before returning to the original scene. The rotation continues, causing a small character on the central platform to move across its surface and revealing another structure attached to the main tower's left side, while the camera maintains its level perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a pixelated, stylized world featuring large, floating architectural structures against a dark green, star-dusted background with a geometric pattern. The main structure is a multi-tiered tower made of various shades of green pixels, with arched windows and grassy ledges. Two smaller, similar structures float nearby. On top of one platform, there is a large, glowing green rectangular portal flanked by small, stylized trees. Other elements include smaller floating structures, black bird-like creatures perched on the towers, and small yellow squares that float through the air. A snail with a blue and brown shell is located on top of the platforms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a pixel art world set against a dark, starry void, multi-tiered structures made of green and beige blocks float amidst a gentle rain. The main tower-like formations are adorned with grassy ledges, arched windows, and small, stylized trees. The upper portion of the sky is filled with a large, geometric pattern in shades of teal. The scene dynamically rotates, causing the blocky architecture to shift and present different 2D perspectives of its 3D form. Throughout the environment, small yellow squares glow, and a bright green portal stands on a central platform, while a small, dark, bird-like creature is perched atop the structures.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
