    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot, showing the entire industrial complex from a high, overhead camera angle. The long, rectangular buildings and tall structures with round tops are arranged in a grid pattern, occupying most of the frame, with the row of tall structures running from the lower center toward the upper center, positioned in the middle ground. Roads and rail lines are visible throughout the scene, mainly in the background and middle ground, stretching across the frame. A plane enters at the center and moves upward toward the top center, remaining in the middle ground. Shortly after, an explosion occurs near the bottom center of the frame in the foreground, sending a dense cloud of smoke and debris upward and outward, quickly covering the lower and central portions of the complex. As the smoke expands, it moves from the bottom center to the middle and upper center, shifting from the foreground into the middle ground and background, gradually obscuring the buildings and tall structures from view. The camera remains fixed above the scene throughout, maintaining a high vantage point as the main subjects disappear behind the smoke.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a large industrial complex with multiple long, rectangular buildings and several tall structures lined up in a row, each topped with a bright, round feature. The scene is viewed from above, providing a clear view of the geometric layout and the dense arrangement of the buildings. A plane flies across the frame from the center to the top, followed by an explosion. As the video progresses, a massive cloud of dark smoke and debris rapidly engulfs part of the complex, obscuring several of the buildings and the tall structures from view as they disappear behind the thick smoke.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive industrial area with large rectangular factory buildings, warehouses, and a network of straight roads and rail lines. The setting is outdoors during the day, with the scene rendered in black and white. The rooftops of the buildings are made of corrugated metal and glass, and the area is densely packed with structures arranged in a grid-like pattern. In the center, a row of tall, thin towers or chimneys with bright, round tops lines a main thoroughfare. A plane flies across the frame from the center to the top. During the video, a large explosion occurs near the bottom of the complex, sending thick, dark smoke and debris billowing upward and outward, partially obscuring the surrounding buildings. The video does not contain any overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
