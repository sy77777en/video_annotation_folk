    "pre_caption": "A small, four-lobed black outline appears in the center of the frame against a white background. This central shape rapidly expands and multiplies outwards, with new forms sprouting in all directions to fill the screen. The animation concludes with a static, dense, and intricate pattern of interconnected, hand-drawn organic shapes covering the entire frame. The scene is captured from a fixed, top-down perspective, presenting the growth as a two-dimensional event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A hand-drawn, black-and-white animation depicts the rapid growth of an abstract, plant-like organism. Initially, a small, four-lobed shape with rounded corners appears in the center of a white expanse. This shape quickly expands and multiplies, sprouting into an intricate and dense pattern of organic forms. The final composition features twisting, vine-like lines, stylized leaves, small, round, fruit-like spheres, and scattered star-shaped figures, all rendered in a sketchy, black-ink style.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A small, four-lobed black outline on a white background rapidly expands and multiplies, transforming into a dense, intricate pattern of hand-drawn, organic forms. The resulting black-and-white composition features swirling, vine-like lines, leafy structures, star-shaped figures, and several spherical shapes, all interconnected in an abstract arrangement that fills the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
