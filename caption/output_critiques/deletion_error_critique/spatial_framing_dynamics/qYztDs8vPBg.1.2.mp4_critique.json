    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up, overhead shot of a white surface. In the foreground, a pair of hands is centered, with the left hand holding a translucent block in the center-left and the right hand holding a black diamond tester in the center-right, its tip pressed against the block. A gold watch is partially visible on the left wrist, beneath the block. In the middle ground, a smartphone sits at the top-left, next to a branded eraser at the top-center. A folding knife is positioned on the right side, with a digital caliper in the background at the top-right. Throughout the shot, the left hand slightly rotates the block counter-clockwise while the right hand and the tester remain stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds a translucent, frosted rectangular block and a black handheld diamond tester against a white surface. The person presses the metal tip of the tester, which is labeled \"SELECTOR II,\" against the block. The tester is on, with its LED scale fully illuminated into the red \"DIA\" section, and two red indicator lights are lit. A gold-colored link-band watch is being held by the person's left hand. In the background, a smartphone with its camera app open sits on the left, next to a white eraser and a set of colored pencils. To the right, a silver digital caliper and a folding knife with a blue textured handle are also visible. A metal piece labeled \"JerryRigEverything\" is present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot captures a top-down view of a collection of items on a white surface. A pair of hands holds a large, translucent, faceted block and a black electronic device labeled \"SELECTOR II\". The device, featuring an illuminated scale of lights and a metal probe, is pressed against the block, causing it to beep and its lights to reach the red section. In the background, a smartphone with its camera app open, a digital caliper, a set of colored pencils, a folding knife, and a small screwdriver are arranged on the surface. To the right of the phone, a metal piece displays a \"JerryRigEverything\" label with black text on a white background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
