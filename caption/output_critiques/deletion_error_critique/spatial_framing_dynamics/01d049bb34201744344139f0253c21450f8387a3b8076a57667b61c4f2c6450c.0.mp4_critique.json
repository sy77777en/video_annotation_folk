    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, capturing a valley surrounded by lush, green hills. In the initial frame, the camera is positioned high above, looking down at the scene. The left side of the frame features clusters of buildings with light-colored roofs in the foreground, while dense trees cover the hills on the right, extending into the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward and slightly to the right, maintaining its high angle. This movement reveals more of the valley, with additional buildings and fields becoming visible in the middle ground. The distant mountains remain in the background throughout, providing a consistent backdrop. The camera's height remains above the landscape, emphasizing the expansive view and the serene atmosphere of the rural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a picturesque rural area nestled in a valley. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the lush greenery of the fields and the dense clusters of trees that blanket the rolling hills. The village is dotted with quaint buildings, some with white rooftops, and traditional towers that add a historical charm to the scene. The distant mountains create a majestic backdrop, their hazy silhouettes adding depth and scale to the composition. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the serene atmosphere and the harmonious blend of natural and man-made elements, inviting viewers to appreciate the tranquil beauty of the landscape as a whole.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive outdoor landscape during daylight. It showcases a rural area nestled in a valley surrounded by lush, green hills and mountains. The terrain is dotted with clusters of trees and fields, displaying a patchwork of green and yellow hues. Scattered throughout the scene are small buildings with light-colored roofs, some of which are traditional structures with tower-like features. The village is situated along a winding road that meanders through the valley, leading towards distant mountains shrouded in a light haze. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the natural beauty of the landscape highlighted by the clear sky and gentle sunlight.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
