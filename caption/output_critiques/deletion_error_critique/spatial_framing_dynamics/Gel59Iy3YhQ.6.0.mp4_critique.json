    "pre_caption": "In the wide shot, two animated characters are positioned in the center of the frame, standing in the foreground of a dimly lit room. The character with reddish-brown hair is on the left, while the character with bright green hair is slightly to the right and behind. Both face forward towards the blackboards on the far wall, which are in the background. The reddish-orange lamp above them casts a spotlight, creating a clear focal point on the characters and the blackboards. The room's high, A-frame ceiling and hanging banners are visible in the background, with the cluttered pile of chairs on the left and a single chair on the right in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a consistent view throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two animated characters stand in a dimly lit room, facing a chalkboard. The character on the left has reddish-brown hair and wears a light-colored, long-sleeved jacket. To the right and slightly behind stands a second character with bright green hair, wearing a red long-sleeved shirt and light-colored pants. Both figures are standing still, oriented towards the front of the room.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, cavernous room with a high, A-frame ceiling, a single reddish-orange lamp casts a spotlight on the central area, leaving the periphery in deep shadow. Banners hang from the exposed wooden beams above. On the far wall, beneath high windows showing a dark sky, are two large blackboards. The left blackboard features white chalk drawings, including a circle hanging from the end of a horizontal arm. The room is cluttered, with a large, disorganized pile of chairs on the left and a single chair on the right. Two figures, one with reddish hair and another with green hair, stand within the pool of light, facing the blackboards.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
