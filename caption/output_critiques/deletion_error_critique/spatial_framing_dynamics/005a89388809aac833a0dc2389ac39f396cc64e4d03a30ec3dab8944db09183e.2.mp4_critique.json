    "pre_caption": "This is a medium, over-the-shoulder shot with a shallow depth of field. In the bottom-left foreground, a person's out-of-focus shoulder is visible. The central focus is on a pair of hands in the middle ground, holding a long, white, paper-wrapped object. In the background, a young girl is positioned in the upper-right of the frame, sitting up in a bed with grey pillows and a comforter. To her left, in the background, are several stuffed animals. The camera remains static and at the subjects' level throughout the shot. The girl, initially leaning back against the pillows with her arms crossed, sits up and leans forward slightly, moving closer to the center of the frame to look at the object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the middleground, a person's light-skinned hands are in focus, holding a long, thin object sealed in white paper packaging. The person's shoulder, wearing a light-colored shirt, is visible but out of focus in the foreground. In the background, a young girl with a medium skin tone and dark, curly hair styled in two pigtails is lying in a bed. She is wearing a long-sleeved pink shirt and is propped up against grey pillows, looking at the person holding the package.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene is set within a softly lit bedroom. A young girl in a pink textured shirt is sitting up in a bed with a dark headboard composed of vertical bars. The bed is dressed with gray pillows and a matching gray comforter. Next to the girl, several stuffed animals are visible, including a white swan-like toy with pink wings and another plush toy wearing a red and white striped sweater. In the middle ground, a pair of hands holds a long, thin, white sealed packet.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera uses shallow focus to highlight the middleground, focusing on the person's hands holding a white paper-wrapped stick-like object. In the foreground, the person's shoulder is out of focus, while in the background, a girl in pink lying on the bed is partially visible from the upper body but also out of focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
