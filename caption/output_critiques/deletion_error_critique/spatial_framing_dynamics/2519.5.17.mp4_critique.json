    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of two subjects: an older man and a young boy. The older man is positioned on the left side of the frame, occupying the foreground, while the boy is on the right, also in the foreground. Both are captured from the chest up. The man is facing slightly towards the boy, and the boy is turned towards the man, with his back partly visible to the camera. The camera maintains a steady position at the subjects' eye level throughout the sequence. Initially, the man appears to be speaking or listening intently. As the video progresses, the boy raises his hand towards the man's face, making contact briefly. This action causes a slight shift in the man's posture as he leans slightly towards the boy. The background remains consistent, featuring a neutral-colored wall and a partially visible framed picture. The camera angle does not change, maintaining an over-the-shoulder perspective from behind the boy. The lighting is soft and warm, enhancing the intimate atmosphere of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an older man and a young boy engaged in a close interaction. The man, with gray hair and a weathered face, wears a dark green sweater over a collared shirt. He appears to be speaking or listening intently, with a focused expression. The boy, with short dark hair, is seen from the back and side. The interaction suggests a moment of communication or connection between them, with the man leaning slightly towards the boy, indicating attentiveness or concern.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder point of view, focusing on a dimly lit room. The environment is warm and intimate, with soft lighting casting gentle shadows. The walls are a neutral color, and a framed picture becomes partially visible when the elderly man moves his head. The scene captures two individuals, with the camera positioned behind the younger person, showing their upper body and the interaction with the elderly man. The lighting and close proximity suggest a private and possibly significant moment between the subjects.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
