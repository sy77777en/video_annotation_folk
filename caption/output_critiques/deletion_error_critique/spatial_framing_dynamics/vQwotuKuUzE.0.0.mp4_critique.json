    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a man in the right foreground, shown in profile against a backlit overpass in the background. As he turns toward the camera, a second man enters the frame from the bottom right, and the shot transitions to a medium close-up. In the final framing, the first man is positioned in the center-left foreground, while the second man stands slightly behind him in the center-right middle ground, with the overpass structure remaining in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two Black men are shown wearing black t-shirts under black bulletproof vests with the word \"POLICE\" in large white letters across the chest. Both men have short hair and goatees, and they are wearing black choker-style collars. The first man, seen in profile, has a serious expression as he listens to a device with a clear, coiled earpiece. The second man, who also has short, styled hair, stands behind the first with a concerned expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors in a dimly lit area beneath two large, dark concrete overpasses, characterized by their prominent horizontal beams. A bright, white light source from the background illuminates the edge of the structures and creates a strong backlight, casting the two men in the foreground into near-silhouette. Both men are wearing black vests with the word \"POLICE\" printed in large, white capital letters. One man is initially seen in profile using a communication earpiece while the second man enters the shot and looks at him with a concerned expression.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
