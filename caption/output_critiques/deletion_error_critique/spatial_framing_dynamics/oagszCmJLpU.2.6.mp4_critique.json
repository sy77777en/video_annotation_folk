    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, focusing on a large-scale weather event. A massive supercell storm cloud dominates the top and center of the frame, occupying the middle ground and background. A dense curtain of precipitation extends downwards from the center of the cloud base in the middle ground, reaching the horizon. The foreground and middle ground are composed of a flat plain that fills the bottom third of the frame. In the background, a brighter sky is visible on the far left and far right, just above the horizon. The time-lapse shows the storm cloud formation rotating and slowly moving from left to right across the scene, with the curtain of precipitation sweeping across the landscape in unison. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the storm.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic weather event over a flat, open plain. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object, emphasizing the immense scale of the natural phenomenon. A massive, grey, and turbulent supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, appearing to rotate slowly as it looms over the landscape. A dense, grey curtain of heavy precipitation falls from the base of the storm. The ground is a vast, brownish-yellow field that stretches out flatly, while a brighter, yellowish light is visible above the horizon on both sides, contrasting sharply with the ominous darkness of the storm.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse shows a massive, rotating supercell thunderstorm developing over a flat, open prairie. Turbulent grey clouds dominate the sky, swirling in a large, ominous formation. Below the main cloud base, a dense curtain of heavy precipitation descends to the ground, sweeping across the distant landscape. The ground consists of a wide expanse of brownish-yellow fields, with the flat horizon visible across the bottom of the frame. A brighter, white-yellowish sky is visible on both sides above the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

A dense curtain of precipitation extends downward from the cloud base in the middle ground, spanning from the center-right to the center of the frame. The foreground and middle ground feature a flat plain that occupies the bottom portion of the frame. In the background, a brighter sky is visible on both the left and right sides, just above the horizon. The time-lapse skillfully illustrates the storm cloud formation rotating and gradually moving from right to left across the scene. Additionally, the dense curtain of precipitation is prominently seen extending downward from the cloud base in the background(not middleground). Please maintain the other descriptions as they are.",
