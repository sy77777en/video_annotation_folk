    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a desert landscape, capturing an expansive view of the terrain. Initially, the frame is dominated by a dense cloud of sand and dust particles filling the foreground and middle ground, obscuring much of the scenery. These particles are scattered across the entire frame, with some appearing closer to the camera in the foreground and others further away in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera moves through the cloud of dust, gradually revealing more of the desert environment. The sand dunes become visible in the background, extending from the left side of the frame towards the center and right. The dunes occupy the upper portion of the frame, while the sandy path winds through the lower part, curving slightly towards the left. The camera maintains a low height relative to the sand dunes, offering a close perspective of the ground and the swirling particles. The sky remains visible in the top portion of the frame, providing a clear backdrop to the dynamic motion of the sand and dust. The transition from the initial obscured view to the clearer desert scene occurs smoothly as the camera moves forward, exiting the cloud of particles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures the dynamic desert landscape, with a strong emphasis on the mesmerizing movement of flying dust and sand particles. The camera skillfully highlights the swirling dust, creating a sense of scale and immersion in the environment. As the scene progresses, the camera exits the swirling dust.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, highlights the dynamic motion of sand and debris being kicked up towards the drone, creating a sense of movement and activity within the expansive desert landscape under clear daylight. The scene features vast stretches of sand dunes with a smooth, undulating texture. The sand is a warm, golden hue, and the environment is dry and arid. The sky is a bright blue, providing a stark contrast to the earthy tones of the desert. The overall setting is open and natural, emphasizing the vastness and isolation of the desert terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
