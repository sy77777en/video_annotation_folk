    "pre_caption": "From a point-of-view perspective fixed to a bass guitar's headstock, the shot captures the bassist in the foreground on the right, with the majority of the frame showing a wide view of the stage in the middle ground and background. The guitar's neck and the bassist's fretting hand dominate the foreground, extending from the bottom right toward the center. The bassist's body occupies the right side of the frame. In the background, another performer is positioned centrally on the stage, moving around near stage equipment. Bright, horizontal light bars are located in the middle ground on the left, casting long beams that create depth through the hazy air. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, is not static; it moves in sync with the bass guitar, swaying and tilting as the instrument is played.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a perspective fixed to a light-colored bass guitar, the hands of a light-skinned person are visible playing the instrument. This person, whose curly dark hair is seen on the right, wears a purple velvet long-sleeved shirt. Their left hand is shown fretting the dark wood neck of the bass, which has a purple strap with white lettering attached to its headstock. In the middle ground, another performer with large, curly dark hair and a dark outfit stands on a stage, moving around near what appears to be a microphone stand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted to the headstock of a guitar captures a performance on a dimly lit concert stage. The foreground is dominated by the light-colored guitar, showing its fretboard and a hand in a dark velvet sleeve pressing on the strings. In the middle ground, the stage is illuminated by bright, horizontal light bars and spotlights, casting long, purple-tinged beams through the hazy air. Another performer with curly hair is visible in the distance, standing amidst stage equipment, while the camera's perspective remains fixed to the guitar, moving as the instrument is played. The background consists of the backdrop behind the stage and the live audience in front of the stage.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera in the video appears to be fixed to the top of the bass, capturing most of the bassist’s body on the right side of the frame while leaving much of the shot to show a wide shot of the stage.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
