    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the camera initially looks down at a sandy seabed occupying the bottom-left and center of the frame in the middle ground. A large school of white, dot-like bioluminescent organisms is positioned in the middle ground on the right, bordering a dark abyss that fills the background in the top-right. The camera then moves forward and descends, gliding over the edge of an underwater cliff. As it descends, the seabed on the left recedes, and the dark abyss expands to fill the majority of the frame. A pair of gloved hands enters the frame from the bottom, positioned in the foreground. The camera continues its descent into the dark background, with various clusters of green and white bioluminescent organisms scattered throughout the middle ground. A small, red-glowing creature swims in the middle ground on the left as the view moves deeper into the abyss.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective seen through a red-rimmed visor, the video shows a descent into a dark, underwater abyss. The scene is illuminated by large schools of bioluminescent organisms. One type appears as dense clusters of small, bright white dots, while another group consists of larger, leaf-shaped creatures with glowing green outlines. Below, a sandy seabed is visible, populated by schools of small, dark, fish-like creatures, along with plants and rocks. As the viewpoint moves forward, a pair of red and black gloved hands appears at the bottom of the screen, and a kind of fish-like creature with a small, red, glowing top is swimming around this area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a descent into a dark, alien ocean. The view, framed by the reddish-orange border of a visor, glides over a sandy, greenish-brown seafloor dotted with dark rock formations and patches of underwater flora. Large schools of small, bioluminescent organisms illuminate the dark water, some appearing as bright cyan points of light and others as glowing, leaf-shaped creatures. The perspective moves down a steep underwater cliff into a much deeper and darker abyss, with the character's gloved hands occasionally visible at the bottom of the frame. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Loopy Longplays\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
