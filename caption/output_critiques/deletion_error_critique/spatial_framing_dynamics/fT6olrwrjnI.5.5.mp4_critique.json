    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, an anime character is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, captured in a low-angle sliding pose on a green field that occupies the bottom portion of the frame. A soccer ball is located in the foreground at the top left, positioned next to the character's raised foot. A splash of water is visible in the bottom center of the frame, in the middle ground, originating from the character's slide. The background, filling the top and sides of the frame, is composed of blurred white and grey lines. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking up at the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An anime-style young man with spiky white hair and an intense, shouting expression is captured in the middle of a soccer kick. He wears a white and black sleeveless jersey with the number \"7\" on the front, layered over a black long-sleeved undershirt. His uniform also consists of white shorts with black details, black compression leggings, and purple stripes on his undershirt and leggings. While sliding on a green field, his right leg is extended high, with the classic black and white soccer ball suspended in the air beside his foot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated scene takes place outdoors on a vibrant green soccer pitch under bright lighting. A character is shown in a dynamic sliding motion, kicking up a splash of water from the wet turf. A black-and-white soccer ball is in the air, having just been struck. The background is an abstract blur of white and grey speed lines, indicating fast movement across the field.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
