    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, centered on a large, multi-limbed creature positioned in the middle ground, with two smaller figures perched on top. From the creature's peak, a stream of white particles rises toward a bright orb of light located at the top center of the frame in the background. Layered, mountain-like silhouettes occupy the background, while delicate plant shapes are visible in the foreground at the bottom left. White text appears in the upper-middle portion of the frame, situated between the creature and the light source. The camera, positioned at a low angle looking up, then pulls back, transitioning to a wide shot that makes the central creature and its environment appear smaller within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, dark, reddish-brown silhouette of a fantastical creature is centrally located. The creature's lower half is a thick, twisting, trunk-like form, from which white, root-like appendages sprout. Its upper torso features four long, thin, spider-like arms, two on each side, ending in sharp points. Perched atop this creature's head or shoulders are two smaller creatures, one white and the other brown, each with what appears to be a large, shaking tail. A stream of small, white, bubble-like particles rises from the top of the large creature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, outdoor landscape under a hazy, pink and purple sky, a bright orb of light shines from the top center. The background is composed of layered, rounded silhouettes resembling mountains or large flora. A large, dark silhouette of a multi-limbed figure stands in the center, from which small, white particles float upwards toward the light source. Delicate, plant-like shapes are visible in the foreground. An overlay of white text reading \"October 15, 2024\" is positioned in the upper-middle portion of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.",
