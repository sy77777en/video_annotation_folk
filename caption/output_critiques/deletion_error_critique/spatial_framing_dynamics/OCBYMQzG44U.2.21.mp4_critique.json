    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot is framed from a low angle, with the camera positioned at the surface level of the water. The dark, rippling water occupies the foreground and the bottom half of the frame. In the background, pale green tiled walls fill the top half of the frame. A dark, arched opening is located in the center of the composition, set into the background wall and partially submerged in the water. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a liminal space scenery shot of a room partially submerged in dark, murky water. The walls are lined with a grid of small, pale green tiles, all bathed in a dim, unsettling greenish-yellow light. Emerging from the gently rippling surface of the water is the top of a dark, arched opening in the back wall, its interior shrouded in complete blackness. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a mysterious and eerie atmosphere. The camera angle is level with the water's surface, immersing the viewer in the strange environment rather than focusing on any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is taken from the surface of dark, murky water inside a dimly lit room. The walls are covered in a grid of small, light-green square tiles. Slightly to the left ahead, a large, dark, circular opening or pipe emerges from the back wall, partially submerged in the gently rippling water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
