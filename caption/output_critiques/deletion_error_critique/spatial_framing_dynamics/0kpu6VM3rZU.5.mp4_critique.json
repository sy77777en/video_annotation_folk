    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot centered on a woman in a gold top, who occupies the right foreground. The camera then zooms out to a medium shot, bringing a second woman, an interviewer, into full view in the left foreground as she holds a microphone. In the final framing, the two women are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. A man in a suit stands in the middle ground between them, while other people and red-and-white circular decorations are visible in the background. An \"ET CANADA\" logo overlay is fixed in the bottom left corner. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two women are featured in the foreground at what appears to be a red carpet event. The woman on the right has brown skin, long, straight, slicked-back black hair, and is wearing a metallic gold spaghetti strap top with a V-neckline. She has large gold multi-loop earrings and a tattoo on her left shoulder. She is speaking to the woman on her right. The second woman, the interviewer, has lighter skin and long brown hair styled in a high ponytail. She wears a beige dress with intricate, sheer, lacy detailing around the neckline and shoulders, along with long, dangling silver earrings. She holds a black microphone with a white and gold \"ET CANADA\" logo toward the first woman. In the background, a bald man with a short beard, wearing a dark suit and tie, stands behind the woman in beige. Other people are visible in the background, including a man wearing a black beanie hat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set at a crowded nighttime event on a vibrant red carpet. The setting is within a large, white tent-like structure, with stylized red-and-white circular patterns hanging in the background. Further back, a sparkly wall is visible, and numerous people are seen mingling. In the foreground, an interview is in progress, with one woman holding a black microphone featuring a yellow and white logo cube towards another. An overlay is present in the bottom left corner, featuring a yellow square with the white letters 'ET' and the word 'CANADA' below it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
