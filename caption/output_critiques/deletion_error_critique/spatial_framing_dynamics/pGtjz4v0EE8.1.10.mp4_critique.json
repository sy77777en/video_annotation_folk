    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a cathedral, captured from a low angle with a wide-angle lens. Initially, the cathedral's facade is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground. The foreground consists of stone steps at the bottom of the frame, while buildings on the left and right frame the central structure. The sky occupies the background at the top of the frame. The camera then pulls back and pans slightly to the right, widening the view. This movement reveals more of the plaza in the foreground and a tall bell tower in the middle ground to the right of the cathedral. Throughout the shot, the cathedral remains the central element, though it becomes smaller within the frame as more of the surrounding environment is included. The video is a scenery shot, with blurred people moving quickly across the plaza due to a time-lapse effect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide-angle, time-lapse cityscape scenery shot centered on a magnificent cathedral square. The primary structure is an immense Gothic cathedral with an incredibly ornate facade made of white and dark-striped marble, featuring three large arched portals, numerous sculptures, and spires reaching toward the sky. A large, mirrored window sits prominently above the central entrance, and a tall, striped bell tower becomes visible as the camera arcs counterclockwise. The sky is a brilliant blue, filled with fluffy white clouds that drift rapidly across the frame, while people move as blurs across the expansive stone plaza. There is no single main subject, as the fisheye perspective and time-lapse technique are used to capture the overwhelming scale and dynamic atmosphere of the entire architectural ensemble. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment and the passage of time within it, rather than on any specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide-angle, time-lapse shot captures the ornate facade of the Siena Cathedral in Italy under a bright blue sky with fast-moving white clouds. The Gothic cathedral is constructed from white and dark striped marble and features a highly decorated front with three large arched portals, numerous spires, and intricate sculptures. A large, plain circular glass window sits in the center, below a triangular gable adorned with a golden mosaic. As the camera arcs counterclockwise, a tall, matching striped bell tower is revealed to the side of the main structure. The cathedral is situated in a large, open plaza flanked by multi-story buildings, where a few pedestrians can be seen walking.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
