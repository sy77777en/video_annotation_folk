    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man in paintball gear kneels in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a green grass field. To his left, a large blue inflatable bunker occupies the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground, while a black safety net stretches across the background. The man shuffles slightly to his right, moving toward the center of the frame and closer to the blue bunker while maintaining his low posture. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man dressed in full paintball gear kneels on a grassy field next to a large, inflatable blue and red bunker. He wears a black long-sleeved jersey with white graphics and the word \"MEDIA\" visible in white on the back, paired with black pants that have white lettering down the side. His entire head and face are covered by a black protective mask with a visor. He is holding a paintball marker that is primarily black with a lime green barrel and accents, a black hopper on top, and a green air tank attached to the back. He maintains a low, kneeling stance, aiming the marker forward as he peeks around the side of the bunker.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an outdoor paintball field under a clear blue sky during the day. The ground is covered in vibrant green grass. A large, inflatable bunker composed of blue and red sections stands on the left, while a tall, black safety net encloses the area in the background. In the distance, a smaller, cylindrical bunker also made up of red and blue sections is visible. A person wearing black protective gear, including a mask and a harness, kneels on the grass beside the blue and red bunker, holding a lime green and black paintball marker.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
