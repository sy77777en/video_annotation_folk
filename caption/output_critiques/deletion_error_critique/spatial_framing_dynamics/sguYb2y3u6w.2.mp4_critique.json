    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a white ambulance is positioned in the center of the frame, moving from left to right across the middle ground. A gray road occupies the foreground, while a stylized forest sits in the background. A light green car enters from the right side of the frame, positioning itself to the right of the ambulance in the middle ground. Shortly after, a white car enters from the left, taking a position to the left of the ambulance. The shot concludes with the three vehicles moving in a horizontal line across the center of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' height, tracking their movement from a side-on perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white ambulance with a red stripe, a red cross symbol on its side, and a blue and red siren on its roof is being driven by a green crocodile. The crocodile, visible in the driver's seat, has a long snout and wears a small white hat with a red cross. Also present are two other cars: a small, light green car and a white car, each being driven by a small yellow chick with an orange beak.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime, 2D animated scene, traffic moves from left to right along a gray paved road. The road is bordered by a green lawn and a stylized forest background composed of simple, flat-colored trees in various shades of green and brown against a pale blue sky. The central vehicle is a white van with a red horizontal stripe, a red cross symbol on its side, and a red and blue light on its roof. It is joined by a small, light green car and a white car, all proceeding in the same direction as the background scrolls past.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
