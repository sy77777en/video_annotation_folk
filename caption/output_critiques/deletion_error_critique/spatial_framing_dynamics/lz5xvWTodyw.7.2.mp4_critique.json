    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from a first-person perspective, presenting a wide shot of an indoor hallway that extends from the foreground into the background, occupying the majority of the frame. A paper cutout of a cartoon character on a stick remains consistently positioned in the bottom right foreground. Initially, the hallway stretches forward, with light pink walls on the left and right, cream wainscoting along their base, and a deep red carpet running down the center, all receding into the background. A wall-mounted lamp is visible in the top right foreground, with others appearing in the middle ground on both sides as the perspective moves forward. The camera advances down the hallway, causing elements like framed pictures and additional lamps, initially in the middle ground on the left and right walls, to shift towards the foreground and eventually move out of frame. A white arched wall niche, initially in the background center, becomes more prominent in the middle ground as the camera progresses, flanked by white door frames to its left and right, also moving from the background towards the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is shot from a first-person perspective, showing movement through an indoor hallway. In the bottom right corner, a hand-drawn cartoon character on a white paper cutout, attached to a light brown wooden stick, is consistently visible. This character features a round head with messy, outlined hair, a small bow on the right side of its hair, two dot eyes, a simple curved line for a mouth, and a basic body outline. The hallway is characterized by light pink walls, darker cream wainscoting, a deep red carpet, and is lit by wall-mounted lamps with cream-colored shades; framed landscape pictures are also seen on the walls as the view progresses. At the end of the hallway, a white wall niche is embedded in the pink wall, with white door frames on both the left and right sides, each opening to other pathways.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, progresses down a long, narrow interior hallway. The walls maintain a consistent light pink color, featuring deeper cream wainscoting along the bottom. A continuous red carpet covers the floor. Warm light emanates from ornate wall-mounted lamps. Two doorways line the corridor, and two framed landscape pictures adorn the walls, positioned on the left and right sides. At the visible end of the hallway, there is an arched alcove containing a small shelf. In the lower right corner of the frame, there is a white paper cutout of a cartoon character, drawn with black lines and held on a wooden stick, as part of the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from a first-person perspective, showing a wide shot of an indoor hallway. In the bottom right corner, there is an added sticker with a simple cartoon character drawn on a piece of paper throughout the video.",
