    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a person, capturing them from the chest up. Initially, the subject is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground, with their upper body and face clearly visible. The person stands upright, facing forward, with their head slightly tilted. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout. As the video progresses, there is a noticeable transition where the camera quickly zooms out, shifting from a close-up to a wider shot. This change reveals more of the subject's body, showing them from the waist up, still centered in the frame. The subject's hands are now visible, hanging relaxed by their sides. The background remains consistent, featuring neutral-colored walls and a vent near the top right corner, indicating an indoor setting. The camera maintains its position at the subject's height, ensuring the subject remains the focal point throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with a distinctive appearance. The individual has medium-length, straight red hair and is wearing a white dress shirt paired with a blue and white striped tie. Their face is marked with unusual, exaggerated features, including a prominent, wide smile and large eyes, giving an artificial or mask-like impression. The person is standing upright, and the setting appears to be indoors. In the latter part of the video, the person is shown wearing dark pants, with their hands relaxed by their sides. The overall appearance is striking due to the combination of formal clothing and the unique facial characteristics.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a room with neutral-colored walls and a simple, modern design. The lighting suggests daytime, with soft, natural light illuminating the space. Notable elements include a person wearing a white shirt and a striped tie, with distinct red hair. The room contains minimal furniture, with a visible vent on the wall, contributing to a clean and uncluttered environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
