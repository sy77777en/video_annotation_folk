    "pre_caption": "This high-angle, first-person point-of-view shot is captured from the edge of a cliff, looking straight down. In the foreground, the upper portion of a person wearing a yellow wingsuit is positioned at the bottom of the frame. The rocky, scree-covered ground of the cliff edge is also visible in the immediate foreground. The middle ground and background are dominated by a vast, deep valley below, which fills the majority of the frame from the center to the top. The valley features steep rock faces, green slopes in the top left, and light-colored winding paths across the landscape. The camera is positioned high above the valley and remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person point of view, a person stands on the edge of a rocky cliff. They are wearing a bright, fluorescent yellow wingsuit with blue accents on the shoulders and along the front zipper. The camera is angled downwards, showing the person's upper body and the vast, steep drop into a valley far below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures the view from the edge of a high, rocky mountain precipice. The ground is a mix of gray scree and jagged rocks. Looking straight down, a vast valley is visible far below, featuring green forested slopes and light-colored, winding paths or dry riverbeds. The steep mountain faces are a combination of sheer rock and scree fields, with strong shadows indicating bright daylight. The top of a bright yellow jacket with blue accents is visible at the bottom of the view, belonging to the person standing at the cliff's edge.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
