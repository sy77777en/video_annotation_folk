    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot captures a cityscape scenery. The Altar of the Fatherland monument is centrally positioned, occupying the middle ground and background. In the foreground, a green lawn with flowerbeds spans the bottom of the frame. A road with traffic is located in the middle ground, stretching horizontally between the lawn and the monument. Pedestrians are also visible in the middle ground near the base of the structure. Two large Italian flags on poles are positioned in the middle ground, flanking the monument's central staircase. The sky fills the top of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking slightly up at the large building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot centered on the grand Altar of the Fatherland monument in Rome. The immense, white neoclassical building features a wide central staircase, a large colonnade, and is crowned by two prominent bronze quadrigas on its roofline, all set against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. An equestrian statue stands at the monument's center, and two large Italian flags on tall poles flank the main structure. The composition lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the architectural grandeur and the bustling atmosphere of the surrounding piazza, which includes traffic, pedestrians, and flowerbeds of red and yellow flowers on a large green lawn in the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime view captures the Victor Emmanuel II National Monument in Rome, Italy, set against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. The grand, white marble building is characterized by a wide central staircase, a prominent colonnade, and an equestrian statue at its center. Atop the structure, two bronze quadrigas are positioned on the upper corners. Two large Italian flags are displayed on flagpoles flanking the main staircase. In the foreground, a green lawn features flowerbeds with red and white flowers. A road with flowing traffic, including white taxis, separates the lawn from the monument, where a few people are visible on the steps and the road is bustling with pedestrians.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
