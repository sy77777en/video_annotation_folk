    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a man in the bottom center foreground, crouched on a paddleboard. A massive wave dominates the scene, with its turquoise face occupying the left and center of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. The white, breaking crest of the wave is positioned in the top center and top right, while a clear blue sky is visible in the background in the top right corner. The camera, positioned at the man's level, remains fixed relative to him as he rides along the face of the wave, causing the background and the breaking part of the wave to move from left to right across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, fair-skinned man with blond hair is shown stand-up paddle surfing on a large, breaking wave. He is in a low, athletic crouch, holding a black paddle with both hands. He wears a short-sleeved black rash guard, purple and blue patterned board shorts, a black watch on his left wrist, and a black ankle leash on his right ankle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted to a paddleboard, captures a man riding a massive, curling ocean wave. The scene is set outdoors on a bright, sunny day under a clear, deep blue sky. A large, powerful wave with a turquoise face and a crest of white foam dominates the view, breaking to the right of the rider. The man, wearing a black top and patterned shorts, crouches on the board, holding a black paddle as he navigates the face of the wave.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
