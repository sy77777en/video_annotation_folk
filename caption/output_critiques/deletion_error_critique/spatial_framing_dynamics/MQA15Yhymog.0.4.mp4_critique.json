    "pre_caption": "A full shot shows a woman in the center foreground, initially leaning forward while standing on a yellow surfboard that occupies the bottom center of the frame. A city skyline is visible in the background, stretching across the frame from left to right. The woman then moves vertically downward to a seated position, remaining in the center of the frame. The camera is fixed to the front of the surfboard, providing a low-angle, level perspective that moves with the board through the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned woman with long, wet, blonde hair is shown on a yellow surfboard in the water. She is wearing a yellow bikini and is smiling. The video captures her from a level angle with a locked-on perspective, as the camera remains fixed on the surfboard. Initially, she leans forward while standing with her arms hanging down, and then she sits down on the board.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a yellow surfboard shows it moving through turquoise ocean water. In the background, a city skyline with numerous tall, modern hotel buildings lines a sandy beach under a bright blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The camera, fixed to the board, captures the movement through the water, with white splashes and spray frequently obscuring the view as a person on the board leans forward while standing and then transitions to a seated position.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
