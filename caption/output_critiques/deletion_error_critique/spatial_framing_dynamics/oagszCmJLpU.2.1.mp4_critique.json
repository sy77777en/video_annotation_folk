    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a desert landscape, with the scenery itself serving as the subject. The foreground and lower third of the frame are composed of sandy terrain and sparse vegetation, stretching from the bottom left to the bottom right. A light-colored dirt road enters from the bottom left and curves towards the center middle ground, which is filled with rolling sand dunes and more scrubland. The background is dominated by the sky, which occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame above a low horizon line. The primary dynamic element is a massive cloud formation in the top and center of the frame, which transitions in color from orange to pink and then purple in a time-lapse sequence. The camera remains static and is positioned at a low height relative to the ground, looking straight out towards the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the vast scale of a desert environment and the atmospheric spectacle above it, rather than a singular main subject. The focus is on capturing the immense and dynamic beauty of the natural world itself. The scene is set across a wide expanse of rolling sand dunes dotted with sparse, low-lying green scrub. Dominating the view is a breathtaking timelapse of the sky, where a massive formation of textured mammatus clouds undergoes a spectacular color transformation. Initially illuminated in fiery oranges and yellows by the setting sun, the clouds shift into brilliant shades of pink and magenta, eventually deepening into rich purples as twilight descends and the upper sky turns a clear, dark blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This time-lapse video captures a vast desert landscape under a dramatic, changing sky. The scene features rolling sand dunes and sparse, low-lying green and brown vegetation. A light-colored dirt road winds through the sandy terrain. Above, the sky is filled with a massive formation of clouds. Initially, these clouds are illuminated in shades of orange and gold, with a lumpy, textured appearance on one side and wispy streaks on the other, set against a patch of clear blue sky. As the sequence progresses, the light fades, and the clouds transform into vibrant shades of pink and purple, creating a colorful sunset display over the expansive desert.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
