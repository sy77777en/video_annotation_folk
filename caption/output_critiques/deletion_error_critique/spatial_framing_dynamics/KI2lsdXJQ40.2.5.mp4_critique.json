    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, showing a man in a black suit and a woman in a blue dress positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and right sides of the frame, respectively, both at the center height of the camera. The man stands slightly left of center, while the woman is to his right, both in the foreground. Behind them, in the middle ground and center of the frame, three characters are grouped: a woman with gray hair and a black hat stands to the left, a man with short dark hair is in the center, and a tall, bald man in a grey suit stands with his back to the camera on the right. A girl with short brown hair is also visible in the middle ground, positioned near the center. The background features a bench along the left wall and a large window or glass door on the right, both occupying the background space. As the focus shifts, the camera transitions to center on the three middle-ground characters, now in sharper focus, while the initial foreground subjects become blurred and move out of the primary frame. Throughout, the camera remains at the subjects’ eye level, maintaining a consistent height relative to the characters.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows several claymation humanoid characters dressed in formal black attire, suggesting a social or formal gathering. In the foreground, a man with light skin, short brown hair, and a clean-shaven face wears a black suit and white shirt, holding a small plate of food and facing slightly to the left. To his right stands a woman with light skin, short dark hair, glasses, and a blue dress with a dark top, holding a cake and facing him as if in conversation. In the background center, three more characters are most prominent: a woman with gray hair and a black hat stands next to a man with short dark hair, both wearing black outfits and facing a tall, bald man in a grey suit who stands with his back to the camera. Additionally, there is a girl with short brown hair wearing a dark dress in the middle ground. All characters have stylized, elongated heads and neutral or subdued facial expressions, and their poses suggest they are engaged in quiet social interaction.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a spacious room with light blue walls and a large window or glass door letting in natural daylight. The floor is covered with brown tiles that have a subtle, textured pattern. Several figures, crafted in a stylized manner with elongated heads and simplified facial features, are dressed in dark formal attire and are positioned throughout the room, some standing in small groups. The lighting is soft and even, creating a calm atmosphere. The background includes a bench along one wall and a door with glass panes. No overlays or additional visual elements are present in the video.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a claymation set indoors, where humanoid characters socialize. It begins with a medium shot focusing on a character in the foreground. The focus then shifts to three characters in the middle ground behind them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
