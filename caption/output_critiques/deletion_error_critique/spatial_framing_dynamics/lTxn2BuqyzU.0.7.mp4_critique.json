    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, an animated boy is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on the floor. In the foreground, a coiled green object rests on the bottom right, while another green object is on the bottom left. The background contains a bathtub and shower curtain on the left, and a shelving unit and toilet on the right. The boy shifts slightly in place, but the overall composition remains static. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated young boy with brown hair, wearing a light green t-shirt and grey socks, has a distressed facial expression. A thick, vibrant green, slimy substance is coming out of his nostrils. On the floor around him are several similarly colored green objects; one is coiled like a spring, and another looks like a splattered leaf, appearing to be made of the same substance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit bathroom with light-colored tiled flooring. In the background, a white bathtub and shower curtain are visible on the left, while a simple shelving unit and a white toilet stand on the right. The floor is scattered with bright green, vine-like objects, one of which is curled into a spiral. A young boy in a light green shirt and gray socks is sitting on the floor in the center of the room. The overall lighting is soft and diffuse, illuminating the clean, modern space.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
