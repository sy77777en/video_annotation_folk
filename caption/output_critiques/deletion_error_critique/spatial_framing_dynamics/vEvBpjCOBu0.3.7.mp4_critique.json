    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of the national emblem of the German Democratic Republic, centrally positioned in the frame and occupying the middle ground against a dark, textured background. The emblem is illuminated by a spotlight, creating a clear focus. As the camera pulls back and tilts downward, the emblem recedes into the background and becomes blurred. Simultaneously, an empty pint-style drinking glass rises into the foreground, coming into sharp focus. The glass is centrally positioned on a flat, black surface, which is in the foreground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the transitions, maintaining a consistent perspective as the focus shifts from the emblem to the glass.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of the national emblem of the German Democratic Republic, rendered in grayscale with a metallic texture. The emblem, featuring a hammer and a compass surrounded by a wreath of rye and a tricolor ribbon, is centrally located and illuminated by a spotlight against a dark, textured background. The view then pulls back and tilts downward, causing the emblem to recede and blur into the background as a clear, empty pint-style drinking glass rises into the foreground, coming into sharp focus. The transparent glass sits on a flat, black, three-dimensional surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic setting illuminated by a single overhead spotlight, a three-dimensional rendering of the East German national emblem is mounted on a textured wall. The emblem, featuring a hammer and compass encircled by a wreath of rye, is initially in sharp focus. The perspective then shifts, pulling back and tilting down, causing the emblem to blur into the background as an empty, clear drinking glass on a black pedestal becomes the central focus in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
