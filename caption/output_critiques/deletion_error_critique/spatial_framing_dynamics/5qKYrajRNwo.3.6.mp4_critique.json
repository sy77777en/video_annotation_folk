    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a patterned curtain occupying the center and right of the frame in the foreground. A portion of a puppet's face is initially visible peeking from the left side of this curtain, positioned left of center in the middle ground. To the far left in the middle ground, a container with toothbrushes is present. As the curtain is pulled further to the right, more of the puppet is revealed, transitioning the shot to a medium shot. In this final state, the puppet's upper body and head are visible left of center in the middle ground, while the curtain is now predominantly on the right side of the frame in the foreground. The dimly lit area behind the puppet remains in the background. The camera is at the puppet's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a puppet character. Initially, the puppet is mostly obscured by a patterned curtain, with only a small portion of its face visible, featuring dark curly hair. As the curtain is pulled further to the right, the full face and upper body of an adult male puppet are revealed, including his wide eyes. This puppet has dark, neatly combed hair, a prominent black mustache, and is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved, collared shirt with thin vertical stripes and two buttons at the neck. He is looking slightly downwards and to his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit space, where a patterned curtain, predominantly in shades of blue and yellow with geometric designs, hangs centrally, partially obscuring the view. To the left of the curtain, a dark, metallic-looking container holds red and white toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste. The area behind the curtain is also dimly lit, with indistinct shapes and colors suggesting a room beyond. The overall lighting is low, with a subtle warm glow on the right side of the curtain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
