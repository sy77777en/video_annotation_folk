    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle wide shot, a group of men is positioned horizontally across the middle of the frame, standing in the middle ground on an elevated walkway. A black metal railing runs in front of them, also in the middle ground. In the foreground, a white sign is fixed to a concrete wall at the bottom center of the frame. Bare tree branches are visible in the top left, situated in the foreground, while an overcast sky fills the upper half of the frame as the background. The camera is positioned below the subjects, looking up.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of about ten young men are leaning or resting along a black metal railing on an elevated walkway, looking down. The man in the center, leaning on the railing, wears a black and white patterned puffer jacket over dark pants. To his right, a man in a bright blue puffer jacket and light-wash jeans makes a hand gesture. The rest of the men are dressed in dark winter attire, primarily black and grey hooded jackets and sweatshirts, with some hoods pulled up. One man on the far right wears sunglasses. Below them, a white sign on the concrete wall reads \"NO BALL GAMES\" in black capital letters.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, the scene looks up at an outdoor concrete walkway of a building, where a group of people in winter clothing are gathered behind black metal railings. The railings, composed of vertical bars, run along the edge of the grey concrete structure. Affixed to the concrete wall below the railing is a white rectangular sign with black text that reads \"NO BALL GAMES\". The background is dominated by an overcast, pale grey-blue sky, with the bare branches of a tree visible in the upper left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
