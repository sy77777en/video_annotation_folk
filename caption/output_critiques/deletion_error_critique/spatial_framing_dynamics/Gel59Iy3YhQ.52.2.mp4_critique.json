    "pre_caption": "This is a static, wide shot of a night-time forest scene, with the focus on the environment rather than a specific subject. The scene is framed from a first-person, eye-level perspective. In the foreground, a video game heads-up display is overlaid, with a circular gauge in the top left, a crosshair in the bottom left, and text prompts in the top right. The dark ground occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. Tall, silhouetted trees are visible in the middle ground and background, framing the scene on the left and right. Dozens of small, glowing orbs are scattered throughout the middle ground and background, filling the dark space between the trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a night-time forest scenery shot, where the focus is on the ethereal atmosphere created by numerous small, glowing orbs rather than a specific subject. These orbs, predominantly bright white with a few interspersed blue ones, are scattered throughout the dark environment, illuminating the silhouettes of tall, indistinct trees and the dimly lit ground. The scene is characterized by a strong contrast between these point-like lights and the surrounding darkness, with the overall effect being one of a mysterious and enchanting nocturnal woodland. The absence of a central subject directs attention to the overall mood and the distribution of these luminous particles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is set within a dark forest at night. Tall, silhouetted trees are visible against the blackness. The scene is illuminated by dozens of small, bright, glowing orbs that float and drift through the air, most of which are white, with a few appearing blue. The ground is dark and indistinct. Overlays on the screen display a heads-up display (HUD). In the top left corner, a circular gauge indicates O2 and Fuel levels. In the bottom left, a crosshair reticle is displayed above the text \"GRAVITY 0.4x.\" In the top right corner, text prompts for game controls are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
