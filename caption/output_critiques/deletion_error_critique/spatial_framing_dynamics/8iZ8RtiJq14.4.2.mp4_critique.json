    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a seated humanoid figure is positioned in the center-right middle ground at a desk, with a second standing figure located behind it in the left-center middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly pans to the left. This movement reveals three additional standing figures entering the frame from the left, forming a line in the middle ground behind the seated figure. By the end of the pan, the seated figure and desk occupy the right side of the frame, while the line of standing figures fills the center and left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid figure with a silver, featureless head and silver forearms sits hunched in a black office chair, typing on a vintage beige keyboard at a desk. This figure wears a tan, short-sleeved collared shirt and dark pants with a brown belt. Standing directly behind it is a second humanoid figure, similarly styled with a silver head and arms, wearing a tan, short-sleeved shirt with chest pockets, a brown belt, and dark pants, looking down at the seated figure. A third humanoid figure, wearing a light grey, long-sleeved collared shirt and grey pants, enters from the left and stands beside the second figure, also looking down toward the desk. To the left of this third figure, there are two additional figures wearing tan collared shirts. All five figures have the same metallic, featureless heads.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an office-like setting against a solid black background, a figure with a metallic silver head and hands sits in a black chair at a brown desk, posed as if typing on a vintage beige computer. The figure is dressed in a tan short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. Standing behind the chair, another similar figure in the same attire observes. As the scene moves to the left, more standing figures are revealed, one of whom is wearing a light grey shirt. All figures have featureless, metallic silver heads and hands. A white text overlay at the bottom-left of the screen provides a caption \"[4]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
