    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a vehicle-mounted point-of-view, the silver, mud-caked roll cage of the camera vehicle occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A tan race truck is positioned in the middle ground, initially centered as it drives along a dirt track. The camera follows the truck as it moves toward a large purple archway in the middle ground. As the truck passes under the archway, it launches into the air, rising vertically in the center of the frame before landing and continuing to move toward the camera. Several purple flags are visible in the middle ground on the right side of the track, while green hills and trees form the background. The camera remains at the truck's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video, filmed with a locked-on point of view in front of a race vehicle, shows a tan off-road race truck driving on a dirt track. The truck, heavily caked in brown mud, has a boxy body with red and black accents and the word \"TOYOTA\" written in white on its front panel. In the foreground, the silver, tubular metal roll cage of the camera vehicle is visible. The truck drives toward and jumps under a large purple archway with \"COOPER TIRES\" written across it in white lettering. Several tall, purple, teardrop-shaped flags on poles are positioned along the side of the track before the large purple archway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted to a vehicle, the scene captures a race on a wide, brown dirt track under a clear blue sky during the daytime. The track is flanked by green, grassy hills and scattered trees, with tents and other structures visible in the distance. A mud-splattered race car is seen from the front as it speeds along the track before launching into the air as it passes under a large purple archway with \"COOPER TIRES\" written in white text. Several purple, teardrop-shaped flags with \"COOPER\" branding are positioned along the side of the course before the archway. A portion of the silver, mud-caked roll cage of the camera's vehicle is visible at the bottom of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
