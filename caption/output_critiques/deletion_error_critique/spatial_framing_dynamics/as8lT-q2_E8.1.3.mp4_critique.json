    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot, captured from a low angle looking up at a massive, pyramid-shaped building that occupies the center of the frame from the bottom edge upwards. The building is positioned in the middle ground, its surface covered in a grid of glowing windows. In the top center, a small flying vehicle, silhouetted against a bright orange lens flare, descends toward the pyramid's apex. Two spotlights beam upwards from the structure into the dark sky, where two small points of light are visible in the top left and top right. The background is filled with the scattered lights of a sprawling cityscape on the lower left and right. As the clip progresses, a new spotlight beam enters from the bottom right and sweeps upwards and to the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a striking cityscape scenery shot, characterized by a vast, illuminated urban environment at night. A large aircraft with bright yellow taillights flies in from the top of the frame, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The focus is on the intricate patterns of lights emanating from the buildings, creating a mesmerizing tapestry that highlights the scale and complexity of the city. There is no main subject, as the emphasis lies on the overall atmosphere and the interplay of light and shadow, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the grandeur of the urban landscape rather than fixating on a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a nighttime view of a massive, pyramid-shaped building in a futuristic cityscape. The dark, stepped structure is covered in a dense grid of glowing, greenish-cyan windows, creating a complex, illuminated pattern against the dark sky. Powerful spotlights beam upwards from the building. A small, dark flying vehicle descends toward the apex of the pyramid, silhouetted against a bright, orange lens flare, while the sprawling city extends into the distance as a sea of scattered lights.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
