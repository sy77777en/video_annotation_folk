    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot focuses on a man and a woman dancing in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. Initially, the man is on the left with his back mostly to the camera, while the woman is on the right. In the background, star-shaped decorations hang from the top of the frame, and out-of-focus red and green lights are visible. The couple slowly turns, causing their positions to shift; they move to face each other in profile at the center before the man's back is again toward the camera. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, following their rotation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin and voluminous, curly, shoulder-length blonde hair is dancing with a woman who has light skin and long, straight blonde hair. The man wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bow tie and has a white flower pinned to his lapel. The woman is dressed in a light-colored, off-shoulder garment and wears a corsage of pinkish flowers on her wrist. They are holding hands and have their arms around each other as they dance closely, looking into each other's eyes and leaning in to kiss.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is set in a dimly lit environment, likely a dance or party. The dark space is decorated with glittery, star-shaped ornaments hanging from above. The atmosphere is defined by soft, out-of-focus red and green lights that create a hazy glow and circular lens flares. A couple is seen slow dancing in the middle of the room, their movements gentle as they turn beneath the festive lights and decorations.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
