    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a street-side sign on the right, displaying information about fortune telling, with part of a red bicycle visible on the left. The bicycle is positioned in the foreground, while the sign is in the middle ground. The camera then pans left, revealing the entrance of a ramen restaurant in the middle ground, with a person walking out from the right side of the frame. As the camera continues to pan left, more people are shown walking on the street, with no clear focus on any individual, capturing the overall scene. The people are positioned in the middle ground, with some moving from the right to the left of the frame. The storefront with hanging lanterns is in the background, adding depth to the scene. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bustling street scene with various subjects. A red bicycle with a basket is parked next to a vending machine displaying colorful charts. Several people are walking nearby, including a woman in a tan jacket and black shorts, and another person in a white outfit. A group of individuals, some wearing casual dark clothing, are gathered near a traditional storefront with hanging lanterns and signs. The scene captures a lively urban environment with a mix of modern and traditional elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor street scene in a Japanese setting, likely during the day. The environment features a small, traditional storefront with wooden elements and paper lanterns, creating an authentic cultural atmosphere. A red vending machine and a bicycle with a basket are notable elements, adding to the urban street vibe. The pavement is stone, and the area is bustling with pedestrians, some of whom are wearing casual attire. The scene is lively, with people walking past the shop, which displays various items and signage in Japanese. The overall atmosphere is vibrant and dynamic, reflecting a typical day in a busy neighborhood.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a street-side sign displaying information about fortune telling, with part of a bicycle visible on the left. The camera then pans left, revealing the entrance of a ramen restaurant and a person walking out. The pan continues, showing more people on the street, but with no clear focus, primarily capturing the overall scene. The entire shot is a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
