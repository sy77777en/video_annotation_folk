    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a large cylindrical structure, which occupies most of the frame. This structure is centrally positioned in the 2D space and is in the foreground of the scene. Surrounding the cylinder, multiple rectangular windows are visible on either side, forming part of a light-colored building. These windows are symmetrically arranged and occupy the left and right sides of the frame, extending into the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, revealing more of the surrounding environment while maintaining the cylindrical structure as the central focus. The cylinder remains in the center of the frame throughout, with the windows continuing to line the left and right edges. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing the scene horizontally. There are no significant changes in the spatial position of the elements; however, the transition from close-up to medium shot provides a broader view of the urban setting, emphasizing the relationship between the cylindrical structure and the adjacent buildings. The large green tarp covering parts of the cylinder is consistently visible in the upper portion of the frame, indicating ongoing construction or renovation. The overall spatial framing maintains a balanced composition, with the cylinder as the primary focal point and the surrounding windows adding depth to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large cylindrical structure with a smooth, reflective glass surface, resembling a modern facade. This structure is central and prominent, surrounded by multiple rectangular windows set in a white or light-colored building, suggesting a modern architectural design. The structure appears to be part of a larger building complex, with the windows arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The overall scene conveys a sense of urban architecture with a focus on the distinctive cylindrical element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor urban setting featuring a tall cylindrical building with a green glass facade, surrounded by modern buildings with white exteriors and numerous windows, creating a cityscape. The overcast lighting is diffused and soft, with no direct sunlight visible. A large green tarp partially covers the cylindrical building, indicating construction or renovation work. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective. In the bottom left corner, text reads: \"[7,21] ; DER SPIEGEL - Giant Aquarium Burst - This is How the AquaDom Was Built | SPIEGEL TV (2022),\" providing context about the building's significance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
