    "pre_caption": "This is a static, low-angle, first-person point-of-view shot. In the foreground, a pair of feet are positioned in the bottom center of the frame, resting on a white duvet that occupies the lower portion of the scene. An ornate black metal footboard is situated in the center of the frame in the middle ground. Flanking the bed on the far left and right are two large wooden posts, each with a wall sconce. In the background, a wooden railing is visible behind the footboard. The top half of the frame is occupied by a vaulted ceiling with exposed wooden beams and two large skylights, all located in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a pair of light-skinned, bare feet are visible at the end of a bed, propped up on a white duvet. The person's legs are covered by dark blue sweatpants. The view looks past the feet towards an ornate, black metal footboard with brass-colored finials. Above, a ceiling with exposed wooden beams features six skylight windows. On the wooden posts flanking the bed, wall sconces emit a warm, orange light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from a bed in a room with a high ceiling supported by exposed wooden beams. Six large skylights are set into the ceiling, allowing daylight to enter the otherwise dimly lit space. The ornate, black metal footboard of the bed, featuring brass-colored finials, is positioned in the center of the view. On either side, large wooden posts are fitted with wall sconces that cast a warm, orange glow. A pair of bare feet rest on the white bedding at the bottom of the scene, and a wooden railing is visible in the background, suggesting a loft setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
