    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a single, stylized atomic structure positioned in the center of the frame against a black background. This structure, composed of a central cluster of pink and blue spheres with smaller orange spheres orbiting it, occupies the middle ground. The shot then continuously zooms out, revealing that the central object is one of many identical structures. As the zoom progresses, these structures multiply and arrange themselves into an expanding grid pattern, eventually filling the entire frame from top to bottom and left to right. The final composition is a flat, tiled pattern of these synchronously animating structures, all existing on a single plane in the middle ground. The camera's perspective remains level with the objects throughout the zoom-out.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a dynamic and abstract visual composition, beginning with a central cluster of overlapping, colorful circles in pink, blue, and orange hues. The orange circles appear to orbit around the pink and blue ones, resembling the structure of an atom. As the video progresses, it zooms out to reveal additional circles, organized into similar clusters arranged in a grid pattern. This transformation creates a visually striking and symmetrical display of geometric shapes against a black background, highlighting the contrast and vividness of the colors.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a single, stylized atom-like structure is centered. This structure is composed of a central nucleus of clustered pink and light blue spheres, with several smaller, textured orange spheres orbiting it. The scene transitions as this single element replicates, expanding into a grid. This grid continues to multiply, eventually filling the entire view with a repeating, tiled pattern of the animated atomic structures, all in unison against the black void.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
