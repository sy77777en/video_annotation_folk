    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a low-angle close-up shot of a television screen mounted to the ceiling, positioned in the center of the frame. The camera then zooms out, transitioning to a medium shot that reveals the wider office environment. In the final framing, the television is located in the upper-center of the frame in the middle ground. The backs of two people's heads occupy the foreground, with one in the lower-left and the other in the lower-right. The camera is now positioned at their head level, looking slightly up at the screen. In the middle ground to the right, a white pillar is visible, while other office workers and cubicles occupy the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video takes place in an office setting, featuring a screen hanging from the ceiling displaying a news broadcast. Initially, the screen is the main focus, showing an image with text at the bottom. As the camera zooms out, two people become visible in the foreground. The person in the lower-left corner, wearing a white shirt with a black plaid pattern, has short, dark hair, while the person in the lower-right corner, wearing a blue shirt and glasses, has short hair. Both are looking at the screen. The office environment includes desks, overhead lighting, and some people visible in the instance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a spacious, open-plan office with a tiled ceiling and fluorescent lighting, a black, boxy television is mounted and angled downward. Two people in the foreground, one on each side, look up at the TV. The screen displays news footage of a skyscraper with a large plume of dark smoke rising from it, accompanied by a news ticker at the bottom. The office space is filled with cubicles and desks, and a white pillar in the background has a sign that reads \"BARCLAYS STOCKBROKERS.\" Several people are gathered in the background, likely watching a screen in front of them.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in an office setting, where two people are looking at a screen hanging from the ceiling. The scene begins with a full shot of the screen, and then the camera zooms out to reveal the two people in the foreground, with only their heads visible. One is positioned in the lower-left corner, and the other in the lower-right corner of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
