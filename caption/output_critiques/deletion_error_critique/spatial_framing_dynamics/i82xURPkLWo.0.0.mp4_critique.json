    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a modern train station. A high-speed train is initially stationary on the tracks in the center-left of the frame, extending from the middle ground towards the background. The station platform occupies the right half of the frame, with a woman pulling a suitcase in the foreground on the right, walking away from the camera. The station's white, latticed roof structure dominates the top of the frame. In the middle ground, other people are visible on the platform and on escalators to the right of the train. The train then begins to move from right to left, passing the static, eye-level camera and eventually filling the left side of the frame. In the background on the right, a cityscape is visible on a hillside. Towards the end of the shot, white text identifying the location as \"Liège, Belgium\" appears in the bottom center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot featuring a modern train station with sleek, futuristic architecture. The station is characterized by its expansive glass and steel structures, casting intricate shadows on the platform. A high-speed train, with a streamlined design and blue accents, is prominently visible, emphasizing the station's role as a hub of transportation. The scene includes a few individuals walking back and forth on the platform, adding a subtle human element to the environment. The focus is on the atmosphere, highlighting the blend of modern engineering, urban life, and human presence, capturing the dynamic interaction between the train, the station, and the people, illustrating the scale and functionality of the space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A sleek, white high-speed train with blue and grey stripes moves along the tracks at a modern, open-air train station in Liège, Belgium. The station features a distinctive white, latticed roof with sweeping, curved support structures over a spacious grey platform. A few people are visible on the platform, including a woman pulling a suitcase, and some individuals are using the escalator while others walk upward. In the background, under a partly cloudy sky, a city with traditional buildings is visible on a hillside. At the end of the video, the location is confirmed as Liège, Belgium, through a white text overlay at the bottom of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
