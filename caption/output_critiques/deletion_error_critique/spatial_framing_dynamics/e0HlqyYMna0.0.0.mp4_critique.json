    "pre_caption": "Initially, the skier is framed in a medium shot in the bottom right foreground, with the majority of the frame presenting a wide shot of a vast, snowy mountain landscape. The immediate slope dominates the scene, descending from the top right, while distant mountains and a valley are visible in the top left background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, providing a forward-looking perspective. As the skier begins to descend, they move toward the center of the frame. The camera simultaneously tilts downward, shifting the perspective to a view from above the skier's path, with their shadow appearing on the snow in the foreground to their left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a person, presumably a skier or snowboarder, sliding down a steep snowy mountain. The individual is seen from the waist up, wearing a black helmet with a white rectangular strap buckle on the back and a green circular logo on the front. They are dressed in a hooded jacket with a colorful abstract pattern in shades of purple, pink, and blue, and are carrying a black backpack.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video captures a daytime scene in a vast, snow-covered mountain range under a clear blue sky. The footage follows a person wearing a multi-colored jacket in shades of purple and blue, along with a black helmet, as they move down a steep, snowy slope. The mountainside features some exposed rocky outcrops and existing tracks in the snow. In the distance, a wide valley containing a body of water is visible between the surrounding peaks.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a skier in a medium shot with only the upper body visible, but most of the frame presents a wide shot of the snowy mountain landscape.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
