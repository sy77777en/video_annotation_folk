    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a control room, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. In the left foreground and middle ground, several men in teal uniforms are positioned at large control consoles. In the right middle ground, a group of men is seated at a desk, while another man stands behind them. The background is filled by a wall of server racks that spans the width of the frame. Throughout the shot, white text reading \"MARCH 8th, 1968\" is superimposed in the bottom-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a group of men with a uniform, stylized, and mannequin-like appearance, all having pale skin and no distinct facial features. They are dressed in matching teal-colored uniforms consisting of a long-sleeved jacket, trousers, and a peaked cap. Some of the men wear tall black boots. The figures are engaged in various activities within a room containing large, vintage-style computer equipment. Several men stand at large, dark grey control consoles, while others are seated in office chairs at desks, interacting with early computer terminals. A few other men are standing in different parts of the room, some near the large, dark grey server racks with glowing green lights that line the back wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, stylized control room with a muted color palette. The back wall is lined with rows of dark gray mainframe computer cabinets featuring glowing green screens. In the center and foreground are large, dark gray control consoles. The room, which has a light gray floor and dark gray walls, is illuminated by several white, cylindrical fluorescent lights suspended from the ceiling. Figures dressed in teal uniforms and caps are positioned throughout the space; some stand at the consoles, while others are seated in office chairs at a desk on the right. An overlay of white text appears in the lower-left corner, reading, \"MARCH 8th, 1968.\"**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
