    "pre_caption": "This scenery video is presented as an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective. A vast prairie occupies the bottom portion of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background horizon. A massive storm cloud system dominates the top and center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. Several distinct rain shafts fall from the base of the clouds in the center and right of the frame, connecting the sky to the land in the background. The camera slowly moves forward, pushing into the scene toward the center of the storm, causing the turbulent clouds and central rain shaft to grow larger and more prominent within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic weather event. A massive, turbulent system of dark grey storm clouds dominates the sky, hanging low over a vast, open plain of green and yellow grasslands. Distinct columns of heavy rain, or rain shafts, can be seen falling from the base of the clouds, connecting the ominous sky to the distant horizon. There is no main subject, as the video's focus is on conveying the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the storm over the expansive natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, a vast, open prairie of green and yellow-brown grass stretches to the horizon. The sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent storm system with dark gray and black clouds swirling. Below the dark base of the clouds, several distinct shafts of heavy rain are visible, falling onto the distant landscape. A faint, light-colored road winds through the prairie in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
