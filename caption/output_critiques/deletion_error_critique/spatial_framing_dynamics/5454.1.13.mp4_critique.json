    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up, a man occupies the center foreground of the frame, captured from a low-angle perspective. His gloved hand is also in the foreground, positioned in the bottom left and center, with his index finger pointing upward toward the top of the frame. In the background, several other people are visible in the center and top right, while bare tree branches are situated in the top left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with brown skin, short dark braids, and a tattoo on his forehead looks down at the camera, which is positioned at a low angle. He wears a dark jacket with large white text across the chest and black gloves. He holds one gloved hand up with his index finger pointing towards the area above the camera. Behind him, several other people are visible as dark silhouettes standing against the bright, overcast sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene from a low-angle perspective, looking up towards an overcast, grey sky. A man wearing a dark jacket with a white background and dark lettering initially looks down at the camera before extending their gloved index finger. His head is positioned in the middle ground, with their clothing and right hand in black gloves clearly visible in the foreground,. Bare tree branches frame the upper portion of the view. At the top of what appears to be a staircase, several figures are silhouetted against the dim, daytime light, with their faces not visible, making it unclear if they are looking at the sky or the staircase. Some individuals seem to be leaning against a railing, adding ambiguity to the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
