    "pre_caption": "This video is a static, low-angle extreme wide shot of a cityscape scenery. The Arc de Triomphe stands as the central element, positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame. A wide road extends from the bottom of the frame in the foreground, leading toward the monument in the middle ground. On the left and right sides of the frame, illuminated trees are situated in the middle ground. The primary dynamic within the static shot is the time-lapsed traffic, which creates continuous streaks of light that flow along the road in the foreground and middle ground. A text overlay is positioned in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot centered on the illuminated Arc de Triomphe in Paris at night. The grand, neoclassical monument stands at the end of a wet, reflective cobblestone road, flanked by trees with warm, golden foliage under bright streetlights. The scene is brought to life by a time-lapse effect, which transforms the headlights and taillights of passing vehicles into long, flowing streaks of white, blue, and red light, creating a powerful sense of motion and energy. There is no single main subject, as the composition's focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere, scale, and ceaseless vitality of the iconic urban environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A night scene captures the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, positioned centrally at the end of a wide, wet road. The large, stone monument is illuminated with white light, highlighting its detailed carvings. On either side of the road, trees with yellow leaves are lit by warm streetlights. The dark, wet pavement reflects the ambient light and the motion of traffic, which appears as continuous, blurred streaks of red and white light flowing towards and away from the arch. In the bottom right corner, an overlay displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ\" and \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
