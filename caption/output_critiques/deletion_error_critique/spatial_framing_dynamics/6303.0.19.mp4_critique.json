    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a person is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame. Their right arm, initially raised with a clenched fist, moves towards the camera and then retracts, remaining in the foreground and center. In the background, a dome-shaped hair dryer is visible in the top center. To the left in the background, a large circular mirror is present, and slightly to its right, a wooden shelving unit with vertical orange light strips is also in the background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light skin is featured, smiling towards the camera. She has short, light-colored hair styled with several large, orange hair curlers. She is wearing large, white, rectangular-framed sunglasses and a dark brown robe or dressing gown draped over her shoulders. A beaded bracelet with orange and brown beads is visible on her right wrist, and her right arm is raised with a clenched fist moving towards the camera, then she retracts her arm.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a dimly lit salon or dressing room. A prominent, dome-shaped hair dryer, colored blue and white, is visible in the upper center. To the left, a large, circular mirror reflects a black and white checkered pattern. Vertical, glowing orange light strips are positioned near a wooden shelving unit in the background. The overall lighting is moody, with teals and blues dominating the ambiance, punctuated by the warm orange lights. A person with curlers in their hair and wearing white, square-rimmed sunglasses is in the foreground, moving slightly.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
