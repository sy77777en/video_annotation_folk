    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a black pen with a gold tip and silver accents, suspended horizontally in midair near the center of the frame and positioned in the foreground, with the camera at the pen’s level. The pen is close to the camera, occupying the central foreground, while the rows of dark seats and the aisle recede into the background, creating a sense of depth. The word \"CAUTION\" is visible on the seatbacks along the aisle, positioned in the middle ground on both the left and right sides of the frame. The focus then shifts as a woman in a white uniform enters the scene from the background, walking through a doorway at the far end of the aisle, which is centered in the frame. The camera remains at her height, capturing her in a wide shot as she stands upright in the doorway, now making her the main subject in the background, while the pen is no longer the focus. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a straight-on perspective at the subjects’ level, and the spatial composition transitions from the pen in the foreground to the woman in the background, with the central aisle and rows of seats providing clear depth and structure to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a full shot of a black pen with a gold tip and silver accents, seemingly with red liquid on the tip, suspended horizontally in midair. The focus then shifts to a woman who enters the scene, wearing a white uniform with matching pants and a long-sleeved top, and a white cap. She has light skin, and her posture is upright as she opens the door at the end of the aisle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place inside a modern, dimly lit passenger cabin with a flat ceiling above the aisle and sloped ceilings above the seats on either side. The cabin features rows of dark, high-backed seats arranged along a central aisle. The environment is enclosed, with smooth metallic and plastic surfaces, and the lighting is soft, casting subtle reflections along the walls and floor. A small, dark cylindrical pen with a gold tip and silver accents, featuring red liquid on the tip, floats in midair near the camera. The far end of the cabin features a closed doorway with rounded edges, and a person dressed in a light-colored uniform opens the doorway, standing upright and about to walk through. The word \"CAUTION\" in white, capitalized text appears on the seatbacks near the aisle and is part of the physical scene. The overall atmosphere is quiet and controlled, with no visible windows or natural light, suggesting an artificial, possibly futuristic setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
