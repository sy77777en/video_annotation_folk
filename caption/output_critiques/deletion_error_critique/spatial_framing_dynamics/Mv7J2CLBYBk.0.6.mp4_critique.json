    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level. A golf cart with a driver is positioned stationary in the left-middle ground of the frame. To its right, a man is initially seen mid-air in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. The man then moves in an arc downwards and to the right, landing on the floor and finishing his movement on the right side of the frame. The golf cart remains static on the left throughout the clip. The highly reflective floor in the foreground mirrors the stationary cart and the man's entire acrobatic motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man dressed in a black jacket, black pants, and a gray baseball cap performs an acrobatic flip in the air, landing on the shiny, reflective light-gray floor. In the driver's seat of a white and black golf cart is a woman with long brown hair tied back, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and dark pants, holding the steering wheel. The golf cart has black seats and a gray and red logo on its side featuring the letter \"M\" and a star-like symbol. Both the man and the cart are clearly reflected on the polished floor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a spacious, modern indoor hall with white paneled walls and a highly reflective, glossy gray floor that mirrors the surroundings. The area is illuminated by natural sunlight streaming in from the side. A white and black golf cart-style vehicle, featuring a blue and white logo on its side, is positioned in the space. A person dressed in black performs an acrobatic flip in mid-air next to the cart, subsequently landing and rolling on the polished floor. In the background, a white door and a set of double doors with glass panels are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
