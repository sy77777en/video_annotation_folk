    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, framed within the opening of a sliding door. The background, visible through the central opening, shows a harbor scene, while reflections of the same scene are visible on the door panels to the left and right in the middle ground. A lens flare is present in the right foreground. The woman pulls the right door panel towards the left, causing the central opening to narrow as she remains in the center-left of the frame. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult woman with fair skin and wet, blonde hair is seen standing. She is wearing a dark blue, low-cut, one-piece swimsuit, and her skin is visibly wet. The woman opens the door, enters, and then closes it behind her. As she steps inside, she holds a light-colored towel in her left hand, using it to wipe from her left cheek back to the ends of her shoulder-length hair. She is facing forward, with her head turned slightly to her right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is viewed from a brightly lit interior, featuring a translucent sliding door in the midground. As the woman slides the door open, a vibrant harbor at sunset becomes visible, with a greenish-yellow sky over a waterfront lined with buildings, palm trees, and docked boats. Through the unopened translucent section of the door, a deeper and softer reflection of the same harbor is visible. A woman in a blue swimsuit, with wet hair clinging to her shoulders, stands framed by the open gap. She uses a cream-colored towel to dry her face and hair while pulling the door shut behind her. A subtle lens flare appears on the left side of the frame, with a blurred indoor object in the lower right foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
