    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, where a skateboarder is positioned in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, with a large building occupying the background. The camera pans left and zooms in, tracking the skateboarder as he moves across a plaza from right to left. The shot transitions into a medium full shot, bringing the subject into the foreground as he approaches a low, dark stone ledge. He jumps over the ledge, which is in the immediate foreground, and lands on the sidewalk below. During the landing, the skateboarder remains in the center of the frame in the foreground, with a street containing active traffic now visible in the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, continues to pan left, following him as he skates away toward the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with tattoos visible on his neck and left hand is skateboarding. He is wearing an orange long-sleeved sweatshirt with black text on the front, dark blue jeans, a brown belt, and a dark navy beanie. On his feet are light-colored sneakers with dark accents. He rides a skateboard that has a wooden top and white wheels. The man performs a trick, causing the skateboard to flip in the air before he lands back on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a modern urban plaza during the day, adjacent to a street with active traffic. A large, multi-story building with a light-colored facade and a grid of numerous windows with louvered shutters dominates the background. The ground floor of this building features several commercial storefronts. In the center of the plaza, a low, dark, polished stone ledge is present. Cars are parked along the curb and move along the road, while pedestrians walk on the sidewalks. A few green trees are interspersed throughout the scene, along with traffic lights and street lamps. A person on a skateboard moves across the plaza and jumps over the ledge onto the lower sidewalk.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
