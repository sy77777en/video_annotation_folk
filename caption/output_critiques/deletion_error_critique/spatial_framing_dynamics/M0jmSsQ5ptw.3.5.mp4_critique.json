    "pre_caption": "This full shot is captured from a high angle, looking down at a model biplane positioned in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. A thick black rope hangs in the right foreground, suspended from a wooden structure that occupies the top of the frame. To the left, a dry, grassy field extends into the background. On the right, a paved surface runs from the bottom of the frame into the background, where a person on a bicycle is visible. In the far background, mountains are visible across the horizon. The shot is static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A model biplane, painted a light tan color, is the central subject. Its top wing is marked with a large roundel consisting of a blue outer circle, a white middle ring, and a red center. The tail rudder features vertical stripes of blue, white, and red. On the side of the fuselage, a light blue patch displays the red number \"4\". The struts connecting the upper and lower wings are painted with red and white stripes. In the foreground, a thick, black, braided rope hangs down. A bicycle is visible in the background on a paved surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted to a wooden structure, the perspective looks down on a vintage-style model biplane. The scene is set outdoors during the day at an airfield, with a paved runway next to a vast, dry, grassy field. The biplane is tan with a blue, white, and red roundel on the top wing and matching vertical stripes on the tail rudder; its struts are painted with red and white stripes. A person is seated in the plane's open cockpit. In the background, low mountains stand under a partly cloudy sky, and another person can be seen on a bicycle on the runway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
