    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a rural landscape from a high aerial perspective. A stone church with a spire is positioned slightly left of center, occupying the middle ground. A graveyard surrounds the church, primarily visible in the bottom left quadrant and extending towards the center bottom, situated in the foreground and middle ground. A path leads from the bottom left corner towards the church in the middle ground. Clusters of green trees are located in the top left, top center, and bottom right areas, spanning the middle ground and background. A large, golden-brown field dominates the top right and right side of the frame, extending into the background. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures an aerial view of a church surrounded by a mix of lush greenery and golden-brown land. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the contrast between the vibrant green trees and the golden-brown terrain. The church, with its tall spire and stone architecture, blends into the landscape, emphasizing the harmony between human-made structures and nature. The overall atmosphere is serene and expansive, with no single main subject dominating the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an aerial view of a rural landscape featuring a historic stone church with a tall spire. The setting is outdoors, surrounded by a mix of green trees and a golden-brown field, indicating a late summer or early autumn time of day. The church is positioned centrally, with a graveyard visible around it, marked by scattered headstones. The architecture of the church is characterized by its gray stone material and traditional design. The scene is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the textures of the stone and the patterns in the harvested field. The drone's perspective provides a comprehensive view of the church and its surroundings, emphasizing the contrast between the structured architecture and the organic landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
