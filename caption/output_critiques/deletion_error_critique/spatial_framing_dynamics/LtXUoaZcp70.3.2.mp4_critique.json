    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a blue 3D model of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is positioned on a brown, gridded floor that occupies the bottom of the frame, set against a black background. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms out, causing the man to appear smaller and transitioning the view into a long shot. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 3D model of a man, rendered entirely in a shimmering, textured blue color, stands in a static pose. He is depicted wearing what appears to be a historical military uniform, consisting of a belted tunic, loose-fitting trousers, and tall boots. The man is standing at attention, with his head tilted up and to his left. His right hand rests near his waist, and his left arm is held behind his back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space, a full-length, blue, crystalline figure of a person stands at the center. The figure is dressed in a uniform-style outfit with a tunic, pants, and tall boots. It is positioned on a brown, textured floor marked with a glowing golden grid pattern that extends into the distance against a solid black background. The camera slowly zooms out from the figure. White overlay text \"[34,35]\" is positioned at the lower left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
