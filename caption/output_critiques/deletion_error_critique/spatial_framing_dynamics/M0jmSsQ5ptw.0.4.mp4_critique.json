    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, with a man in a blue shirt standing on a raised platform in the center-right foreground, next to a golf bag. A black ramp is positioned in the left middle ground, with a large blue inflatable structure further to the left. Mountains are visible in the background. As the camera zooms out to a wide shot, a wooden seesaw with a small tricycle on it becomes visible in the left middle ground. A second man in a yellow shirt walks into the frame from the left, approaches the seesaw, picks up a skateboard, and walks back toward the left edge of the frame. The man on the platform remains in the center-right foreground, preparing his golf swing. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light skin tone, wearing a blue short-sleeved polo shirt, white pants, and a white hat, stands on a raised platform covered in artificial grass. He holds a golf club and wears a white glove on his left hand, positioned next to a large grey and orange golf bag. To the left, another man with a light skin tone, dressed in a yellow short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, walks over to a skateboard, picks it up, and then turns to walk away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a large, paved expanse under a partly cloudy sky, with mountains visible in the distance, a scene is set up for an activity. In the foreground, a raised, black-draped platform is topped with artificial green turf. Next to it stands a black ramp. In the middle ground, there is a large, blue and black inflatable structure and a wooden seesaw with a small tricycle on one end. A person in golf attire stands on the platform next to a golf bag. An overlay of white text reading \"RICKIE FOWLER\" is positioned across the top of the raised, black-draped platform.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
