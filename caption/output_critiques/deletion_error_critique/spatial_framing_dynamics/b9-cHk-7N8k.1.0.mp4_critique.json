    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a wide shot from a camera positioned at the subject's level. In the foreground, the front of a watercraft is visible at the bottom of the frame. A person on a jet ski is located in the middle ground, starting on the left side of the frame and moving horizontally to the right before exiting the frame. In the background, large canyon walls occupy the top, left, and right portions of the frame, with their reflections appearing on the water that extends from the foreground to the background. The entire scene moves forward from the perspective of the foreground watercraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light brown hair, wearing orange and black clothing, rides a white and green jet ski from left to right across the water, creating a white wake. The rider and their jet ski proceed to move out of the frame to the right. In the foreground at the bottom of the scene, the front portion of a second jet ski is visible, featuring white and yellow-green coloring, and it is moving forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view from a watercraft moving through a canyon on a bright, sunny day. The scene is dominated by towering, reddish-orange sandstone cliffs that rise steeply from the edge of a calm, dark green body of water. Under a clear blue sky, the layered rock formations are perfectly reflected on the water's glassy surface. Ahead, another person on a jet ski speeds across the water, leaving a prominent white wake behind them. The front of the viewer's own watercraft is visible at the bottom of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
