    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a city street, focusing on a woman walking away from the camera. Her upper body is visible in the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The camera follows her at her height, maintaining her as the central subject. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, occupying the middle ground and background, with their facades extending vertically. Streetlights are positioned in the middle ground, slightly to the right, casting a warm glow. The camera movement is smooth, keeping the woman centered while the urban environment unfolds around her, providing a consistent view of the street's architecture and atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wide shot of a city street, focusing on a woman walking away from the camera. She is seen from behind, with only her upper body visible. The woman has light-colored hair and is wearing a black coat. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the scene captures the urban environment with its architecture and streetlights. The camera follows her as she walks, maintaining her as the central subject while providing context of the bustling city around her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an urban street scene in a city with tall, imposing buildings lining both sides of the road. The setting is outdoors, and the time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky is overcast with a soft, diffused light. The architecture is characterized by a mix of modern and older stone buildings, with intricate details visible on some facades. The street is relatively quiet, with a few cars and bicycles visible, and a pedestrian walking along the sidewalk. Streetlights cast a warm glow, contrasting with the cooler tones of the buildings and pavement. The overall atmosphere is calm, with minimal movement, and the scene maintains a consistent urban aesthetic throughout.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A wide shot of a city street, with the camera following a woman from behind as she walks. The video only shows the upper body of the woman, leaving more context for the street scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
