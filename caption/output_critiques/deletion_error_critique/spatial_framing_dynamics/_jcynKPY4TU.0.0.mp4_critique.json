    "pre_caption": "A wide shot captures a promenade from a static, approximately eye-level perspective. A paved path extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame, through the middle ground in the center, and into the background. A continuous, time-lapsed flow of pedestrians moves along this path in the middle ground, with individuals walking both towards and away from the camera. In the foreground on the bottom right, a man remains seated on a bench, serving as a relatively stationary element. The background is composed of buildings and lush green trees on the left and right, with a white canopy visible in the center-background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A diverse group of pedestrians, including men and women of various ages, walk along a paved path. The people are dressed in casual attire such as t-shirts, jeans, and jackets in various colors. Throughout the time-lapse sequence, different individuals move through the scene. Notable figures include a man in a blue jacket pushing a wheeled shopping bag, walking away from the viewer. On the right, an older man with light skin, wearing light grey striped clothing with a grey-blue vest, remains seated on a wooden bench, providing a relatively stationary point of reference amidst the moving crowd, though he exhibits slight movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video captures a bustling outdoor promenade on a bright, sunny day. The scene is set on a wide, paved walkway where numerous people in casual clothing stroll. The path is flanked by lush, green trees, and in the background, there are low buildings, a white canopy, and a tree with peach-colored blossoms. On the right, a man sits on a wooden bench. The entire scene is presented with a strong tilt-shift effect, which blurs the upper and lower portions of the view, giving it a miniaturized look with saturated colors.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
