    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a man in profile, positioned in the center-left foreground, looking down and toward the right of the frame. In the top left background, a shelf with the number \"2\" is visible. A dark curtain hangs in the background on the right side of the frame. The camera is static and positioned at the man's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, light brown hair is shown in a close-up profile view. He is wearing a dark gray crewneck sweatshirt over a collared shirt, with the collar visible at his neck. His head is tilted downward, and he has a focused, intense expression as he looks toward something out of frame to his right. The lighting highlights the side of his face, casting the rest of his features and the surroundings in deep shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit interior, a young man is captured in profile, his face illuminated by a single light source against a dark background. Behind him, a horizontal surface, possibly a shelf or bunk, is visible, marked with a yellow label bearing the number \"2\" in black. The scene is predominantly monochromatic, with deep shadows and shades of grey dominating the composition. To the right, a dark curtain hangs, partially obscuring the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
