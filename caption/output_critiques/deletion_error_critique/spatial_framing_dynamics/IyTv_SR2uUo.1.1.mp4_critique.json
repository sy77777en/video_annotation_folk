    "pre_caption": "From a rear-facing perspective mounted on a motorcycle, the rider's back is positioned in the center of the frame, with the tail of their bike occupying the bottom left foreground. At the start, the front wheel of another motorcycle is visible in the top right foreground before it quickly moves out of the frame to the right. A second motorcycle is located in the middle ground to the right of the main rider, and a third is further back in the middle ground, also on the right. As the camera's vehicle advances, it overtakes the second motorcycle, which moves from the right, across the top of the frame, and exits at the top left. The third motorcycle remains in the middle ground on the right. The rider's shadow is cast onto the track in the right foreground and middle ground, moving along with the camera. The paved track fills the lower and central portions of the frame, receding into the background where the sky is visible at the top. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a rear-facing perspective on a motorcycle, a racer is seen in a crouched position. This person is wearing a blue, white, and black leather racing suit with the word \"MEGLIO\" in white lettering with a black outline across the lower back. A portion of the motorcycle's white tail section, featuring a black stylized \"io\" logo, is visible on the left. Alongside and slightly ahead, another racer on a red, orange, and white motorcycle is wearing a red, orange, and white suit, who later exits the frame from the top right as the camera passes them. Further in the distance, a third racer in a red and white suit rides a similar red and white motorcycle. At the very beginning, the front wheel and part of the front fairing of a red and white motorcycle are also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to the rear of a motorcycle, captures a race from a slightly higher angle on a paved track. During a bright, sunny day under a blue sky with scattered clouds, the camera looks forward over the back of a rider in blue, white, and black leathers that have the word \"MEGLIO\" in white text. The dark shadow of the rider and their vehicle is cast onto the gray asphalt. Other racers on motorcycles, including one in red and white, are in close proximity, maneuvering on the track to the side.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A camera is mounted on the rear of a motorcycle, capturing part of the motorcycle and its rider. At the same time, the camera also records other motorcycles and the people riding them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
