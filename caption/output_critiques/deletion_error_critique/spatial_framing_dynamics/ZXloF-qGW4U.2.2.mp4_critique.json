    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A dark metal railing occupies the foreground, running horizontally across the lower half of the screen. The man walks from right to left, and the camera pans to track his movement, keeping him consistently in the right half of the frame. As the camera pans, the background scenery, which includes storefronts with neon signs, moves from right to left behind him. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, short hair walks outside from a store at night. He is wearing a dark suit jacket over a collared shirt and dark trousers. He moves from right to left, walking alongside a dark metal railing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a man in a dark suit walks outside from a store, situated in the middle ground of the scene. In the foreground, a dark metal railing is visible. The city is illuminated by an array of vibrant neon signs in teal, blue, and pink that adorn the storefronts. Many of the signs feature Korean script. Through the large glass windows of the shops, white refrigerated cases are visible. The entire environment is bathed in a cool, greenish-blue light cast by the glowing signs.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
