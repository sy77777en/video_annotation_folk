    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a cityscape scenery. The steel structure and suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, framing the scene from the bottom, top, and sides. From the camera's elevated position, blurred light streaks from traffic are visible in the bottom center of the frame, moving away from the viewer into the middle ground. To the right, a pedestrian walkway with a few figures is situated in the middle ground. In the background, the Manhattan skyline extends across the center of the frame, set behind the bridge's structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot captured from the Brooklyn Bridge, looking towards the Manhattan skyline during the twilight hour. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the grand scale and bustling atmosphere of the urban environment. The intricate steel structure and suspension cables of the bridge frame the scene, leading the eye towards the distant skyscrapers silhouetted against a soft, pastel-hued sky. Below, on the bridge's roadway, the movement of traffic is captured with a long exposure effect, transforming the vehicles' headlights and taillights into continuous, glowing streaks of red and white light that contrast with the city. Some people are visible on the elevated pedestrian walkway to the right, dwarfed by the immense scale of the bridge and the sprawling metropolis beyond.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a vantage point on the Brooklyn Bridge's pedestrian walkway at dawn or dusk, the Manhattan skyline is visible in the background. The bridge's steel structure, with its network of suspension cables, frames the view. Below, traffic flows in multiple lanes, the cars' lights creating long, blurred streaks of red and white. The skyscrapers of the city are silhouetted against a pink and orange sky, with lights visible in their windows. Some figures are visible on the elevated pedestrian walkway to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
