    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing both the shoes and the suitcase in full view within the frame. Initially, the shoes are positioned near the bottom right of the frame in the foreground, while the blue suitcase sits further to the right, also in the foreground, with its open lid facing upward and some light-colored fabric visible inside. The background consists of a blue wall with white closet doors centered and an electrical outlet to the right. As the video progresses, the shoes move from their initial spot toward the suitcase, crossing the floor from the right side of the frame into the suitcase, which remains stationary. Once the shoes enter the suitcase, they are visible inside it, and the suitcase lid begins to close over them. Throughout the video, the camera remains at the same height as the shoes and suitcase, maintaining a straight-on, eye-level perspective without tilting or panning. The spatial relationship between the shoes and suitcase shifts from separated to combined, with the shoes transitioning from outside to inside the suitcase, while all elements remain in the foreground relative to the room’s depth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a pair of dark brown, worn leather shoes and a blue hard-shell suitcase with a completely open lid. The shoes are positioned upright and close together. The suitcase is medium-sized, rectangular, and sits on the floor with its lid propped open, revealing a glimpse of light-colored clothing or fabric inside. Initially, the shoes are seen outside the suitcase. Then, they appear to move inside the suitcase on their own, and as they finally enter, the lid begins to close over them. No people or other living beings are visible, and the focus remains on the shoes and suitcase as the primary subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a sparsely furnished room with wooden floorboards and a blue, textured wall. A set of white, louvered closet doors is centered against the back wall, and a beige electrical outlet is visible nearby. The lighting suggests daytime, with soft, even illumination and no strong shadows. On the floor, a dark brown, worn pair of shoes and a blue suitcase with a hard shell are present; the suitcase is completely open, revealing some light-colored fabric inside. The shoes and suitcase are positioned apart from each other. As the video proceeds, the shoes gradually move into the suitcase on their own, and then the lid is about to close. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
