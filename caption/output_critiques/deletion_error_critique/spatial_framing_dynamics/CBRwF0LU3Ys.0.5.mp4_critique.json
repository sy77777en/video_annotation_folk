    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle medium shot, capturing the front of a Porsche as it moves from the bottom right towards the top left of the frame. The camera then pulls back and lowers to the car's height, transitioning to a full shot that frames the vehicle in the center foreground as it drives towards the viewer, with snow-covered ground in the foreground and background trees on the right. Following a rapid high-angle shot of the car's roof, the camera drops back to the car's level and moves alongside it, framing the vehicle's blue side in a medium shot as it drifts from the right side of the frame to the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a Porsche car with a distinctive split-color livery. The driver's side of the car is red, and the passenger's side is blue, with a white stripe running down the center of the hood and roof. On the red side of the hood, a large white circle contains the text \"+30°\" in red. Correspondingly, the blue side features a white circle with \"-30°\" in blue text. The word \"PORSCHE\" is written in white capital letters across the top of the windshield. A hashtag, \"#Drive2Extremes,\" is visible in white on the red side of the car. The vehicle's German license plate reads \"S·VG 1015E\". The car is shown from various angles, including a top-down view, a front view, and side views.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone follows a Porsche sports car as it drifts at speed across a vast, snow-covered landscape. The car features a distinctive split livery, with one side blue and marked \"-30°\" and the other red with \"+30°\". The dynamic camera shots capture the vehicle from various angles—overhead, from the front, and alongside—as its tires kick up clouds of white snow. In the background, a dense forest of snow-dusted evergreen trees lines the track under a bright, clear sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins with a medium shot of the front section of a Porsche from the side. The camera then moves backward to reveal a full front view of the car, before circling to the opposite side and transitioning back into a medium shot. Finally, it transitions to a full shot of the car, filmed from its right rear side.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera height starts above the subject, briefly moves to at the same height as the subject, then returns to above the subject, and finally goes back to at the same height as the subject.",
