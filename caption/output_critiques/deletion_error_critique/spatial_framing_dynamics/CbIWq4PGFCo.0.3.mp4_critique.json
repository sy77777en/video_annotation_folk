    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young man in profile, positioned in the foreground and occupying the lower central portion of the frame as he faces toward the right. In the background, a dark, sloping hill extends from the top left toward the center. A lighter, flat expanse is visible in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, curly brown hair is shown in a close-up profile view, looking toward his own front, which is the right side of the frame. He is wearing a dark, possibly black, shirt. His expression is somber and contemplative as he sits in a dimly lit environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a vast, desolate landscape at twilight. A flat, lighter-colored expanse occupies the mid-ground, with a dark, sloping hill visible in the background under a deep blue sky. The ground appears dark and sandy, dotted with a few sparse, out-of-focus bushes. The lighting is low and warm-toned, casting the foreground largely in shadow while a faint light catches the distant plain. A young man with brown hair, wearing a dark shirt, is positioned in the foreground, seen in profile looking towards the right of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
