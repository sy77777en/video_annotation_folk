    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot at the players' level, positioning the main action in the middle ground. The shooter in the black jersey occupies the center of the frame, with opposing players in white jerseys surrounding him on the left and right. Another player in black stands on the far left, and the stadium audience is visible in the background. As the ball is released, the camera tilts upward and zooms in, following its trajectory. The shot transitions to a low-angle close-up from below the basket, where the hoop and net are centered in the foreground. The basketball then enters the frame from the top-center and passes through the net, with the backboard's support structure visible in the top-left foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a basketball game, a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the white number 3 is in mid-air, shooting an orange basketball with his right hand. He wears black shorts with a red stripe and black leggings. Attempting to block the shot are three opposing players in white \"SIXERS\" jerseys with white shorts featuring blue stripes. One player, with his arm raised high, wears a jersey with a partially visible red number. To his right, another player in a jersey with the red number 11 also jumps to block. A third player, wearing the number 12 in red, stands directly beside the shooter. Other players, including a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the number 50, watch the play. The camera follows the orange basketball as it arcs toward the hoop and falls through the white net of the basket, which is attached to a blue and red support structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, indoor basketball arena filled with spectators in tiered seating that surrounds a polished wooden court. A basketball player in a black and red uniform is in mid-air, shooting an orange basketball. Several opposing players in white and blue uniforms are attempting to block the shot. The ball travels in an arc toward the basket, which consists of an orange rim and a white net. The hoop is attached to a transparent backboard, which is mounted on a red and blue support structure featuring the text \"NBA TV\" in white and the official NBA logo. The ball is shown passing cleanly through the net.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a basketball game in a stadium with a packed audience in the background. In the foreground, several players are in action, including a player in black attempting a shot while a player in white jumps to block. The camera then zooms in on the basketball as it goes into the basket.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to below the subject.",
