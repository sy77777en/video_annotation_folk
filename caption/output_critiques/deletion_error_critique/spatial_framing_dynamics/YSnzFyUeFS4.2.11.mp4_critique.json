    "pre_caption": "This eye-level, first-person shot moves forward along a sidewalk, framed by metal scaffolding that occupies the foreground and the top of the frame. A person stands in the right foreground next to a closed security gate. The sidewalk extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground, with long shadows stretching across it from left to right. To the left, a street is visible in the middle ground, where pedestrians cross from right to left. A yellow taxi is positioned in the center-left middle ground. In the background, buildings line the far side of the street. A bright sun in the top left creates a lens flare that moves with the camera's forward motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a bustling street scene from a first-person perspective, walking along a sidewalk under metal scaffolding. The scaffolding, made of metal poles and a corrugated metal roof, casts long shadows across the concrete pavement in the bright sunlight. In the background, pedestrians in casual clothing, such as t-shirts and shorts, cross the street at an intersection. A yellow taxi cab is visible on the street in the midground. The sun is low in the sky, creating a significant lens flare, adding to the dynamic urban atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a late afternoon scene on a city street. The perspective is from beneath metal scaffolding with a corrugated roof that covers a concrete sidewalk, where long shadows are cast by the low sun. A bright lens flare from the sun is visible. Across the street, which is marked with white painted lines, pedestrians walk past brick buildings, and a yellow taxi can be seen in the distance. To the right, a person stands near a storefront with its gray, roll-down security gate closed.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
