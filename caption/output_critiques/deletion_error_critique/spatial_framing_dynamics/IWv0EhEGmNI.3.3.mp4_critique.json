    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot of a valley, where a glowing line is positioned in the bottom center foreground. Buildings and trees occupy the middle ground on the left and right, with a vertical HUD element on the far left. The camera then tilts down, introducing a rifle into the bottom right foreground and establishing a first-person perspective. The glowing line is now seen as a rope extending from the left foreground downwards. The camera moves forward and down, maintaining the high-angle view, shifting focus from the wide valley to a wooden structure that comes into view in the center middle ground below. The rifle remains stationary in the bottom right foreground, while HUD elements are consistently visible in the bottom left and bottom right corners.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a first-person perspective. It begins with a wide shot showing a rope with a glowing appearance, enhanced by the night vision effect, being thrown into a valley, with distant buildings and trees visible. The scene transitions to a high-angle shot of a gun pointed downward, capturing a wide view of the valley and a rooftop below. The setting is dark, with a greenish tint, suggesting night vision or a similar effect.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot set in a dark, outdoor environment at night. The scene unfolds in a dimly lit urban area with several buildings visible in the distance, their windows faintly illuminated. The atmosphere is enhanced by a green night-vision effect, creating a distinct visual style. The setting includes a mix of natural and architectural elements, such as trees and structures, under a dark sky. A notable visual element is a glowing line that winds through the scene, adding a dynamic aspect to the otherwise static environment. The video also features overlays, including text and icons, which are positioned on the screen, providing additional information without being part of the physical setting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a first-person perspective throughout. It begins with a wide shot of a glowing rope being thrown down into a valley, showing distant buildings and trees. The camera then tilts downward, and a gun shows in the right foreground. The shot continues with a high-angle wide shot of the valley, capturing a rooftop below.",
