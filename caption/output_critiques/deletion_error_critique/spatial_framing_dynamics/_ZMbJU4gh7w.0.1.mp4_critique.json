    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing a woman on the left and a man on the center-right, both positioned in the middle ground. A vintage car is partially visible on the far right, with a stone wall on the left and a large door forming the background. The two figures then walk toward the right and away from the camera, causing the framing to transition into a full shot that reveals the entire car in the middle ground. The woman moves from the left to the right side of the frame, getting into the car's passenger seat. Simultaneously, the man walks from the center to the left side of the frame, positioning himself by the driver's door. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A smiling woman and a man stand next to a vintage car in a dimly lit setting. The woman has long, light-colored hair partially covered by a striped grey, white, and brown headscarf. She is wearing a long-sleeved coat or dress with a shiny, yellow and brown snakeskin pattern. The man, who is also smiling, has dark, shoulder-length hair and is dressed in 18th-century-style clothing, including a dark green velvet frock coat and a large, ruffled white cravat. The woman walks to the passenger side of the dark-colored convertible and gets in, while the man walks to the other side of the vehicle and opens the door. The car has large, round headlights and a prominent front grille.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night in a dimly lit driveway or garage, flanked by walls constructed from light-colored stone blocks. A large, dark red garage door serves as the background. The space is sparsely illuminated by warm lights from the wall sconces, with some sources not visible. A dark, vintage convertible is parked in the driveway. The car has a classic design with large, round headlights and a chrome grille. Two figures approach the car; one enters the passenger side while the other opens the driver's door.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
