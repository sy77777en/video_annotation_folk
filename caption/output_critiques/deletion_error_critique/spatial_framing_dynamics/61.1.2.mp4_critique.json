    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man positioned slightly to the right of the center in the frame, occupying the foreground. He is engaged in conversation, with visible hand gestures that emphasize his points. The camera is at the subject's eye level, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the scene. In the background, another person is partially visible, positioned slightly to the left, adding depth to the composition. This person is in the middle ground, with their features less distinct. The setting includes warm lighting and a striped fabric pattern, contributing to the cozy atmosphere. The camera remains steady, focusing on the man's expressions and gestures, while subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium skin tone and a short, neatly trimmed beard. He is wearing a light-colored shirt with a dark pattern and has short hair. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation, as his facial expressions change from a slight grimace to a more focused look. He gestures with his hand, emphasizing his points. In the background, another person is partially visible, wearing a colorful, striped shirt, but their features are not clear. The setting suggests an indoor environment, possibly a restaurant or café.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting, likely a cozy, dimly lit restaurant or bar, with an over-the-shoulder POV showing a character's upper body and the scene ahead. The environment features warm lighting, with a mix of red and green hues creating a relaxed atmosphere. The background includes a striped fabric pattern, possibly on a booth or seat, adding a touch of color and texture. The character is engaged in conversation, with visible gestures. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom, displaying dialogue in yellow text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
