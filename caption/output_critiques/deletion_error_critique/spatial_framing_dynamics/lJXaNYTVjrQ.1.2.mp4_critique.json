    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up shot, featuring a shirtless young man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, holding an unlit cigarette to his lips. Flanking him in the background are two candelabras, one on the left and one on the right, each holding several lit white candles. A hand, with a white sleeve visible, enters the frame from the left foreground and moves towards the center, using a silver lighter in the foreground to light the man's cigarette, which remains in the center middle ground. The man then inhales from the lit cigarette. As he exhales a large plume of white smoke that billows from the center middle ground towards the foreground, the camera zooms in, transitioning to a close-up shot that focuses on his face and the smoke. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a shirtless young man with short brown hair and a silver chain necklace, who initially brings an unlit cigarette to his lips. Another person's hand, with a white sleeve visible, enters the frame and uses a silver lighter to light the cigarette. The man then inhales from the lit cigarette and exhales a large plume of white smoke. On either side of the man, in the dark background, are candelabras with lit candles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a dark indoor environment, illuminated by two candelabras, each holding multiple lit white candles, positioned on either side of a shirtless young man. The man wears a silver chain necklace and initially brings an unlit hand-rolled cigarette to his lips. Another hand, identifiable by a white sleeve, enters the frame from the left and uses a silver lighter to ignite the cigarette. The man then inhales from the lit cigarette and exhales a plume of white smoke as the camera zooms in slightly, focusing on his face and the smoke.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
