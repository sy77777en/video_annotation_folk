    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a white-haired soccer player in a white uniform occupies the foreground, his body angled from the bottom left towards the center of the frame. He is captured mid-air, executing a kick as his leg extends upward. In the middle ground, two players in red uniforms are positioned to the right of center, reacting to the kick, with a fourth player in a white uniform visible between and behind them. A soccer goal is situated in the background on the left side of the frame. The scene is filmed from a low, tilted camera angle, looking up at the action on the vibrant green field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an anime-style scene on a soccer field, five male characters are depicted in a moment of action. In the foreground, a man with white hair is shown from behind in a dynamic, mid-air pose. He wears a white and black soccer uniform with the number 7 on the back. In the midground, two other men in red and black soccer uniforms react to him; one has dark green hair and wears a red harness over his jersey, while the other has dark brown, bowl-cut hair. A fourth man, wearing a white and black uniform similar to the midground character, is positioned between the two players in red. In the background, the fifth man is the goalkeeper for the red team.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a vibrant green soccer pitch during the daytime. White painted lines, including the penalty arc, are visible on the grass. In the background, a white-framed soccer goal with a net stands at one end of the field. Several players in different uniforms—some in white and black, others in red and black—are positioned across the pitch in dynamic poses. The perspective is low and tilted, looking up the field towards the action near the goal.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
