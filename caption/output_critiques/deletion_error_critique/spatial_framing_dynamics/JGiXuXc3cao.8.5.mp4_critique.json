    "pre_caption": "An animated submersible is positioned in the center of the frame, suspended in the middle ground against a dark, greenish-blue background. Below it, in the foreground, its lights illuminate a portion of a large, rocky structure on the seafloor, which initially occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high angle looking down, slowly pulls back and tilts upward. This movement reveals more of the seafloor structure in the bottom-left and center-bottom areas of the frame, while the submersible remains stationary in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated, blue-toned submersible vehicle is shown against a dark, greenish-blue background, suggesting a deep-sea environment. The vehicle has an elongated, rectangular shape with an open, truss-like frame that exposes its internal machinery. A small, raised section is visible on the rear top of the submersible. It is equipped with three powerful lights that cast bright, white beams into the darkness: one at the front pointing forward and down, and two at the rear pointing backward and down, illuminating a rocky or metallic surface on the seafloor below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated underwater setting, a box-like submersible with a skeletal frame is stationary in dark, greenish-blue water. The vehicle, which has visible internal components, casts three bright, white beams of light forward and downward. These lights illuminate a muted blue-green seafloor with subtle gradients indicating depth and distance. Two lights from the rear of the submersible highlight a large, partially buried submarine-like ruin in the lower left corner, with no other rocks visible on the seafloor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
