    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man standing in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, with a round table in the foreground at the bottom center. The hands of a second person are visible in the bottom left foreground, resting near the table. An arc of fire originates from the center of the frame, near the standing man, and curves down toward the foreground table. As the camera, initially at the standing man's level, cranes upward, the shot transitions into a high-angle, bird's-eye view. During this movement, the standing man's head moves out of the top of the frame, while more of the seated person's body is revealed in the bottom left. The table remains in the center of the frame, now viewed from directly above, as the checkered floor becomes the primary background, and a ring of fire encircles the table in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin stands wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt featuring a multicolored design with yellow, red, blue, and green on the chest, along with light-colored baggy pants. He holds his hands up with his palms facing forward, and as the video progresses, his head moves out of the frame. Opposite him, another person is seated at a small, round table. Initially, only this person's hands are visible, positioned above the table. At the start of the video, an arc of fire is already present in front of the man's palms. As the camera cranes upward in an arc, the fire in front of his hands gradually diminishes, while the table becomes surrounded by a ring of fiery arcs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a room featuring a black and white checkered tile floor and light-colored, textured walls. A small, round table with a metallic top sits in the middle of the space, accompanied by several chairs, some of which are made of a translucent material with metal frames. In the middle ground, a person stands wearing a white shirt and light-colored pants. A bright orange stream of fire arcs through the air, directed toward the tabletop. As this occurs, the camera cranes upward, transitioning from a level angle to a bird's-eye view over the table. The entire scene is framed by a dark, soft-edged vignette overlay, which gives the video a grainy, vintage quality.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a man. As the camera cranes upward, his head moves out of the frame. The person opposite him—whose hands are initially the only part visible—gradually reveals most of their body by the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
