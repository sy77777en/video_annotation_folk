    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a woman on a horse is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, turning around a blue barrel. As they complete the turn, they move toward the left side of the frame, and a dog enters from the bottom left, running alongside them in the middle ground. The horse and rider then travel from the left to the right side of the frame, staying in the middle ground, while the camera pans to follow their movement. A dirt arena occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a fence and trees in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman wearing a brown helmet, a blue tank top, and dark pants rides a brown horse in a dirt arena. The horse has a dark mane and tail, white wraps on its front legs, and is fitted with a saddle over a pink saddle pad. As they straighten out after the horse makes a tight turn around a blue barrel, a dark-colored dog with white markings on its chest and legs runs into the scene and briefly follows them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor dirt arena on a sunny day, a person rides a brown horse around a blue barrel. The ground is composed of reddish-brown dirt, which is kicked up into a cloud as the horse moves. The arena is enclosed by a metal fence, and a line of green trees stands in the background under a clear sky. A small, dark dog with a white chest and legs briefly runs alongside the horse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
