    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the left midground, his back to the camera, while a woman is in the right midground, shown in profile facing left. Behind them, several rows of out-of-focus people occupy the background. A wooden pew is visible in the foreground, framing the bottom of the shot. The camera remains static at the subjects' eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a man and a woman seated in the midground, likely in a courtroom or formal assembly, with several other people visible in the blurred background. The man, positioned to the left and seen from the back, wears a dark suit jacket and has short, graying hair and a visible beard. To his right, the woman is shown in profile, facing towards the left side of the frame. She has fair skin, shoulder-length, straight brown hair, and is wearing a black top. Her expression is neutral and serious. Behind them, several rows of people are seated, though they are out of focus. The setting features wooden pews or benches.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a courtroom, characterized by rows of dark wooden pews with a warm, medium-brown finish. Light enters from windows with white blinds in the background, illuminating the space. Several people are seated in the pews, facing forward. The overall atmosphere is formal, with individuals dressed in dark, muted colors.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the same height as the subject's level.",
