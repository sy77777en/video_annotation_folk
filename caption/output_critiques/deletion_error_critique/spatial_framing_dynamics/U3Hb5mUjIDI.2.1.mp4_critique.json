    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a close-up on a man in the foreground on the right, whose hand is held up in a peace sign in the center-right foreground. In the middle ground, a line of people is positioned, stretching from the left to the center of the frame. A hilly landscape occupies the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The shot then transitions to a medium full shot, reframing the group of people from the middle ground to become the primary subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A shirtless man with brown skin, a full dark beard, and a braided necklace with a white shell pendant is in the foreground, holding up a peace sign with his right hand. Behind him stands a line of several men and women, also with brown skin, dressed in traditional-looking attire featuring skirts made of a straw-like material. The men in the middle ground are also shirtless. A woman near the center of the group has long dark hair and wears a top with a red, white, and black pattern. Between the foreground man and the line of women and men, another person is partially seen holding a pink smartphone, seemingly taking a picture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Outdoors, a group of people stand in a line against a backdrop of a vast, green, hilly landscape under a blue sky. The people are dressed in garments made of a brown, straw-like material. In the foreground, a man with a dark beard, wearing a woven, rope-like necklace with a white shell pendant, holds up a hand in a peace sign. He is positioned in front of the group, slightly to the right, with a person who is partially visible holding a smartphone between him and the line. The lighting is soft and even.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
