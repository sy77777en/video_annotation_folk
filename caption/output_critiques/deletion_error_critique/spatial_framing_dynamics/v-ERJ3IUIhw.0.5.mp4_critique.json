    "pre_caption": "A blue-lined circle, divided into segments, initially occupies the center foreground against a white background. Within this circle, a smaller concentric circle and a central flower-like pattern materialize, followed by additional concentric circles and smaller peripheral circles, all remaining in the center foreground. The entire circular design then shrinks and shifts slightly upwards in the center foreground, while lines extend downwards from its sides, forming the top edges of two rectangular structures that appear in the bottom left and bottom right foreground. Finally, the shrinking circular design resolves into a detailed circular window or logo at the top center of a building facade sketch, which now fills the center foreground, viewed from a low angle looking upwards.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a stylized, spiral shape resembling a shell or fan, drawn in blue lines. This shape gradually transforms into a circular wheel, from which a flower and concentric circles emerge outward. These elements connect to additional circles, eventually shrinking into a building logo. This seamless transition leads to a sketch of a building facade, characterized by a symmetrical design with multiple windows and a prominent circular feature at the top center, resembling a stained glass window or decorative element. The building is depicted with simple, clean lines, maintaining the blue color scheme, and the overall style is minimalist and architectural.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a minimalist, animated scene with a clean, white background. Initially, a dynamic, abstract form resembling a spiral or shell unfolds, characterized by smooth, flowing lines and a monochromatic blue hue. This shape suggests movement and transformation, with a sense of fluidity and elegance. As the scene progresses, the abstract form transforms into a circular pattern similar to a clock, gradually reducing in size to become a central feature of a stylized architectural structure. This building is depicted with simple, linear outlines and features a prominent circular window or clock at its center, adorned with intricate blue detailing, and is flanked by symmetrical rows of windows. The overall aesthetic is clean and geometric, emphasizing simplicity and symmetry in design.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
