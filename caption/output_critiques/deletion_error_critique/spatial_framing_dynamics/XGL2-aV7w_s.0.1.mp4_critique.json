    "pre_caption": "A full-body line drawing of a man from the back materializes in the center of the frame. This figure then fades and is replaced by a drawing of a chef, also positioned in the center. As the chef remains, a dragon's head appears at the bottom right, and its tail appears at the top right. Subsequently, all existing drawings disappear and are replaced by a single, large drawing of a complete, serpentine dragon. This dragon is coiled in a loop that dominates the center of the frame, with its head positioned in the top right and its tail extending towards the bottom right. All elements are presented against a static, textured background from a camera positioned at the subjects' height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black-and-white line drawing of a man is shown from the back, wearing loose pants and a headband in a dynamic pose. This figure is then depicted as a smiling chef with a tall hat and a jacket, holding a large bowl and a ladle. A long, serpentine creature, representative of a Chinese dragon, appears with a dragon-like head, horns, and a fish-like tail. Finally, a long, white, serpentine dragon is shown in full, coiled in a large loop. This dragon has a scaly body, a spiky ridge along its back, a flowing tail, and a detailed head with horns, whiskers, and a bridle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black-and-white line drawing animation set against a textured, parchment-like background, a figure is shown practicing Tai Chi. Following this, a chef with a tall hat is depicted using a spatula to stir-fry vegetables in a wok. A long, white, serpentine dragon with scales and a spined back then materializes. The dragon, which has a bridle around its head, unfurls its body into a large curve across the neutral space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
