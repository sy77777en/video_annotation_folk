    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a high-angle full shot, positioning a man in a yellow hoodie in the center-left middle ground and a woman lying on a rug in the center-right middle ground. A small television is visible in the top-center background. The camera then moves down and in, reframing the scene into a medium shot at the man's level. In this final composition, the man occupies the center-left of the frame, with the television now more prominent in the background behind him, while the woman is partially visible on the far right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin, wearing a yellow hoodie and dark pants, is seen from a high angle in a dimly lit setting. He is sitting or kneeling and brings a lit cigarette or joint to his mouth, with a gold-colored ring and bracelet visible on his hands. Next to him, a woman with dark hair, dressed in dark clothing, is sitting on a patterned rug. In the background, a small, old-fashioned television displays the head and shoulders of another person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, the scene is set within a dimly lit room. The floor is covered by a dark, patterned rug featuring red and yellow designs. An old, small CRT television is on, its screen glowing and displaying a continuous video. Scattered on the rug are a red circular ashtray, a disposable cup, and snack wrappers. The primary illumination comes from a single, focused light source from above, creating a bright spot in the otherwise dark space and casting deep shadows.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
