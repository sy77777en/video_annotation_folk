    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a parachutist landing in the center foreground on a large, circular platform. Their parachute billows above and behind them, occupying the upper center of the frame, with hills in the background. As the parachutist comes to a stop, the camera pans to the right, shifting the first subject to the left foreground. This pan reveals a large contraption in the center and right of the frame, and a second person standing in the top right, middle ground, on a raised wooden structure. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a white helmet lands on a large, circular grey platform with a red bullseye, their large white parachute featuring a red and yellow \"Red Bull\" logo billowing behind them. As the parachute deflates, the view pans to the right, revealing a smaller circular white platform with a red bullseye connected to a complex wooden and metal contraption. Standing on a wooden ramp that is part of this structure is a man in a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, holding a large wooden board, with a skateboard at his feet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on a vast, paved expanse under a bright blue sky dotted with white, puffy clouds. In the background, dry, rolling hills and a mountain range stretch across the horizon. A person with a large, white parachute emblazoned with the Red Bull logo lands on a circular, raised black platform marked with a grey ring and a red center. To the right of the landing platform stands an elaborate wooden and metal contraption, where another individual in a yellow shirt is positioned. A long, blue tarp fence is visible in the mid-ground, separating the main area from the grassy fields beyond.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
