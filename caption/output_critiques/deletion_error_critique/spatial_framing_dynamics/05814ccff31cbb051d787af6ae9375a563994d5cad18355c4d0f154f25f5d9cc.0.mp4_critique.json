    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of a textured wooden branch positioned diagonally across the frame, extending from the bottom left to the top right. The branch is in the foreground, with a rocky, sunlit background suggesting an outdoor setting. Initially, the scene focuses solely on the wood's texture. A long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings enters from the top left, moving across the branch towards the right. The insect's movement is captured at the same level as the wood, maintaining the camera's overhead perspective. The insect traverses the surface, highlighting the wood's intricate details before exiting the frame. The camera remains steady throughout, emphasizing the natural textures and the insect's path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a textured piece of wood as a long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings enters the frame and moves across the surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting featuring a close-up view of a textured, weathered branch elevated above a sandy or gravelly surface. The branch is light brown with visible grains and small patches of dust or sand. The environment suggests a natural, possibly arid location with muted earth tones. A notable visual element is an insect with long, slender legs and a body marked by contrasting black and orange colors, moving across the branch. The lighting indicates a bright, sunlit day, casting clear shadows and highlighting the textures of both the branch and the insect. The scene remains focused on the interaction between the branch and the insect, with the background softly blurred, emphasizing the natural details in the foreground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a full shot of an insect crawling on wood. Initially, only the wood is visible, then the bug enters from the top left, moves to the right, and eventually exits the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
