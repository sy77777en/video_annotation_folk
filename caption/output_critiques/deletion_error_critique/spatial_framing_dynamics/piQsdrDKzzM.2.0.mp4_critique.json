    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of the man, capturing him from the chest up. He is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the foreground, with his body facing slightly towards the right side of the frame. In the background, the dimly lit parking garage is visible, featuring concrete pillars and a partially visible car on the right. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a close-up, focusing more tightly on the man's face and upper shoulders. His position shifts slightly closer to the center of the frame, while the background elements become less prominent due to the tighter framing. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject throughout, keeping the man's face and upper body consistently in view. The transition from medium close-up to close-up smoothly narrows the field of vision, emphasizing the man's facial expressions and upper body movements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with short, dark hair and a medium skin tone. He is wearing a dark jacket and appears to be in a dimly lit environment. His expression is serious and contemplative. The man is positioned near a car, suggesting he might be interacting with it or preparing to leave. His posture is upright, and he seems to be focused on something outside the frame. The setting appears to be an indoor parking area, adding a sense of isolation to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in an indoor parking garage with a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere. The environment features concrete pillars and walls, with a muted color palette dominated by grays and browns. The lighting is low, casting soft shadows and creating a subdued ambiance. The garage is spacious, with visible structural elements like beams and support columns. A car is partially visible, adding to the utilitarian feel of the setting. The scene remains consistent in its industrial tone, with no significant changes in lighting or environment, maintaining a steady, observational perspective throughout.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
