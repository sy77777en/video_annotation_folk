    "pre_caption": "This low-angle full shot begins with a woman positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on a red surfboard that occupies the foreground. A large wave is visible in the middle ground on the right, while the sky and a distant landmass form the background. As the surfboard moves forward, the shot transitions into a low-angle close-up, focusing on the woman's legs and feet, which now fill the center of the frame in the foreground as water splashes around them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with tanned skin and long, light brown hair left loose is surfing on a wave. She is wearing a dark-colored bikini top and light-colored bikini bottoms. She stands with her knees bent and arms held out to her sides for balance on a red surfboard. The camera is positioned on the nose of the board, providing a low-angle view looking up at her. A black logo, resembling two stylized wings, is visible on the textured surface of the board near her bare feet as water splashes around her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on the front of a red surfboard captures a ride on the ocean under a bright blue sky. The board, which has a wet, textured surface and a black logo, glides across the water as a green-blue wave curls nearby. Water splashes up from the board's movement, partially obscuring the view. In the distance, a landmass is visible on the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
