    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a greenhouse interior, focusing on the spatial arrangement and growth of large, leafy green plants. Initially, the plants are positioned in the background on the right side of the frame, with their broad leaves extending outward. The foreground and middle ground are occupied by raised soil beds, lined with black irrigation hoses running parallel to the rows of plants. Wooden planks are placed intermittently across the soil, serving as walkways. As the video progresses, the plants grow and expand, gradually occupying more space in the frame, moving from the background towards the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective that highlights the orderly arrangement and dynamic growth within the greenhouse setting. The translucent greenhouse structure allows natural light to filter through, enhancing the visibility of the plants and the overall scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a greenhouse setting with a series of large, leafy green plants growing in rows. These plants have broad, vibrant green leaves and are arranged in a neat, organized pattern. The soil appears well-tended, with visible irrigation hoses running parallel to the rows of plants. The plants are positioned towards one end of the greenhouse, with some leaves sprawling outward, indicating healthy growth. The greenhouse structure includes a translucent covering, allowing natural light to filter through, enhancing the visibility of the plants' lush foliage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a greenhouse, characterized by a series of raised soil beds lined with black irrigation hoses. The environment is orderly, with wooden planks placed intermittently across the soil, likely serving as walkways. On one side, a row of large, leafy green plants adds a vibrant contrast to the earthy tones of the soil. The greenhouse structure is visible, with translucent plastic walls allowing diffused natural light to illuminate the space. Through time-lapse photography, the video captures the growth of the plants over several days or even months, all condensed into just a few seconds. The setting suggests a focus on cultivation, with the plants appearing healthy and well-maintained. The overall atmosphere is calm and organized, with the time-lapse effect highlighting the dynamic changes in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
