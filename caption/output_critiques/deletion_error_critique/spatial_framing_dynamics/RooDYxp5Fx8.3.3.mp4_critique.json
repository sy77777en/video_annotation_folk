    "pre_caption": "The camera moves forward along a clean, urban sidewalk in a Japanese city, capturing the environment and the flow of traffic. The scene includes modern mid-rise buildings, a green metal pedestrian overpass, trimmed bushes, and a small tree near a building entrance. The sidewalk is paved with gray and beige tiles, and there are blue road signs with white Japanese text and directional arrows above the street. The sky is clear and blue, and the traffic includes black and white vehicles, such as a van and a truck, moving along the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment characterized by modern buildings with clean lines and varied facades, a well-maintained sidewalk with tactile paving, and a busy street featuring vehicles such as a black van and a large white truck. The scene is bright and clear, with a blue sky and scattered clouds overhead, and signage in Japanese providing a sense of place. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city, emphasizing the interplay between architecture, infrastructure, and daily urban life rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a clean, urban sidewalk in a Japanese city during daytime. The environment is outdoors, with modern mid-rise buildings lining the street, their facades featuring glass, metal, and concrete surfaces in neutral tones. A green metal pedestrian overpass with visible rivets and a sloped ramp stands to the right, while trimmed bushes and a small tree add greenery near a building entrance. The sidewalk is paved with gray and beige tiles, some with tactile paving for accessibility. Blue road signs with white Japanese text and directional arrows are mounted above the street, and traffic flows steadily with black and white vehicles, including a van and a truck, visible at an intersection. The sky is clear and blue, and sunlight casts sharp shadows on the ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

At the start, the camera is positioned at a pedestrian’s eye level, moving forward along a sidewalk that occupies the bottom and lower center, extending into the background, with an intersection in the right-center middle ground. On the right, a green pedestrian overpass rises from the bottom right foreground, while modern buildings line the left and stretch from the foreground to the background. As the camera advances,  overpass gradually move out of view. A black van travels from left to right along the horizontal sidewalk, entering the middle ground at the center of the frame. Meanwhile, a large white truck moves along the right longitudinal road, transitioning from the middle ground to the background. Other vehicles are also moving in an orderly fashion.
