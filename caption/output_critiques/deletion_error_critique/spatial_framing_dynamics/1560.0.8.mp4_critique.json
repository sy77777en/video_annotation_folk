    "pre_caption": "This scenery video opens with an extreme wide shot. The Berlin Cathedral, a large stone edifice, is centrally positioned in the middle ground, extending from the bottom towards the top, with its main dome in the upper-center and a tower to its right. A scaffolding-covered tower is located in the left-center of the frame, also in the middle ground. Green treetops are visible in the foreground across the bottom edge. The bright blue sky with scattered white clouds occupies the background in the upper portion of the frame. The camera then moves quickly forward, causing the shot to transition into a wide shot. In this closer framing, the upper half of the cathedral fills the middle ground, its main dome remaining in the upper-center, while the tops of the foreground trees are still visible at the bottom. The sky and clouds continue to form the background. The camera maintains a low angle, looking upwards at the cathedral throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This cityscape scenery shot features a grand, historic building, likely a cathedral, with a large central dome and smaller towers, set against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. As the camera smoothly advances forward, a cyclist can be seen riding in the opposite direction, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The focus is on the architectural details and the overall impression of the structure within its urban context, emphasizing the environment, scale, and movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures the Berlin Cathedral, a grand, stone edifice with a prominent, green, copper-clad dome topped by a golden cross. Smaller towers with similar green domes flank the central structure, which is adorned with statues and intricate carvings. To the left of the cathedral, a tower is partially covered in blue scaffolding and tarps. At the beginning of the video, a cyclist and a grassy square are visible in the foreground and midground. As the camera quickly moves forward, the frame narrows to show only the tops of some green trees in the foreground and the upper half of the cathedral in the midground. The scene is set against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery initially, and then changing to a wide shot.",
