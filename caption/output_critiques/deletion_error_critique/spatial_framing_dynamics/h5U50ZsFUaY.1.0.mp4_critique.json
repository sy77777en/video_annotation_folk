    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, framing a person in a wingsuit in the top left of the frame from a low angle. A large, reddish-brown rock formation dominates the foreground on the right, set against a sky background. The camera then rotates counter-clockwise while tilting down, transitioning to an extreme wide shot. This movement repositions the person, who has now deployed a parachute, to the center-left of the frame and at the camera's level. The vast canyon now occupies the foreground and middle ground at the bottom and left, with the rock formation remaining on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is shown wingsuit flying, wearing a blue and black suit, dark blue pants, and a helmet. They are seen in a freefall position with their arms and legs spread out. Later, this person deploys a parachute that is bright yellow-green.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set against a deep blue sky with wispy white clouds, the scene unfolds in a vast, arid canyon. The landscape is dominated by towering, reddish-brown rock formations with rugged, layered textures. During the daytime, a person in a blue and black wingsuit is seen in freefall near a prominent rock spire. The perspective shifts, revealing the expansive desert terrain below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
