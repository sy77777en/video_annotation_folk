    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of the urban landscape, capturing the full expanse of the Queensboro Bridge and its surroundings. The bridge dominates the center of the frame, extending diagonally from the bottom left towards the upper right. Its intricate steel framework and beige color are prominent in the foreground and middle ground. The bridge's towers stand tall, with cables stretching upwards and outwards, supported by large pylons positioned on either side of the river. \n\nOn the left side of the frame, a modern glass building occupies the foreground, partially reflecting the surrounding cityscape. To the right, various buildings of different heights fill the middle ground and background, creating a dense urban environment. The East River flows beneath the bridge, occupying the lower portion of the frame, with its surface reflecting the overcast sky. \n\nTraffic moves steadily along the bridge, visible in the middle ground, while cable car lines run parallel to the bridge, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned above the bridge and buildings, providing a sweeping aerial view of the entire urban setting. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the video, maintaining a steady and expansive perspective of the cityscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, showcasing the bridge, buildings, and skyline. The emphasis is on the scale and atmosphere of the city rather than a specific object, highlighting the architectural elements and the expanse of the cityscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an urban setting featuring the Queensboro Bridge in New York City. The scene unfolds during the day, under an overcast sky, casting a muted light over the cityscape. The bridge, with its intricate steel framework and beige color, spans across the East River, connecting Manhattan and Queens. Surrounding the bridge are tall buildings, both modern and older structures, creating a dense city environment. The river below reflects the gray sky, adding to the urban atmosphere. Traffic moves steadily along the bridge, while the adjacent cable car lines add a dynamic element to the scene. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the bridge and the city, emphasizing the architectural and infrastructural elements of this iconic location.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
