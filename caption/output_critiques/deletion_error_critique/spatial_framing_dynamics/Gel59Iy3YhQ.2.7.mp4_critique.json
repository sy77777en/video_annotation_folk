    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on the environment. The scene begins from a first-person perspective inside a dark cave, with the rocky entrance in the foreground framing the view of a river valley in the middle ground. The camera then moves forward, exiting the cave and proceeding along a path. As it emerges, the cave walls recede from the frame, and the foreground becomes occupied by the path and grassy riverbank at the bottom of the screen. The river flows from the background through the center of the frame, flanked by reddish-brown rock formations and pine trees in the middle ground and background on both the left and right. The camera maintains a low height throughout the forward movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a landscape scenery shot of a stylized wilderness. The perspective emerges from a dark, rocky cave to reveal a tranquil valley. A gentle river, shrouded in a low-lying mist, flows between grassy banks and reddish-brown rock formations. The scene is bordered by a forest of tall, green pine trees under a soft, cloudy sky, all rendered in a warm, painterly art style. There is no main subject, as the focus is on immersing the viewer in the serene atmosphere and the beauty of the natural environment itself, creating a sense of discovery.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, emerges from a dark, rocky cave into a stylized Wyoming wilderness. The scene opens onto a valley where a gentle river, shrouded in low-lying mist, flows between grassy banks. The valley is enclosed by reddish-brown, low-poly rock formations and hills dotted with green evergreen trees. A warm light illuminates the landscape under a muted teal sky with stylized clouds, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The perspective moves in a nearly straight line, emerging from the cave and progressing directly from the land towards the river, revealing more of the tranquil, misty scenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
