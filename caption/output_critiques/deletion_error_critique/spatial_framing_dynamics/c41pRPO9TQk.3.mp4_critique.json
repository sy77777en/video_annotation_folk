    "pre_caption": "This wide shot shows a man in the center-left of the middle ground, holding a white bag and wading slightly towards the center through floodwater that covers the foreground and middle ground. A child is seated on a makeshift raft in the center of the middle ground, with an orange, white, and green basket to their left. In the center-right of the middle ground, a woman stands in the doorway of a house which occupies the background across the frame. Green foliage is visible on the far right in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A shirtless man with dark skin, wearing light green lower garments, stands in murky floodwater, holding a large white bag. Near him, a small child with dark skin and dark hair, wearing a light purple dress, sits on a makeshift flotation device in the water, next to an orange, white, and green basket. In the doorway of a house with a patterned tiled facade, a woman with dark skin, wearing a dark red or maroon saree, observes the outside, looking at the water. The lower portion of the house is submerged in the brown floodwater.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds outdoors during the daytime, in a flooded area directly in front of a house. Murky brown water covers the ground, reaching the lower portion of the building. The house features a facade decorated with rectangular tiles in shades of brown and beige, arranged in a brick-like pattern, and has a covered porch with a curved archway. A wooden door and window are visible. Sunlight casts shadows, indicating clear weather. A man wades through the water carrying a white bag. Near the doorway, a woman stands, and a child sits on a bundle of items, including a colorful fabric, placed on wooden planks or bamboo acting as a makeshift raft. An orange plastic bucket with accents of white and green floats in the water, and some green foliage is visible to the side.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
