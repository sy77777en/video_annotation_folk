    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, the main skateboarder positioned in the foreground, slightly right of center, on a curved light grey ledge that spans the bottom of the frame. To his left and in the center middle ground, a large dark grey stone monument with bronze statues and white graffiti is prominent, with a round brown brick tower and a European-style building visible behind it in the background. Another man walks in the far right middle ground, and a trash can is to the right of center in the middle ground. The skateboarder moves left along the foreground ledge, performing a trick near the center-left. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the skateboarder continues moving left and then away from the camera, transitioning from the foreground ledge to a cobblestone pavement in the middle ground and eventually the background. As he moves into the background, performing another trick in the center of the frame, the surrounding urban plaza becomes more expansive, revealing multi-story European-style buildings framing the left, center, and right background, along with pedestrians, green trees, an orange tram moving from left to center in the background, and a street lamp to the left of center in the background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person skateboarding in an urban setting. The skateboarder, wearing a pink long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and white shoes, is captured performing tricks near a statue and later on a cobblestone area. The individual appears to be male, with short hair, and is actively engaged in skateboarding maneuvers. In the background, there are other people walking, and a tram is visible, indicating a bustling city environment. The skateboarder is the central focus, showcasing skill and movement throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, an objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective, is filmed with a fisheye lens creating a distorted, wide-angle view of an outdoor urban plaza during daytime under a cloudy sky. A large, dark grey stone monument adorned with bronze statues and bearing white graffiti, including the word \"TORIGANG,\" on its base stands prominently, with a castle-like stone building featuring twin cylindrical towers visible behind it. The plaza features smooth, light grey concrete surfaces, including a curved ledge in the foreground, which transitions to a cobblestone pavement. Multi-story European-style buildings with numerous windows frame the background, where green trees, pedestrians, and an orange tram are also present. A skateboarder is seen moving across these varied surfaces within the plaza.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
