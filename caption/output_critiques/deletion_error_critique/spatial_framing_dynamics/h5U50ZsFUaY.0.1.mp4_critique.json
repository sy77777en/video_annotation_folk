    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, positioning a person in the center-middle ground on the edge of a rocky precipice. In the background, a vast mountain range stretches across the frame, with the sun positioned in the top left. The camera, initially at the subject's level, abruptly tilts downwards as the person jumps, transitioning to an extreme wide shot from a high angle. The camera is now positioned above the subject, who descends toward the bottom of the frame against the sheer rock face that fills the scene, with a scree-filled valley visible below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a red long-sleeved top, black pants, and a black helmet is shown standing on the edge of a rocky precipice. They are equipped with a blue and black wingsuit and a parachute pack. The individual leaps from the cliff, initiating a BASE jump. As they descend, the blue panels on the back and arms of their wingsuit become prominent.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, rugged mountain range under a clear blue sky. The bright sun hangs low, casting a hazy light over distant peaks and creating long shadows across the steep, rocky terrain. The camera, initially focused on a person standing on a sharp, craggy cliff edge, tilts sharply downwards to follow the sheer, textured rock face into a deep, scree-filled valley below.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
