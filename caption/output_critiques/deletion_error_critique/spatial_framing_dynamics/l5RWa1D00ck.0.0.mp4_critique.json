    "pre_caption": "The video is a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. A woman stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, facing away from the camera. Directly behind her, also in the center middle ground, a bus with its headlights on illuminates her back. To the left of this central bus, another bus is positioned in the middle ground, and a third bus is similarly positioned to the right of the central bus in the middle ground. A cobblestone surface occupies the foreground and extends into the middle ground beneath the woman and buses. In the background, a building is visible across the top of the frame. Towards the end of the clip, the woman in the center slightly raises her arms outwards to her sides.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a light-colored, mid-calf length dress, stands on a cobblestone surface during the night. She is positioned facing away from the camera, looking towards a group of parked, older-model buses that appear light-colored under the dim, blue-toned lighting. The bus directly in front of her has its headlights on, illuminating her back and the ground near her feet. Towards the end of the brief clip, she slightly raises her arms outwards to her sides.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in the early morning or at dusk on a cobblestone street or plaza, where several vintage, light-colored buses are parked. A building with visible windows stands in the background. The overall ambiance is dim, with a blue tint, and the headlights of the central bus are illuminated, casting light forward. A person in a light-colored dress stands facing away from the camera, positioned in front of the illuminated bus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
