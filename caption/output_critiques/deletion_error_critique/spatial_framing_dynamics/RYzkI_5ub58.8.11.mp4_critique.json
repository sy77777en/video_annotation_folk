    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a vast underwater scene where a large school of small, silvery fish is distributed throughout the entire frame, occupying the foreground, middle ground, and background to create significant depth. These small fish are seen swimming generally from the right side of the frame towards the left. Positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground is a single, larger, dark-colored fish, which remains relatively stationary. The camera is positioned at approximately the same height as the fish.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an underwater scene, a large school of small, silvery, elongated fish fills the entire sea area, swimming generally from right to left. Positioned in the center of the picture, behind the school, is a single, larger, dark gray fish with a deep, rounded body and prominent fins.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An underwater scene unfolds in the vast, blue expanse of the open ocean. A single, large, dark-colored fish is positioned in the middle of the frame, surrounded by a massive school of smaller, silvery fish. The countless small fish swim predominantly from the right side of the frame to the left, filling the water around the larger creature. The water itself transitions from a bright, light blue at the top, where sunlight filters through, to a deeper, darker blue in the depths below.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
