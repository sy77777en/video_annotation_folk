    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot of a rural landscape is captured from a very low camera angle, focusing on the ground in the immediate foreground which occupies the bottom half of the frame. In the blurred middle ground, a dark building sits on the left, a utility pole is positioned left of center, and a metal shed is located near the center. To the right in the middle ground stands a large tree. Further in the background, a water tower is visible behind the tree on the right, with distant structures and hills stretching across the horizon under the sky in the upper portion of the frame. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A scenic landscape shot highlighting the environment and atmosphere, featuring buildings, trees, and sky to convey the scale and ambiance of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting at dusk, featuring a quiet, rural landscape. The scene includes a small, weathered building with a sloped roof, constructed from dark, textured material. Nearby, a simple metal structure, possibly a shed, stands with a corrugated surface. A prominent tower at the center of the frame but slightly towards the right rises against the dimming sky, adding to the rustic atmosphere. The ground is covered with scattered debris, suggesting a neglected area. A single utility pole stands without wires, contributing to the rural ambiance. The sky transitions from a pale gray to a desaturated orange near the horizon, indicating either sunset or sunrise. A small white text overlay, marked [10], is located in the bottom left corner without obstructing the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
