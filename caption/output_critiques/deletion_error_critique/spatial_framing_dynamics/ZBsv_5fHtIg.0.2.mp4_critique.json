    "pre_caption": "In this static wide shot, a black car is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera placed at the car's level. A paved surface extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame towards the vehicle. In the background, a large cable-stayed bridge is framed centrally behind the car. A multi-story building occupies the right side of the frame in the background, while a portion of another building is visible on the far left in the middle ground. Dark foliage is situated on both the left and right sides of the car, also in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-colored, possibly black, BMW car is positioned centrally, facing directly towards the viewer. The car's daytime running lights are illuminated, displaying a distinctive circular pattern. The vehicle has a wide, low-slung appearance, characteristic of a sports model.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an urban setting at dusk, a black sedan is parked on a paved surface, facing the camera. The car's distinctively shaped white daytime running lights are on, contrasting with its dark body, which is mostly in shadow. In the background, the silhouette of a large, modern cable-stayed bridge with tall, angled pylons and numerous cables is visible against a bright, pale sky. A multi-story building stands on the right, and dark foliage is present on both sides of the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
