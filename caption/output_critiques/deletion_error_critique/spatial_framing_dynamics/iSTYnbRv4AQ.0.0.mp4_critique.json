    "pre_caption": "This wide shot moves rapidly forward down the center of a street, creating a strong radial motion blur that emanates from the background. In the bottom right foreground, a red car is blurred by the fast motion. A green scooter is positioned in the left middle ground, parked on the pavement. The scene is framed by tall buildings on the left and right sides, which recede from the middle ground to the background. A central pedestrian walkway acts as a vanishing point, where small figures of people are visible walking in the distant background. The camera is positioned at a low height relative to the street but is above the distant subjects it moves towards.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red car, appearing stationary and facing left, is in the foreground. A small figure wearing a red top moves from the foreground into the midground as she increases her speed. On the left side of the street, a bright green, stand-up electric scooter is parked on the pavement. In the distance, down the center of the wide street, the small, indistinct figures of several people can be seen walking.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A fast-moving perspective down a wide European avenue at sunrise or sunset is characterized by a strong radial motion blur due to the camera's movement. The street is lined on both sides by tall, classical multi-story buildings with uniform, sandy-colored facades. In the foreground, a red car appears blurred from the camera's motion, and a light green scooter is parked on the left. A small figure in a red top is in the foreground, moving into the midground as she increases her speed. The central pedestrian walkway is flanked by bare trees, and a few distant figures walk towards the horizon, where the sky glows with orange and pink hues.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A wide shot of a street follows a person walking forward, keeping their full body in frame while leaving ample context for the surrounding scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
