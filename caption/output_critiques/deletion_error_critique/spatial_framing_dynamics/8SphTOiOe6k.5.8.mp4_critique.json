    "pre_caption": "This wide, eye-level shot initially frames two men in suits in the center middle ground, standing between a glass food display case on the left and a red vending machine on the right, with an orange bicycle positioned in the bottom-left middle ground. A man in the right foreground walks toward the left, passing the camera. The two men in suits then walk out of the frame to the right. Subsequently, other pedestrians, including a man in a black shirt and a woman with light brown hair, enter from the right and walk across the middle ground toward the left, passing in front of the stationary vending machines and bicycle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Several pedestrians, all wearing face masks, are observed. Two men in dark blue suits and white shirts are initially seen from the back, standing by a tall red beverage vending machine before walking away. A man in a dark grey long-sleeve shirt walks by holding a cellphone. A man in a black long-sleeved shirt with a pink design on the back walks past. Another man, wearing a white t-shirt, also walks by. A woman with long, wavy, light brown hair and a white collared shirt is seen walking past, mostly from her side and back, accompanied by another woman with long, wavy, lighter brown hair and a light brown jacket. Stationary objects in the scene include an orange bicycle with a brown seat and a front basket, a glass-fronted display case with food models, the red beverage vending machine, and a smaller, dark-colored vending machine displaying rows of small, colorful items.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a daytime street in Japan, featuring a storefront with a wooden facade and a large glass display case. Inside the case, numerous realistic models of Japanese food, such as ramen and donburi bowls, are arranged on illuminated shelves. Adjacent to the shop stands a bright red Coca-Cola vending machine filled with various soft drinks. Between the storefront and the vending machines, an orange bicycle with a brown seat and a front basket is parked, alongside a smaller black stand displaying a grid of colorful items with Japanese text related to blood types and an Egyptian pharaoh graphic. Pedestrians, including some in dark uniforms and others in casual clothes, walk through the scene, all wearing face masks.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
