    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot captures a street scene from an eye-level perspective across the road. A pale yellow, two-story building occupies the middle ground, spanning the full width of the frame. In the foreground, the front of a dark car is visible in the bottom left, while the rear of a white car is in the bottom right, framing the view. A black lamppost stands in the middle ground on the right. The primary movement within the scene is a person in dark clothing walking a black dog from left to right along the sidewalk in front of the building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a quiet street in a historic district, characterized by its distinctive architecture. A two-story building with a pale yellow facade, arched doorways, and windows framed by light green wooden shutters occupies the center of the frame, with a black wrought-iron balcony running along the upper level. A classic black lamppost stands on the sidewalk next to an arched entryway. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on capturing the architectural charm and atmosphere of the location. A person in a dark jacket walking a black dog from right to left is a transient element that adds a sense of life to the environment rather than being the central focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A person in dark clothing walks a black dog from left to right along a sidewalk in front of a two-story building with a pale yellow facade. The building features arched doorways and windows, several of which are flanked by open, light-green wooden shutters. A black iron railing is visible on the second-story balcony. A vintage-style black lamppost stands on the sidewalk near an arched entryway. The scene is viewed from across a paved street, with portions of parked cars visible in the foreground on both the right and left sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
