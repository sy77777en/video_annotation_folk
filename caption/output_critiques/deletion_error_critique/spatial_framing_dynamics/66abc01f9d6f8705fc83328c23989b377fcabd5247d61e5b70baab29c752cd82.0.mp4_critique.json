    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with the camera at his level. In the foreground, several sticky notes are adhered to a transparent surface: \"OUR NET-WORTH\" is at the bottom left, \"Dead Line\" is to its right, an up/down arrow symbol is near the center, and a line graph is to the right of the arrow. The man, initially counting money, takes a yellow sticky note inscribed with \"1000\" from his hands in the middle ground and moves it forward, placing it onto the transparent surface in the foreground, slightly above and to the left of the arrow symbol. The office environment, featuring desks, chairs, and plants, occupies the background throughout the shot. The shot size and camera position relative to the man remain constant.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man of East Asian appearance, with short black hair, wearing round glasses, a beige polo shirt, and dark pleated pants, is observed in an office setting. He holds a fan of US dollar bills in both hands, appearing to count them, while his left hand fingers are clipping two small yellow sticky notes. He uses his right hand to take a yellow sticky note from his left hand, on which \"1000\" is written, and carefully places it onto a transparent surface directly in front of him. Several other sticky notes are already adhered to this surface, including one inscribed with \"OUR NET-WORTH,\" another with \"Dead Line,\" one featuring an upward and downward arrow symbol, and one displaying a simple upward-trending line graph.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A man in a beige polo shirt and dark pants stands behind a transparent surface, counting money and placing a yellow sticky note with \"1000\" written on it. The video is set in a brightly lit, modern office environment during the day, featuring an open-plan layout with wooden desks, black office chairs, and numerous potted plants of various sizes, contributing to a green and lively atmosphere. Overhead, fluorescent light panels and exposed ventilation pipes are visible. In the foreground, several colorful sticky notes are adhered to the transparent surface, displaying simple drawings like an upward-trending graph and arrows.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
