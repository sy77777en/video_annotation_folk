    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a top-down aerial perspective, a white semi-trailer truck is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The truck is on a paved road that runs diagonally from the top left to the bottom right of the scene. The camera tracks the truck, keeping it centered, as the surrounding desert landscape in the background scrolls from the top right towards the bottom left. The scene is viewed through a graphic overlay of several crosshairs distributed across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a top-down aerial perspective with an overlaid crosshair graphic, a white semi-trailer truck is stationary on a four-lane paved road. The truck, consisting of a cab and a long, rectangular trailer, is positioned in the center of the frame. The road, marked with a double yellow center line and white dashed lane lines, cuts through a vast, sandy, and arid landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a top-down view of a white semi-trailer truck that appears stationary on a paved highway cutting diagonally across a vast, arid desert. The landscape is a light brown, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation. The dark asphalt road features white dashed lane markings and a double yellow line in the center. The footage has a grainy, sepia-toned filter, and the scene is overlaid with several light-colored crosshair markings, resembling a surveillance or targeting display.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
