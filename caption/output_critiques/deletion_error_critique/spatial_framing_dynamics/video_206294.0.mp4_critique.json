    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, shows a herd of horses in the middle ground, initially positioned in the bottom left of the frame. They run as a group across a vast, snow-covered plain that fills the lower and central areas of the scene. In the background, a range of large, snow-covered mountains extends across the upper portion of the frame. The herd moves diagonally from the bottom left toward the center-right, remaining consistently in the middle ground as the camera tracks their movement across the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A herd of approximately a dozen horses runs together. The horses display a variety of coat colors, including several shades of brown from light tan and chestnut to dark brown, along with at least one grey or white horse. They are all in a running posture, moving as a cohesive group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a herd of horses galloping across a vast, snow-covered plain during the daytime. The expansive landscape is blanketed in white snow, with a range of large, rugged mountains, also covered in snow, visible in the background under a bright, hazy sky. The horses, varying in shades of brown and black, move as a group across the open terrain, kicking up powdery snow as they run.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
