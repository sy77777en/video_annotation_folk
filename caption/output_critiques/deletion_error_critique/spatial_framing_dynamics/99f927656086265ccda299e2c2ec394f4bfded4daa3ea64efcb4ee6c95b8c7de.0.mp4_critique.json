    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, two people pulling a small sled are positioned in the middle ground, initially located slightly left of the frame's center. A snow-covered expanse fills the foreground and middle ground, with a dense forest line in the background and an overcast sky occupying the top of the frame. The two individuals walk at a steady pace from left to right across the middle ground, remaining relatively small within the vast landscape. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two people walk across a flat, snow-covered surface. The person on the right of the frame wears a bright yellow jacket, dark pants, and a green hat. The person on the left of the frame, walking slightly behind, is dressed in a brown jacket, dark pants, and a red hat. Together, they pull a small, dark, rectangular sled that follows them on the snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a smooth, sweeping perspective, a vast, snow-covered frozen lake unfolds under a pale, overcast sky. The distant shoreline is defined by a dense forest of dark pine and bare deciduous trees. Two figures, one wearing a yellow jacket, move across the expansive ice, pulling a small, dark sled. The ground is uniformly white with snow, marked only by faint tracks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
