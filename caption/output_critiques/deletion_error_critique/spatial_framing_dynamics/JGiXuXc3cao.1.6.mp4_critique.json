    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of an animated man, Robert Ballard, positioned in the right foreground against a background of the ocean and sky. The shot then transitions to a medium shot, pulling back slightly to reveal more of his torso. As this happens, white text appears in the upper-left middle ground, identifying the subject. The camera is positioned at the subject's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated illustration depicts a white man, identified by on-screen text as \"ROBERT BALLARD\" and \"MARINE GEOLOGIST.\" He has short, light-colored hair and is smiling, looking forward. He wears a blue, short-sleeved collared shirt with his arms crossed over his chest. The shirt has two patches: a circular one on the right chest with a red and blue design featuring a ship, and another on the left chest with a blue design on a white background. He also wears a blue baseball cap with a white logo of a mountain, and a watch with a black band is visible on his right wrist.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An animated scene is set against the backdrop of a vast, calm, blue-green ocean stretching to the horizon under a light blue sky with soft, white clouds. The water appears still, with visible static waves. White text overlays appear in the upper-left portion of the scene, identifying the subject as \"ROBERT BALLARD\" and \"MARINE GEOLOGIST.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.",
