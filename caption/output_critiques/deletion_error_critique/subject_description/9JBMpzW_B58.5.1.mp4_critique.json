    "pre_caption": "This video presents a maritime scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship. The perspective looks forward over stacks of red, blue, white, and green shipping containers that create a geometric foreground, leading the eye out to a vast, smooth-surfaced ocean stretching to the horizon. The sky undergoes a dramatic transformation, shifting from the soft, pastel pinks and purples of a dusky sunset to a turbulent, overcast grey with fast-moving clouds. The focus of the video is not on a particular subject but rather on the immense scale of the natural environment and the atmospheric changes over time. The ship serves as a static vantage point, emphasizing the vastness of the sea and the dynamic sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
