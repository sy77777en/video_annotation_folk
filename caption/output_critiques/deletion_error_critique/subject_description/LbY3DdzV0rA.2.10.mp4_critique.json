    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a vast canyon at sunset. The expansive canyon, with its layered rock formations, is cast mostly in deep shadow, while a thin, winding river is visible at its bottom. Above, the sky is a dynamic canvas of dark, heavy storm clouds and lighter, puffy clouds against a backdrop of blue. The setting sun, positioned on the left, emits a brilliant golden glow, sending sweeping sunbeams through gaps in the clouds that illuminate the hazy atmosphere and parts of the distant landscape. In the distance, curtains of rain can be seen falling from the base of the darker clouds. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to capture the immense scale of the natural environment and the awe-inspiring atmospheric spectacle of the changing light and weather.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
