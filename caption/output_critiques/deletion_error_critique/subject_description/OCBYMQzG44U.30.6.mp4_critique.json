    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a disorienting, low-angle view looking up a vast, tiled wall. The wall, made of small, pale green tiles, is dotted with numerous identical, small rectangular windows that are brightly illuminated from within. A long, intensely bright light fixture runs along the top of the frame, casting a sterile, hazy glow over the scene and creating a sense of immense height. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the overwhelming scale and repetitive, minimalist pattern of the environment, which evokes a sterile and surreal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
