    "pre_caption": "This video presents an industrial scenery shot of a unique, custom-built environment. The focus is on the impressive scale and creative design of the setting itself, rather than on a particular subject, showcasing a long stationary train transformed into a skatepark. The train consists of blue shipping containers, branded with Red Bull and Prada logos, sitting on tracks in a railyard next to another freight train with brown tanker cars. The tops of the blue containers are fitted with a continuous, light-tan-colored ramp system, featuring a step-up ramp leading to a higher section, followed by a step-down. A red animated arrow traces a potential path over these ramps. The scene is set on a clear, sunny day, with green trees and distant hills visible in the background, while a person in an orange safety vest stands on the ground beside the train.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
