The station is characterized by its expansive glass and steel structures, casting intricate shadows on the platform. A high-speed train, with a streamlined design and blue accents, is prominently visible, emphasizing the station's role as a hub of transportation. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the blend of modern engineering and urban life rather than a specific object or person. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the train and the station, illustrating the scale and functionality of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
