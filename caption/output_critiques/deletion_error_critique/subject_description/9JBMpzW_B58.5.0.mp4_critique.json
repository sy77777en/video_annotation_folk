    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic time-lapse seascape captured at night from the bow of a large container ship. The composition emphasizes the immense scale of the environment, making the atmosphere the primary focus rather than a specific subject. The foreground is occupied by rows of shipping containers, leading the eye out towards the vast, dark ocean that meets a star-filled sky. Dark clouds drift rapidly across the celestial expanse, which is illuminated by a bright yellow glow on the distant horizon and a subtle green airglow, creating a breathtaking and dynamic nocturnal scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
