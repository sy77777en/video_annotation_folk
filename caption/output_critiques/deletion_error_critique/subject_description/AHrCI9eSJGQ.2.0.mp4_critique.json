    "pre_caption": "This video presents a breathtaking maritime scenery shot captured from the bow of a massive container ship on the open ocean at night. Above, a spectacular, star-studded sky, featuring the dense band of the Milky Way, is partially obscured by low, dark clouds. A distant thunderstorm flashes intermittently, illuminating the cloud formations from within and casting a faint glow on the horizon. The shot lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the awe-inspiring juxtaposition of the serene, star-filled cosmos and the dynamic, stormy weather over the vast, dark sea. The ship itself serves primarily as a vantage point, with the tops of its containers in the foreground guiding the viewer's gaze into the epic scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
