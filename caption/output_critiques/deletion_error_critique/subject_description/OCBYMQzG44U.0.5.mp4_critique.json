    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot that transitions from an enclosed space to an open one. The focus is on the environment and the unsettling atmosphere it creates, rather than on a specific subject, an effect heightened by the first-person perspective. The sequence begins inside a dark, reddish-brown, enclosed water slide tube, looking toward a small circle of light. It then emerges from the slide's red-rimmed exit into a starkly lit, institutional-looking pool room. The room features white tiled walls, a pool of murky greenish water, and a simple metal railing along a set of stairs in the background, all contributing to a sense of eerie emptiness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
