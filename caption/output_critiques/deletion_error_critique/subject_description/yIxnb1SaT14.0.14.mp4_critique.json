    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide-angle cityscape scenery shot of a grand, semicircular courtyard at night. There is no single main subject, as the slow, pulling-back camera movement is designed to capture the impressive scale and atmosphere of the entire architectural space. The scene is dominated by a large, multi-story building with a curved facade, brilliantly illuminated by warm, yellow lights that highlight its classical details, numerous windows, and balconies. In the center of the cobblestone square stands a dark, bronze equestrian statue on a stone plinth. To the right, a prominent red neon sign for the \"THEATRE EDOUARD VII\" glows above an entrance flanked by red umbrellas and outdoor seating, while the ground-floor colonnade is lit with a cooler, greenish-white light, creating a striking visual contrast.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
