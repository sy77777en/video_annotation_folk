The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the contrast between the deep green-blue of the ocean and the dark, wet sand. The white foam of the waves creates a dynamic line that emphasizes the movement and energy of the sea. The absence of a specific subject allows the viewer to appreciate the vastness and tranquility of the coastal scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
