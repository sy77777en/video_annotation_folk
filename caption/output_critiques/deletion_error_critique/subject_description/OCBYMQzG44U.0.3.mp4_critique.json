    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor recreational scenery shot, depicting a pool area with large, brightly colored waterslides. A prominent red waterslide curves downwards towards a pool of water, partially obscured by a metal railing in the foreground. Behind it, a green waterslide is also visible. The surrounding area features white tiled walls and what appears to be a tiled platform or walkway with a grid pattern. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay of these elements, rather than a specific object, highlighting the atmosphere and design of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
