    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling canal in Venice, Italy. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the historic city rather than a specific main subject, capturing the scale and unique character of the location. The murky green water of the Grand Canal is filled with activity, featuring a white and yellow vaporetto (water bus) moving through the center, alongside several traditional black gondolas, some being rowed and others docked. Lining the canal are rows of classic Venetian buildings, characterized by their aged, multi-story facades in shades of tan, yellow, and off-white, topped with reddish-brown tiled roofs, creating a dense and picturesque architectural landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
