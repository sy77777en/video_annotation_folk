    "pre_caption": "This is a forest scenery shot depicting a paved, two-lane road curving through a dense redwood forest. Massive, ancient redwood trees with thick, dark trunks tower over the scene, their immense scale creating a cathedral-like atmosphere as sunlight filters through the high canopy, casting bright patches and deep shadows across the road and the lush green undergrowth. A dark-colored sedan drives along the road, its presence highlighting the vastness of the surrounding trees. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the majestic and immersive atmosphere of the ancient forest. The composition emphasizes the scale of the natural environment rather than any specific object within it. The car acts as a point of reference, underscoring the grandeur of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
