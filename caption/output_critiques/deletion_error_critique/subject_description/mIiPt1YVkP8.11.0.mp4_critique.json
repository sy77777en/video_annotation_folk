    "pre_caption": "This video presents a stylized scenery shot of a vast, empty airport at either sunrise or sunset. The camera looks down a long, straight runway that stretches into the hazy distance, while a curving taxiway with yellow centerlines merges into it from the foreground. The surrounding flat, green terrain is marked by a grid-like pattern of other taxiways and simple, blocky buildings that form a minimalist cityscape on the horizon under a thick, reddish-purple haze, with a bright, glowing sun hanging low in the sky. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the expansive scale of the airport and the atmospheric, almost surreal, quality of the light and fog, creating a sense of quiet desolation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
