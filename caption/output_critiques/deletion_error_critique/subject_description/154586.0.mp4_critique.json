    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot of a serene winter forest. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the tranquil atmosphere and the beauty of nature. Snow blankets the ground and clings to the branches of tall, leafless trees, creating a uniform white landscape. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft, dappled shadows and adding a warm glow to the otherwise cool scene. The absence of a specific subject emphasizes the vastness and peacefulness of the forest, inviting viewers to appreciate the overall ambiance and scale of the natural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
