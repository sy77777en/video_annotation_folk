    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris at night. The monument, with its intricate carvings and a bronze quadriga sculpture on top, is brightly illuminated against the dark sky, where clouds drift by. The surrounding plaza is dotted with streetlights that create a starburst effect, and the blurred motion of people walking around the base of the arch indicates a time-lapse or long-exposure technique. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the grand atmosphere and architectural scale of the iconic landmark. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of a bustling yet timeless Parisian night, rather than on any individual person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
