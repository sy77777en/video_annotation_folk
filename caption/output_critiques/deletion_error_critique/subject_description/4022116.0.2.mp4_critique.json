    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot capturing the iconic Grand Canal in Venice on an overcast day. The camera glides across the choppy, green water, revealing a panorama of historic, multi-story buildings with terracotta roofs lining the canal banks. Various boats populate the scene, including a white and green vaporetto (water bus) labeled \"Actv 26\" carrying passengers, and a smaller wooden motorboat navigating the waterway. The view also includes a grand, ornate white church with wide stone steps leading down to a dock where other water buses are moored. There is no single main subject, as the shot is designed to immerse the viewer in the unique atmosphere and architectural scale of the Venetian environment, emphasizing the city's reliance on its canals.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
