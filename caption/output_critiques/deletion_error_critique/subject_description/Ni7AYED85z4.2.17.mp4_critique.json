    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot featuring a misty waterfront with historic buildings lining the opposite shore, their facades partially obscured by fog. The water in the foreground is a deep blue-green, gently rippling and bordered by a stone walkway that curves along the edge. The atmosphere is tranquil and slightly mysterious due to the haze, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the urban landscape rather than focusing on any individual person or object. There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the overall mood and expanse of the cityscape, highlighting the interplay between architecture, water, and weather.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
