    "pre_caption": "This video presents a fast-paced, disorienting aerial cityscape scenery shot, captured from a first-person perspective as it swoops and dives through a dense urban environment at dusk. The sky is painted with soft orange and pink hues above a skyline of illuminated skyscrapers and buildings under construction. A large construction site is a prominent feature below, characterized by a tall red crane, exposed earth, and the skeletal frames of new structures. The rapid, swooping motion of the camera creates significant motion blur, transforming city lights into dynamic streaks and preventing any single building or object from becoming the main subject. Instead, the focus is on conveying the exhilarating and vertiginous experience of flying through the vast, developing urban landscape, emphasizing the scale and energy of the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
