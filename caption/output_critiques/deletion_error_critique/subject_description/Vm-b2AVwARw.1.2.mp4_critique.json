    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a modern urban environment from a high vantage point. The focus is on the expansive view of the city, with sleek, tall skyscrapers stretching into the sky, reflecting the soft hues of a setting or rising sun. The scene includes a spacious balcony with contemporary furniture, such as cushioned chairs and a small table, which adds to the luxurious and serene atmosphere. The emphasis is on the vastness and architectural beauty of the cityscape, rather than any specific object, highlighting the environment and scale of the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
