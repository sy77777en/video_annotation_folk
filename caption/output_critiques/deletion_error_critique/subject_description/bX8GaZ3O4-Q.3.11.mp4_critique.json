    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up scenery shot of a luxurious poolside at night. The focus is on the overall atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating an immersive environmental view. The pool water glows with an ethereal green light from below, its surface dotted with dark leaves. Arcing jets of water, catching the green luminescence, spray into the pool from its stone edge. In the background, a large house with a tiled roof is softly illuminated by warm wall lanterns, and tall palm trees are silhouetted against the dark, starry sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
