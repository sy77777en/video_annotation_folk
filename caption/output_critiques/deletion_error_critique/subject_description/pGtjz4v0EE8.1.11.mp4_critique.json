    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot, offering a sweeping view of the interior of the Colosseum in Rome. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and historical grandeur of the ancient amphitheater. The camera pans across the vast, ruined structure, revealing its elliptical shape and multiple tiers of arched corridors. Much of the original arena floor is missing, exposing the intricate network of subterranean tunnels and chambers of the hypogeum below, now overgrown with patches of green grass. Tourists, appearing small in comparison to the massive stone walls, can be seen walking along the remaining pathways and gathered on a modern wooden platform that extends over a portion of the exposed lower level. The overcast sky casts a soft, even light over the weathered brown and grey stone, enhancing the monument's ancient and timeworn atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
