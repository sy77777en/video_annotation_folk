    "pre_caption": "This is a residential scenery shot capturing a quiet street corner in a Japanese neighborhood on a bright, sunny day. The view pans slowly from a traditional-style house with a tiled roof and red curtains to reveal the narrow street, which is lined with concrete block walls, modern fences, and other homes. Lush green trees and bushes add to the tranquil atmosphere under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds, while a convex traffic mirror stands prominently at the corner. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's deliberate movement is intended to showcase the environment itself, emphasizing the peaceful and ordinary character of the suburban setting rather than any specific action or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
