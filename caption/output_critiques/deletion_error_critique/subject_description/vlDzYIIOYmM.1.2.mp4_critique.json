    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a majestic mountain valley under a clear, star-filled night sky. Towering, snow-covered mountains flank a dark, still body of water that reflects the celestial light. The scene is dramatically lit, with cool moonlight illuminating the rugged slopes on one side of the valley, while the other side remains in deep shadow. A small, warm artificial light in the foreground provides a subtle contrast to the vast, cold wilderness. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the immense scale, serene atmosphere, and breathtaking beauty of the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
