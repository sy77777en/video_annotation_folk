    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot of an arid, desert environment. A tall, weathered white lighthouse with a dark-roofed lantern room stands centrally on a bed of large, smooth rocks, while the view slowly elevates to reveal a vast expanse of hazy, rolling desert mountains and pale sand dunes stretching to the horizon under a clear, light-blue sky. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the immense scale and desolate atmosphere of the environment. The lighthouse serves as a focal point that accentuates the vastness of the surrounding landscape, making the environment itself the primary subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
