    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape of Paris at night. The iconic Eiffel Tower, illuminated in a warm, golden-yellow hue, stands as the central beacon against the dark, hazy sky. Stretching out from its base is a vast expanse of the city, a glittering sea of countless lights from streets and buildings, with a large, brightly lit classical-style building positioned in the foreground. The composition emphasizes the grand scale and serene atmosphere of the nocturnal urban environment, making the entire cityscape the subject rather than focusing on a single element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
