    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing the opulent interior of a grand, baroque-style hall. The camera glides smoothly over a highly polished, checkered marble floor that reflects the ornate surroundings. The walls are adorned with large, dramatic paintings in dark, gilded frames, set above rich wood paneling, while a lavishly decorated ceiling with a central fresco adds to the sense of grandeur. At the far end of the long hall stands an elaborate white marble altar featuring a central statue. There is no single main subject in this video; the focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, using a wide-angle perspective and slow movement to emphasize the immense scale, rich detail, and solemn atmosphere of the architectural space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
