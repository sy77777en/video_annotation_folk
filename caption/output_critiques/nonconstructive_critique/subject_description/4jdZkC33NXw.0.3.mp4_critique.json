    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential neighborhood on a rainy day. The focus is on the broad, wet streets lined with modern houses, parked cars, and lush green hedges, all under a soft, overcast sky that diffuses the light and enhances the tranquil atmosphere. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall environment and mood, highlighting the calmness and scale of the urban setting rather than any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
