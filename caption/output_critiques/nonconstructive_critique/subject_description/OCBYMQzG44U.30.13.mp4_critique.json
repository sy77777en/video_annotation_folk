    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a stark, modernistic room. The space is defined by its curved walls, which feature a two-tone design with a dark, textured lower section and a smooth, off-white upper portion that blends into the ceiling where several recessed lights cast a soft, greenish-hued glow. A striking geometric pattern of large white and black tiles dominates the floor, and a narrow, arched doorway is visible in the distance. There is no main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the architectural space itself. The wide, low-angle perspective emphasizes the room's unusual curves, stark contrasts, and enigmatic, empty atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
