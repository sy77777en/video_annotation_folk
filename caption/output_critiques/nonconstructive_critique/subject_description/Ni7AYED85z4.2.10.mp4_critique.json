    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a wide, wet cobblestone promenade alongside a large body of water in Venice. Ornate, historic buildings with weathered facades line the right side of the walkway, while a classic, dark green lamppost with pink-tinted glass stands prominently in the foreground. The sky is overcast, and a light fog hangs over the water in the distance, creating a moody and reflective atmosphere on the damp pavement. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the expansive, atmospheric environment of the Venetian waterfront rather than any specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
