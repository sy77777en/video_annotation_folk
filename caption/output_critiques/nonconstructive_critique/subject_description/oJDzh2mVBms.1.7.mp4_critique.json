    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, where the primary focus is on the vastness of the environment and the atmospheric spectacle rather than a specific subject. Luminous, curtain-like bands of the green aurora borealis dominate the star-dusted night sky, appearing to radiate from a point on the left and stretching across the entire frame. Below, a flat, expansive snow-covered landscape is sparsely populated with a small, brightly lit white building that emits a plume of white steam or smoke. A line of dark evergreen trees forms the distant horizon, punctuated by two small, blinking red lights on unseen towers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The description of the aurora as \"appearing to radiate from a point on the left and stretching across the entire frame\" is inaccurate. The caption incorrectly states there is a \"small, brightly lit white building that emits a plume of white steam or smoke\" when there are multiple buildings and plumes. The description of the red lights as \"blinking\" is incorrect.",
