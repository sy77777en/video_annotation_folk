    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot of the bustling St. Mark's Square in Venice under a partly cloudy blue sky. The grand St. Mark's Basilica, an exemplary piece of Italo-Byzantine architecture, fills the background with its intricate facade, featuring multiple golden-topped domes, elaborate spires, and shimmering mosaics above its arched entrances. To the right, the towering, solid brick structure of St. Mark's Campanile rises high into the frame. The expansive paved square in the foreground is alive with the movement of numerous tourists strolling about, their long shadows stretching across the ground in the bright sunlight. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, static perspective is intended to capture the overall atmosphere, architectural grandeur, and vibrant energy of this iconic public space, making the environment itself the focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
