    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a wide, fast-flowing river with white-capped rapids, flanked by rocky riverbanks. On the left bank, a line of green trees and vegetation extends towards distant, hazy mountains. The right bank is a broad expanse of lighter-colored rocks and pebbles, leading up to a steep, tree-covered hill with exposed, lighter-colored patches of earth or rock. The sky above is blue with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the expansive natural environment, the dynamic movement of the water, and the overall atmosphere of the scene, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the landscape rather than a particular object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
