    "pre_caption": "This video presents a tranquil landscape scenery shot of a tropical lagoon at either sunrise or sunset. A row of overwater bungalows, rendered as dark silhouettes, stands on stilts above the calm, reflective water. In the background, a large, jagged mountain range is also silhouetted against a dramatic sky, where the sun glows brightly from behind a peak. The sky itself is a blend of deep teal and soft pink, with scattered clouds illuminated in vibrant shades of orange and rose. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the overall serene atmosphere and picturesque beauty of the environment, emphasizing the scale and color of the natural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
