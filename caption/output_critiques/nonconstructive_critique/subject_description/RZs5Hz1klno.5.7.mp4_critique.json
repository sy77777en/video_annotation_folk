    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, arid expanse under a hazy, pink-hued sky. The camera glides over rolling, brownish hills and sparse vegetation, following dirt tracks that lead towards a remote facility in the distance, identified as Pine Gap. This complex is distinguished by a series of large, white, spherical domes. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the immense scale and isolation of the environment, with the slow aerial movement and atmospheric lighting emphasizing the desolate and mysterious quality of the location.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
