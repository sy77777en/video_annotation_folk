    "pre_caption": "The video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot overlooking the immense expanse of the Grand Canyon under a turbulent sky. Heavy, billowing white and dark grey clouds dominate the view, set against patches of deep blue. In the distance, curtains of rain fall from the storm clouds, partially obscuring the far-off canyon walls. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the sheer scale of the natural wonder and the powerful, atmospheric weather conditions. The focus is on capturing the grandeur of the environment rather than a specific object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
