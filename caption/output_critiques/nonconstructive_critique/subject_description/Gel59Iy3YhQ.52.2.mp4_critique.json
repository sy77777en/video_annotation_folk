    "pre_caption": "The video presents a night-time forest scenery shot, where the focus is on the ethereal atmosphere created by numerous small, glowing orbs rather than a specific subject. These orbs, predominantly bright white with a few interspersed blue ones, are scattered throughout the dark environment, illuminating the silhouettes of tall, indistinct trees and the dimly lit ground. The scene is characterized by a strong contrast between these point-like lights and the surrounding darkness, with the overall effect being one of a mysterious and enchanting nocturnal woodland. The absence of a central subject directs attention to the overall mood and the distribution of these luminous particles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
