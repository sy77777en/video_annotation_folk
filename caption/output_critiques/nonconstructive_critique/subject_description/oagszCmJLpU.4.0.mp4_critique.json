    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at dusk or dawn. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. The sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent formation of storm clouds, tinged with deep purple and violet hues. Intermittent flashes of lightning illuminate the clouds from within, revealing their complex, layered structure, while a brighter, pinkish glow emanates from the horizon, creating a stark contrast with the dark, ominous cloud mass that looms over a silhouetted landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
