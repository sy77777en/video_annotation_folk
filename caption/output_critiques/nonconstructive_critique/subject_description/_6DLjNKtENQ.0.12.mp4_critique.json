    "pre_caption": "This is a high-angle cityscape scenery shot overlooking a wide, dark river flowing through a city. A prominent reddish-brown bascule bridge, distinguished by its truss structure and a stone control tower, spans the water, with a convoy of tan military vehicles crossing it from right to left. The river is active with various watercraft, including a bright orange tour boat filled with passengers in the foreground, a larger white tour boat further back, and smaller speedboats leaving white wakes on the surface. The shot lacks a single main subject; its elevated and wide perspective is used to establish the scale of the urban environment and the juxtaposition of civilian leisure and military movement. The focus is on the overall atmosphere of the scene rather than any specific character or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
