    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot capturing a waterfall through the foliage of a forest. The video begins with a soft, out-of-focus view that gradually sharpens to reveal the bright, cascading water in the background, framed by the dark, silhouetted shapes of leaves and branches in the foreground. There is no single main subject because the composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and the layered perspective of looking through the dense woods to the powerful natural feature beyond. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of discovery rather than a specific object. The interplay between the dark foreground and the bright background creates a sense of depth and makes the entire scene the subject of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
