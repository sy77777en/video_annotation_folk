    "pre_caption": "This is an interior architectural scenery shot capturing a dimly lit, narrow corridor with greenish-hued tiled walls, its lower half submerged in dark, rippling water. At the corridor's end, a white spiral staircase, also partially inundated, ascends into the gloom. The scene is pervaded by a faint, eerie green light, with a brighter, circular light source visible in the distance near the staircase, contributing to the unsettling atmosphere. The focus is on the mysterious and liminal quality of the environment itself, emphasizing the stark architectural forms and the incongruous flooding, rather than on a distinct subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
