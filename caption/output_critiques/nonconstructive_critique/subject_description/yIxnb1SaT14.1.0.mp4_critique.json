    "pre_caption": "This video captures a static cityscape scenery shot, offering a sweeping panoramic view of Paris at night from a high vantage point. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the expansive urban environment and its nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the scale and beauty of the city. The iconic Eiffel Tower, brilliantly illuminated in gold, dominates the right side of the frame, its powerful searchlight beam cutting through the dark, overcast sky. Further in the distance, a large Ferris wheel glows with bright white light, and the golden dome of another historic building is visible, creating a captivating tableau of famous landmarks against the night.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
