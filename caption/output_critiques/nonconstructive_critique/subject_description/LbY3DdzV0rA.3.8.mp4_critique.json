    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a thunderstorm at night. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vastness of the environment and the powerful atmospheric phenomena. A deep blue, star-filled sky provides a backdrop for massive, billowing storm clouds that are internally illuminated by frequent flashes of lightning, causing them to glow with vibrant pink and purple hues. Below the turbulent clouds, a dark, silhouetted landscape stretches across the horizon, punctuated by the twinkling lights of a distant city and the faint outline of power lines. Occasional, distinct bolts of lightning can be seen striking in the far distance, while faint streaks from satellites or airplanes traverse the clearer parts of the upper sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
