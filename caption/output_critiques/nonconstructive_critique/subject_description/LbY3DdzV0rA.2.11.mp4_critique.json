    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic time-lapse of a sunset over a vast canyon. The expansive canyon, with its layered rock formations, is cast in deep shadow, while a thin, reflective river winds through its base. The sky is a spectacle of contrasting elements: on the left, the setting sun creates a brilliant golden-orange glow with visible sunbeams, while on the right, dark, voluminous storm clouds gather, with rain visibly falling in the distance. The clouds drift across the frame as the sun sinks, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the powerful, atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the grandeur of the landscape rather than any single object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
