    "pre_caption": "This video is a cityscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a city street at night. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and the atmosphere of the nocturnal drive, rather than on any specific object. The camera's steady forward motion through an intersection, past rows of parked cars and under the glow of streetlights, serves to create a sense of place and experience. The scene is defined by the dark surroundings, the reflections on the car's hood, and the painted \"STOP\" marking on the asphalt, all contributing to the ambient urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
