    "pre_caption": "This video presents a vast and desolate industrial landscape scenery shot, likely depicting a quarry or mining operation inside a massive cavern. The scene is dominated by enormous, conical piles of dark, granular material that dwarf the few simple, weathered buildings and utility poles scattered across the dusty ground. Towering, rough-hewn rock walls enclose the area, and a tiny, solitary human figure standing near the base of one pile starkly illustrates the immense scale of the environment. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the sheer size of the industrial operation and the somber, hazy atmosphere of the location, rather than on any specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
