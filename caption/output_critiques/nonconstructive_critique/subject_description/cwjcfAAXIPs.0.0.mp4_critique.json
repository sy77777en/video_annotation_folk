    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing an aerial view of a city at sunrise, almost completely enveloped in a thick, rolling sea of fog. The low sun on the horizon bathes the scene in a warm, golden light, illuminating the tops of the clouds. Only the highest points of the city are visible, including a distinctive white church perched on a hill to the right and the silhouettes of other buildings and distant hills in the background. There is no main subject in this shot; the focus is instead on the grand, ethereal atmosphere created by the vast blanket of fog and the soft morning light, emphasizing the scale and mood of the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
