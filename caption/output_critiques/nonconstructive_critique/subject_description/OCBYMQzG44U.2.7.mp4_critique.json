    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot depicting a long, narrow, and seemingly endless corridor. The focus is on the disorienting and vast scale of the environment itself, creating an eerie, liminal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific subject. Every surface, including the floor and the towering parallel walls, is covered in a uniform grid of small, pale yellowish-green tiles with dark grout lines. The space is filled with a thick, hazy fog that obscures the far end of the corridor, and the scene is bathed in a diffuse, sourceless light of the same sickly green-yellow hue, enhancing the unsettling and sterile quality of the location. The perspective is slightly distorted with darkened, curved edges, as if viewed from inside a mask or through a wide-angle lens.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
