    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the architectural grandeur of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The camera slowly tilts upwards, showcasing the historic red-brick building with its white-trimmed windows, central clock tower, and a statue in the foreground, all set against a backdrop of modern skyscrapers and a clear sky. An American flag flies to the left of the building. There is no single main subject, as the shot aims to capture the overall environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the scale of the landmark and its place within the urban landscape, rather than a specific object or individual. The manicured green lawn in the immediate foreground and the symmetrical arcades flanking the main structure contribute to the sense of place and historical significance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
