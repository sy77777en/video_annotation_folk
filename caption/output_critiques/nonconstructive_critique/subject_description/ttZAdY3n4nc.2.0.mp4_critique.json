    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot depicting a dirt path winding through a dense, dark forest. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and enchantment. Trees with thick, green foliage arch over the trail, forming a natural tunnel that recedes into the distance. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled light and long shadows across the leaf-strewn ground. At the far end of the arboreal tunnel, a brighter, hazy light glows, suggesting an opening or clearing just beyond view. Small, luminous particles, resembling fireflies or magical motes, drift through the air, further enhancing the scene's ethereal quality.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
