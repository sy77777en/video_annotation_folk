    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping panoramic landscape and cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high vantage point on a rocky, pine-dotted hillside. The view encompasses a historic walled city with a dense cluster of terracotta-roofed buildings nestled on a peninsula, complete with a bustling harbor filled with boats. Beyond the city lies the deep blue expanse of the sea, where a large, verdant island sits prominently offshore, accompanied by various vessels, including a large cruise ship and smaller boats. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the grand scale and picturesque setting of the location. The focus is on the harmonious composition of the natural and man-made elements. The camera's slow pan across the vista emphasizes the expansive environment rather than a specific entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
