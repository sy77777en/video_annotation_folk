    "pre_caption": "The video is a nighttime roadscape scenery shot, capturing a dimly lit, rain-soaked rural road bordered by grassy verges and utility poles. The wet pavement reflects the glare of oncoming headlights and the flashing lights of a stationary police car, creating a moody, atmospheric scene. The focus is on the environment and the interplay of light, weather, and open space, rather than any specific object or individual, emphasizing the ambiance and scale of the setting rather than a central subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
