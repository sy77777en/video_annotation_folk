    "pre_caption": "This video captures a breathtaking cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, viewed from the Pont Alexandre III. In the foreground, a large, ornate golden-bronze statue of a male figure adorned with a laurel wreath gazes out over the scene. Beyond the statue, the dark Seine River reflects the shimmering golden lights of the city, with several other bridges visible in the mid-ground. The background is dominated by the brilliantly illuminated Eiffel Tower, which stands as a beacon against the dark night sky, surrounded by the sprawling, lit-up Parisian landscape. The shot does not have a single main subject; instead, its focus is on capturing the grand scale, romantic atmosphere, and iconic beauty of the Parisian environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
