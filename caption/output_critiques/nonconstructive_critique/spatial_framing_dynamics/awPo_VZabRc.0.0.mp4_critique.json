    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot at the subjects' level, viewed from outside a moving train car. Initially, an elderly woman is seated towards the center-right in the middle ground, with standing passengers, including a tall bearded man and a man seen from the back, positioned to her left and slightly more towards the foreground within the middle ground. The perspective then shifts steadily to the right, revealing successive groups of passengers inside the train, all in the middle ground. Throughout this rightward progression, out-of-focus columns and, at intervals, larger riveted train pillars pass from right to left in the immediate foreground, periodically interrupting the view of the passengers. This movement sequentially frames different individuals and groups: first, passengers including a man in a fedora and another in a baseball cap; then, after a foreground pillar passes, a man in a hoodie and another in a suit; and finally, following another pillar, a pale man in a black jacket and an overweight man in a pink shirt, all observed through the train windows.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows various animated characters inside a train car, viewed from the outside as the train passes. An elderly woman with short, curly white hair, wearing a brown top and a dark skirt, is seated on an orange bench. Nearby, a tall man with a long dark beard, clad in a light green t-shirt and dark pants, stands holding an overhead rail, partially obscuring another man in a dark suit. A man with spiky brown hair, seen from the back in a green t-shirt, also stands. As the view shifts to the right, the foreground outside the window consistently displays passing columns that remain out of focus as the subway progresses. Other seated passengers appear: a man in a grey fedora and dark jacket; a man with a black baseball cap worn backwards, a dark green jacket, and ripped jeans; and a man with dark hair and a prominent mustache, wearing a dark suit. Another seated man wears a light green hoodie with a graphic, a black baseball cap, and blue pants, his mouth agape. A pale-skinned man with dark messy hair, dressed in a black jacket over a white t-shirt and dark pants, sits with his legs spread. Finally, an overweight man in a pink, belly-exposing shirt and light blue pants is seen seated. Standing passengers include a woman with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a tan jacket, and another individual with a pink backpack.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows the exterior of a moving, light blue-grey subway car. Rectangular windows offer glimpses into the interior, where animated passengers are seated on orange seats. The subway car's metallic surface features visible rivets. Outside the windows, columns continuously pass by in the foreground, while the greyish blur of the subway car itself indicates movement during an overcast day.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
