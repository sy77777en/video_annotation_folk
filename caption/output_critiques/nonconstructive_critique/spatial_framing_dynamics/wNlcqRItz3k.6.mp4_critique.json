    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed from a slightly elevated angle, captures two men in the middle ground on a red running track. Initially, an athlete in a red tracksuit stands left of center, receiving a stuffed animal from a man in a blue jacket who is positioned to his right. They then shake hands in the center of the frame. Following the handshake, the man in the blue jacket moves down and towards the bottom right, while the athlete remains stationary on the left. The track's white lines extend from the foreground to the background, and a portion of a flag is visible in the top right corner throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two men stand on a red running track with white lines. The man on the left has short dark hair and tan skin. He wears a red tracksuit jacket with a white inner collar, and a silver medal hangs from a red ribbon around his neck. He holds a small, red and yellow lion-like stuffed animal mascot in his left hand. The second man, standing on the right, wears a light blue tracksuit jacket over a shirt with a red collar and the word \"MYANMAR\" printed in white across the back. He faces the first man and they shake hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set during the day on a reddish-brown athletics track with distinct white lane lines. An athlete wearing a red tracksuit with a silver-colored medal on a red ribbon stands on the track. He is holding a small, red and yellow plush mascot with a heart on its chest. He shakes hands with another man who is wearing a light blue jacket with the word \"MYANMAR\" printed in white letters across the back. In the upper right, a portion of a red and white striped flag is visible against the backdrop of the stadium.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
