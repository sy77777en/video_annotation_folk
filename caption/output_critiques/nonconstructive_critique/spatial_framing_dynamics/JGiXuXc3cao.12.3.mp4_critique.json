    "pre_caption": "The video presents a top-down view of a digital map, which serves as the background. In the middle ground, the red text \"TITANIC WRECK\" is positioned in the top center, above a glowing red circular target located slightly right of center. Directly below the target, a white box in the center displays coordinates. A white compass-like icon is fixed in the foreground at the bottom left. Throughout the shot, a glowing red dashed line animates to trace a large, irregular shape in the center of the frame. As this outline forms, a large, glowing white silhouette materializes within it, becoming progressively more visible in the middle ground while all other elements remain static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A digital map is displayed with a dark, textured background and a white grid overlay. A red, glowing circle with a central dot pinpoints a location labeled \"TITANIC WRECK\" in red text. Below this, a white box contains the coordinates \"41°43'32\"N, 49°56'49\"W\". A red, glowing, dashed line outlines a large, irregular area, within which a faint, glowing white silhouette appears. A circular compass icon is visible in the lower-left corner, featuring a diamond shape that is white on the top and black on the bottom.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A digital map with a dark, textured background is overlaid with a white grid. A red, glowing circular target marks a location identified by a red text overlay reading \"TITANIC WRECK.\" Below this, a white text overlay displays the coordinates \"41°43'32\"N, 49°56'49\"W.\" In the bottom-left corner, a white compass-like icon is present. A glowing, red, dashed line animates to trace the outline of a large, white, glowing silhouette that appears on the display.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
