    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot frames a large, illuminated \"Off World Islands\" billboard on the left side, in the middle ground. A dark silhouette of a man stands in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, on a wet, reflective surface. To the right, another illuminated billboard, \"Happy Pig,\" is positioned in the middle ground. Towering skyscrapers fill the background, extending across the upper portion and sides of the frame. The foreground, at the bottom of the frame, depicts a dark, cluttered rooftop. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, illuminated rectangular billboard on the left prominently displays a medium-full body image of a woman with blonde hair and fair skin, wearing a white two-piece bikini. She poses with her hands clasped behind her head, looking slightly to her left, standing on a sandy beach with a palm tree to her right, under the large yellow text \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS.\" In the center of the scene, a dark silhouette of a man, seemingly wearing a jacket, stands facing away from the viewer. To the right, another large, illuminated billboard shows a cartoonish pink pig wearing a white chef's hat, with the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24\" visible on a red and white background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a sprawling, futuristic cityscape at night, characterized by towering, dark skyscrapers dotted with lights. A blue-tinged, hazy atmosphere, due to rain falling over the city, is illuminated by numerous light sources, including beams cutting through the air. In the middle ground, a lone, silhouetted figure stands on a wet, reflective surface. The foreground depicts a flattened rooftop of a building, seemingly cluttered with some items, although the dark surroundings make it difficult to discern what they are. Dominating the left side is a large, glowing blue digital billboard displaying an advertisement for \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS,\" featuring a woman in a white bikini and a palm tree. To the right, another, smaller digital billboard shows a red and white advertisement with a pig-like character and the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24.\" The overall environment is dark, with the billboards and city lights providing the primary illumination.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
