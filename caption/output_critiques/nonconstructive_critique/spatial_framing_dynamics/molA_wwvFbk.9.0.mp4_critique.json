    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high angle, a light-colored vehicle lies on its side in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of center. Bare trees occupy the foreground and middle ground, with bright lights visible in the background on the left and right. A locomotive then enters from the background on the upper right and travels diagonally toward the center-left, colliding with the stationary vehicle. The camera pans left to follow the locomotive's movement, reframing the scene into a medium shot. This action makes the locomotive the central subject in the middle ground, pushing the first vehicle to the right of the frame as trees in the left foreground become more prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A long, light-colored passenger bus or train car lies crashed on its side in a dark, wooded area at night. The vehicle is tilted at a severe angle, with its lower half submerged in what appears to be water or mud. A red and dark-colored locomotive is moving from the upper right corner of the frame to the lower left corner, colliding with the long, light-colored passenger bus or train car, and is seen emitting smoke or steam. The entire scene is shrouded in thick fog and illuminated by several powerful, bright white lights, which create a hazy atmosphere and cast stark reflections. Surrounding the crash are numerous bare, dark trees, visible as silhouettes against the intense backlighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark and foggy wooded area at night, a large, light-colored vehicle resembling a bus or train car lies partially submerged in a body of water. The scene is starkly illuminated by powerful lights positioned among the bare trees, casting bright, distorted reflections on the water's surface. A wrecked train engine amidst the trees, with visible sparks and small flames erupting from the wreckage, is shown after colliding with the bus or train car and continuing to move towards the left side of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
