    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot, filmed from a high angle looking down, focuses on a glass bowl in the center of the middle ground. A hand enters the frame from the top right, holding a whisk that moves in a rapid circular motion to mix ingredients within the central bowl. To the left in the middle ground, a wooden board holds limes and a red measuring spoon, while a bunch of herbs occupies the bottom-left foreground. In the background at the top right, a bowl contains whole limes, and a glass jar of sea salt is positioned to the right in the middle ground. The surrounding elements remain static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned person's hand holds a metal wire whisk, actively mixing ingredients within a large, clear glass bowl. The bowl contains a mixture of finely chopped green herbs, a white crystalline powder, and a light greenish liquid. On the left side of the bowl, there are halved and squeezed green limes, a silver and red plastic measuring spoon, and a yellow squeezer, all placed on a wooden chopping board on the table. A bunch of fresh green herbs in a glass container is visible beside the chopping board. On the right side, a silver bowl contains several limes, and a smaller measuring spoon similar to the one on the left. Additionally, a clear glass jar with a handwritten label reading \"SEA SALT\" is filled with coarse white salt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot captures a vibrant food preparation scene on a light-colored, weathered wood plank surface. In the center, a hand uses a metal wire whisk to mix finely chopped green herbs, a white crystalline powder, and a light greenish liquid in a large, clear glass bowl. To the left, halved and squeezed green limes, a silver and red plastic measuring spoon, and a yellow squeezer rest on a wooden chopping board. A bunch of fresh green herbs stands in a glass container nearby. On the right, a silver bowl holds several whole limes and a smaller measuring spoon. A clear glass jar with a handwritten label reading \"SEA SALT\" contains coarse white salt. The scene is brightly lit, with all ingredients and tools thoughtfully arranged in the middle ground and background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
