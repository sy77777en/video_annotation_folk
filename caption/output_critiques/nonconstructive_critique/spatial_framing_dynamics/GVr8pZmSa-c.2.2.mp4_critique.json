    "pre_caption": "The video initially presents no distinct subject, with small, stone-like objects positioned in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. An overlay is visible in the bottom left foreground. A dark, out-of-focus silhouette occupies the center background. The shot then transitions as this silhouette gradually comes into focus, revealing a figure in the middle ground, center. As the figure clarifies, the shot evolves into a medium shot, framing them from the waist up. Throughout this reveal, the stone-like objects remain in the bottom foreground, and the overlay persists in the bottom left foreground. When the figure is fully revealed, the camera is positioned at their level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a static close-up of several small, stone-like objects on a brown surface. Then, a figure in a dark suit with crossed arms appears in the middle ground, initially out of focus, before gradually coming into sharper focus as the camera moves. Finally, the figure's head and facial features, including light hair, glasses, and a mustache, become visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a moderately lit indoor environment. On a reddish-brown table, scattered stones in a mix of teal, white, and reddish-brown are visible. A figure, rendered in a desaturated, almost grayscale palette. The figure is dressed in a dark suit and a lighter-colored collared shirt, with light-colored hair and round glasses. They stand with their arms crossed. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"ALBERT REHM\" at the top and \"GERMAN PHILOLOGIST\" at the bottom on a light beige background. The bottom right corner of the overlay features a pattern of three quarter-circle arcs. The overall atmosphere is somber and shadowy.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
