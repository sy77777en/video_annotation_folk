    "pre_caption": "A full, low-angle fisheye shot initially frames a man on a skateboard in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A large stone monument occupies the middle ground, extending from the left to the center, with a building visible in the background on the right. The man skateboards from the center toward the right, then turns and moves toward the bottom left, entering the foreground. The camera follows this movement, shifting from its initial position below the subject to a position at the subject's level as he moves closer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is shown skateboarding. He is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, loose-fitting blue jeans, white sneakers, and a dark-colored cap worn backward. He actively balances on the skateboard, shifting his weight and moving his arms. In the background, a person dressed in black is standing beside a statue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, fisheye shot captures an outdoor urban plaza under a cloudy daytime sky. The distorted perspective curves the horizon and frames the scene within a circular view. In the center is a large, dark stone monument with several tiers and prominent statues on top. The base of the monument is a wide, curved structure. In the background, a large, multi-story building with a classical facade and numerous windows lines the edge of the plaza. A person on a skateboard is seen moving along the curved base of the monument.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
