    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a silhouetted sailboat with a figure inside is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The boat floats on a calm body of water that occupies the middle ground. The scene is enveloped in thick fog in the middle ground and background. A beam of light extends from the top left toward the center. The entire composition is framed by a dark, blurry vignette in the foreground, which darkens the edges of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black silhouette of a small, child-like figure with a round head and a slender body is depicted sitting inside a small sailboat. The boat is also rendered as a black silhouette, featuring a simple hull and a single, thin mast. The entire presentation of the figure and the boat is in a stark, desaturated, black-and-white style, with soft, blurry edges.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video, a scene unfolds in a monochromatic, black-and-white style on a vast, calm body of water shrouded in thick, white fog. A dark silhouette of a small sailboat with a single mast is positioned in the center, floating on the water with a silhouetted figure inside. A soft beam of light shines down from the top center, extending towards the bottom left, cutting through the dense fog. The entire scene is framed by a dark, blurry vignette, focusing the view on the central boat.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
