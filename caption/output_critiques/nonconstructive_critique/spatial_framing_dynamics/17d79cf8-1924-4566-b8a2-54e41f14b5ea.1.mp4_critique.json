    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective looking down, the scene is framed with the person's legs and feet in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A large pile of red bricks occupies the top and center of the frame in the middle ground, while a light-colored bowl sits in the bottom left foreground and a smaller green bowl is at the very bottom edge. The person's hands move from the bottom of the frame into the center foreground, picking up a single red brick from the pile. The shot concludes with the hands holding the brick centrally in the foreground, positioned directly above the person's feet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person with brown skin is seen bending down amidst a pile of red clay bricks on a dirt floor. The person wears a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt, patterned bottoms, and blue flip-flops, with a black bracelet on their right wrist. They hold a rectangular red brick, which has a thin wire wrapped around it, in both hands. The surrounding bricks are of a similar type, many stamped with letters, some broken. Near the person's feet is a light-colored, shallow bowl containing a wet, grey mixture resembling mortar, and a smaller green bowl also holding a similar grey substance with a trowel handle sticking out.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks down at an outdoor work site during the day. The ground is uneven, reddish-brown dirt, scattered with a large pile of rectangular, reddish-orange clay bricks. Several bricks are stamped with a black \"RKB\" marking, and some are broken. A shallow, light-colored basin filled with wet, gray mortar sits on the ground next to the bricks, along with a smaller green basin also containing mortar. The person's feet, clad in blue flip-flops, are visible on the ground as their hands pick up a brick from the pile. A thin white wire is tangled within the pile of bricks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
