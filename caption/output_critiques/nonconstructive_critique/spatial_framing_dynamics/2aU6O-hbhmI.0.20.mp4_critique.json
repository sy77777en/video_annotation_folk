    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a cityscape, capturing a tall red brick and glass building prominently in the foreground. Initially, the building occupies the central-left portion of the frame, with its vertical lines and balconies extending upwards. The camera is positioned slightly below the building, looking up towards its upper floors. As the camera pans left, the building shifts towards the right side of the frame, revealing more of the surrounding urban environment in the background. This includes other high-rise buildings and construction cranes, which appear smaller due to their distance. The camera then tilts upward, focusing on the upper sections of the main building, emphasizing its height. Finally, the camera moves downward, providing a bird's-eye view of the ground and the surrounding structures. Throughout the sequence, the building remains the focal point, transitioning from a close-up perspective to a broader aerial view. The camera maintains a consistent height relative to the building, ensuring the urban landscape is captured dynamically.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures the towering presence of a red brick and glass building, emphasizing its height and architectural details. The focus is on the urban environment, showcasing the building's vertical lines and the surrounding city structures. The perspective highlights the scale and atmosphere of the city, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The lighting and angles contribute to the dynamic and immersive feel of the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a cityscape at dusk. The setting is outdoors, featuring a tall, modern residential building with a red brick facade and large glass windows. Balconies protrude from the structure, adding depth and texture. The building's vertical lines and geometric shapes are prominent, with reflections of the fading daylight visible on the glass surfaces. As the camera pans left, it captures urban scenes featuring multiple high-rise buildings and cranes, hinting at a densely built environment. The sky transitions from a muted blue to a darker hue, indicating the approach of night. Streetlights and interior lights begin to illuminate, casting a warm glow that contrasts with the cool tones of the evening sky. As the camera continues to move, it refocuses on the main building and concludes with a bird's-eye view of the ground, also highlighting the surrounding structures. The drone's movement provides a dynamic perspective, showcasing the height and scale of the architecture against the urban backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
