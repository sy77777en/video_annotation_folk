    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle perspective, positioning the camera above the scene. A 2D animated cat is superimposed in the center-left of the frame, standing in the middle ground on a large bed. The bed itself occupies the center and bottom of the frame, also in the middle ground, with its beige headboard extending into the background at the top-center. To the right, a nightstand sits in the middle ground, holding a telephone, while a lamp on it reaches into the top-right background. A corresponding nightstand is positioned on the left in the middle ground, with wine glasses on its surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A gray-blue cartoon cat, recognizable as Tom from the \"Tom and Jerry\" series, is the central subject, presented in a 2D animation style. The cat has a lighter gray-blue torso, a white muzzle, white paws, and pink inner ears. He is depicted standing on a bed, hunched over and holding a green bottle with a red and yellow patterned sticker featuring blue letters. The atypical appearance stems from the superimposition of this flat, animated character onto a photorealistic, three-dimensional bedroom scene, creating a stark contrast between the two visual styles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, the scene captures a modern bedroom illuminated by warm artificial light. In the center is a large bed with a tall, beige, vertically tufted headboard. The bed is neatly made with white pillows and a sage-green quilted blanket. Flanking the bed are two dark, rectangular nightstands with metallic gold frames. On the right nightstand sits a lamp with a white rectangular shade and a black telephone. The left nightstand holds a matching lamp and several empty wine glasses. An animated, blue-grey cartoon cat is overlaid on the scene, standing on the bed and holding a green bottle.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
