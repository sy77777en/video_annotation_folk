    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, showing a figure in white occupying the left foreground, partially out of frame. To the right, a large vault door is positioned in the middle ground. The camera's focus then shifts, causing the vault door to move into the left foreground as an out-of-focus framing element. This transition reveals a full shot of three figures seated at desks in the background. These figures are arranged in a horizontal row, with one in the center-left, one in the center, and one on the right side of the frame, all viewed from behind. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level in both the initial and final compositions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pregnant figure in a white garment stands in front of an open, large, dark, textured vault door that features a prominent wheel lock. The view then shifts to reveal the room behind the door, where three mannequin-like figures are seated with their backs to the camera. These figures, which have bald, shiny heads, are positioned in a row at individual white desks. Each figure sits in a black office chair and is focused on a computer screen. They are dressed in simple, short-sleeved t-shirts in pale shades of purple, pink, and blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, monochromatic setting, a figure in a white garment stands in front of a heavy, textured vault door featuring a large, spoked wheel handle. The view shifts to reveal the room beyond the door, which has a dark, tiled floor. Inside, three bald, mannequin-like figures are seated with their backs to the camera at separate white desks, each working on a computer in a black office chair. The significant light in the dim room emanates from the computer monitors and an unseen source above the frame. White subtitles with a black outline are present as an overlay at the bottom of the screen, stating, \"[17].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
