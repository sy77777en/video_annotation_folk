    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person in a red pineapple shirt is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To their left, the arm and torso of another person are visible in the foreground. The red interior of a car occupies the foreground and middle ground, while a canopy of bright lights fills the background at the top of the frame. The entire scene is warped by a significant visual distortion. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with long, dark hair is getting out of a convertible sports car, wearing a red, short-sleeved shirt with a yellow pineapple print over striped pants. To his left, a partially visible man with dark skin is wearing a t-shirt with red sleeves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime scene unfolds with a Black man exiting a sports car, characterized by significant visual distortion that warps the entire view. The middle ground features a wavy, white molded seat inside the red car. Overhead, a canopy is densely covered with small, warm, glowing lights, creating a bright, blurred background. The scene is filled with warm tones of red and yellow, and the distorted lens effect creates chromatic aberration at the edges.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
