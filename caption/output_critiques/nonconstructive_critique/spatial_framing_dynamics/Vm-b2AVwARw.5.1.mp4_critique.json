    "pre_caption": "The video is a full shot, with the camera positioned above the subject. The light brown, textured paper occupies the majority of the frame in the middle ground, set against a dark brown wooden surface visible at the frame's edges in the background. At the top center of the paper, the word \"Kafala\" is printed. Below this, in the top center area of the paper, a businessman icon is positioned. A worker icon is located in the center of the paper. A dotted line with a chain link connects the businessman icon above to the worker icon. To the right of this chain, near the top right relative to the worker, a \"VISA\" card icon is present. Initially, a document icon is to the left of the worker, and a barred window icon is to the bottom left of the worker. As the video progresses, a clock icon appears to the right of the worker. Subsequently, a passport icon appears below the clock, positioned to the bottom right of the worker. Then, a clenched fist icon materializes directly below the worker. Finally, an icon depicting a whip and a building appears to the left of the businessman icon, near the top left relative to the worker. All icons and text are in the middle ground on the paper.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a diagram on light brown, textured paper, titled \"Kafala\" in a black, bold, sans-serif font at the top. Central to the diagram is a black silhouette icon of a worker wearing a hard hat and overalls, facing forward. Above the worker, a black silhouette icon of a person in a suit and tie is connected to the worker by a dotted line featuring a chain link pattern. To the right of this chain, a black rectangular icon resembling a credit card is labeled \"VISA\" in white capital letters. The worker icon is further connected by simple black dotted lines to several other black icons. To the worker's left is an icon of a rectangular document with a small, indistinct image. Below and to the left of the worker is an icon resembling a barred window. Below the worker is an icon of a clenched fist with zig-zag lines emanating from it. To the worker's right is an icon of a circular clock face with hands. Below the clock icon is an icon of a passport with a globe symbol on its cover. An additional icon appears to the left of the worker, depicting a whip and a building with columns. An overlay number is visible in the bottom left of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a light brown, textured piece of paper resting on a dark brown wooden surface. At the top center of the paper, the word \"Kafala\" is printed in black. Below this, a diagram in black ink illustrates a central figure of a worker in a hard hat. A dotted line with a chain link connects this worker to an icon of a businessman in a suit positioned above. Another dotted line connects the worker to a \"VISA\" card icon to the right. As the video progresses, additional black icons appear around the central worker, connected by dotted lines: a document icon to the left, a barred window icon below and to the left, a clenched fist icon directly below, a passport icon below and to the right, and a clock icon to the right. Later, an icon depicting a whip and a building appears to the left of the businessman icon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
