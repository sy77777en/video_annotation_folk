    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a young man is positioned in the right foreground, remaining stationary and in focus. In the left background, a second man, who is out of focus, throws a playing card from the left side of the frame. The card flies through the middle ground toward the right, striking and shattering a graham cracker located in the middle ground on the left. The resulting fragments scatter as the card continues its trajectory. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short brown hair and a short beard is in the foreground, looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. He wears a maroon t-shirt with the white text \"THE LEGENDARY\" and a red baseball cap backward. In the middleground, a middle-aged, light-skinned man in a white t-shirt throws a red playing card. The card flies through the air and slices a rectangular, light-brown graham cracker in half, causing it to shatter into small pieces. The man in the middleground has a concentrated expression with his mouth slightly open.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors during the day, with a large, textured tree trunk and green foliage forming the background. A rectangular graham cracker is thrown by a man wearing a red baseball cap and a maroon t-shirt with white lettering. After throwing the cracker, the first man stands still in the foreground. A red-backed playing card, thrown by a second man, travels from the background towards the foreground and strikes the cracker, causing it to shatter into fragments.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
