    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a tropical landscape. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by the water of a lagoon, which extends from the foreground into the middle ground. A horizontal row of silhouetted overwater bungalows sits in the middle ground, stretching from the left side to the center-right of the frame. In the background, a large mountain range is positioned on the right, with the sun's glow visible behind a peak. The sky and clouds fill the top half of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, close to the surface of the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a tranquil landscape scenery shot of a tropical lagoon at either sunrise or sunset. A row of overwater bungalows, rendered as dark silhouettes, stands on stilts above the calm, reflective water. In the background, a large, jagged mountain range is also silhouetted against a dramatic sky, where the sun glows brightly from behind a peak. The sky itself is a blend of deep teal and soft pink, with scattered clouds illuminated in vibrant shades of orange and rose. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the overall serene atmosphere and picturesque beauty of the environment, emphasizing the scale and color of the natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view of a tropical lagoon is shown at sunrise or sunset. A row of silhouetted overwater bungalows with thatched roofs stands on stilts above the calm water. In the background, a large mountain is also silhouetted against the sky. The sky displays a gradient from dark teal to soft pink, with clouds illuminated by the warm light of the sun, which is positioned behind the mountain. The surface of the water gently ripples, reflecting the colors of the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
