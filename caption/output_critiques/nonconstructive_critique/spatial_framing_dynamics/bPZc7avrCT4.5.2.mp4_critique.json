    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a person's hands holding a cordless drill in the left and center foreground. A yellow balloon, attached to the drill's bit, is positioned in the center-right foreground, with a blurred forest visible in the background. The balloon spins in place, and then detaches, flying from its starting position toward the right side of the frame and slightly downward, eventually moving out of view. The hands and drill remain stationary on the left throughout the action. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light-skinned hands holds a yellow and black DeWalt cordless drill horizontally. Attached to the drill's chuck is a red, cylindrical hole saw bit. A partially inflated yellow balloon is stretched over the end of this bit. As the drill is activated, the balloon spins rapidly, its shape distorting due to the motion, before it detaches from the bit and flies away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting with a blurred background of trees, a person holds a yellow and black cordless drill. Attached to the drill is a red, cylindrical hole saw bit, over which an inflated yellow balloon is stretched. As the drill spins, the balloon wobbles and deforms before detaching and flying toward the lower right of the frame, remaining partially visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
