    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man in a spacesuit, who is positioned in the center foreground. In the background, a vast, dark, and complex geometric structure with scattered, out-of-focus lights extends into the distance. The shot slowly pushes in, transitioning to a close-up that tightens the frame on the man's helmet and upper torso, while he remains centered. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, identified by a name tag as \"COOPER,\" is shown from the chest up, centered and facing forward. He is wearing a white and grey spacesuit with a circular \"NASA\" patch positioned in the center of his chest. He wears a large, dark helmet with a clear visor, through which his face is partially visible in the dim light. He appears to be a middle-aged man with fair skin. The lighting is dramatic, illuminating parts of his suit and face while leaving much of him in shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An astronaut in a white spacesuit with \"NASA\" and \"COOPER\" patches is centrally positioned within a vast, dark, and complex interior space. The environment is a seemingly infinite, multi-dimensional lattice composed of what appear to be endless rows of bookshelves, extending in all directions. Small, warm, out-of-focus lights are scattered throughout this geometric structure, creating a sense of immense depth. The scene is dimly lit, with the primary illumination focused on the front of the astronaut's suit, while the face inside the dark helmet remains mostly in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
