    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot where the main subject, a young man, is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting on a yellow couch while reading a book. In the right foreground, the back of another man with dreadlocks partially frames the shot as he also reads. In the left background, two women are seated at a small table. The composition remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in framing or subject position. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a young man with short, curly dark hair, who is sitting on a yellow couch. He wears a grey tie-dye t-shirt with a single red horizontal stripe across the chest and black pants. He is looking down intently, reading a book that he holds open with both hands. In the immediate foreground, the back and side of a dark-skinned man with black dreadlocks are visible; he is wearing a black ribbed high-neck shirt and is also holding an open book. In the background, two women are seated at a small table. The woman on the left, seen from the back, has long dark hair and wears a white shirt. The woman to her right has wavy, reddish-blonde hair and is dressed in a beige shirt and dark pants; she is seen in profile, holding a pen in her right hand and gesturing with it, as if she is speaking.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a brightly lit, modern indoor space during the daytime. The room has white walls, a light gray floor, and large windows in the background that illuminate the area with natural light. In the foreground and midground, two individuals are seated on a mustard-yellow, textured fabric sofa, each reading a book. Further back, two women are at a small, round table with a black top and thin metal legs. They are seated on pink, upholstered chairs that have slender, gold-colored legs. A light-colored, patterned rug is partially visible on the floor between the sofa and the table.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
