    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a woman standing in the background at the center of a hallway. She walks towards the camera, moving from the background to the middle ground, causing the framing to transition into a medium shot. She stops in the center-right of the frame and turns to her left, looking into a dark doorway. As she turns, a tall, silhouetted figure is revealed standing motionless inside the doorway, positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. A closed wooden door occupies the left foreground throughout the shot. The camera remains static and at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with brown hair pulled back into a bun walks barefoot down a hallway. She is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved, button-down pajama shirt with a plaid pattern. As she raises her left arm to turn off the light, she turns to look into a dark doorway, where a tall, slender, silhouetted figure of a person is seen standing motionless in the darkness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a long, narrow residential hallway with white walls and light-colored wood plank flooring. On the left, a closed wooden door is visible. The right wall is adorned with a few framed pictures, and a white light switch is located on the white wall at the corner of the hall. At the far end of the corridor, another doorway opens into a separate space. A woman wearing a plaid nightshirt walks from the back of the hallway toward the camera. She stops and turns to her left, looking into a doorway just as the light within that room extinguishes, revealing a dark, silhouetted figure standing in the unlit space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
