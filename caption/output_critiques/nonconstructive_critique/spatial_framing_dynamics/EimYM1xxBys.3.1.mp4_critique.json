    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a small figure is initially visible in the center-right middle ground, partially obscured by a large tree silhouette in the left foreground. The camera pans from left to right, tracking the figure as it runs across a grassy clearing in the middle ground. As the camera moves, the initial foreground tree exits the frame, and other silhouetted trees pass through the foreground and middle ground. The pan concludes by revealing large, dark industrial structures in the right background, with the figure now positioned in the center-left middle ground. A white logo is consistently visible in the bottom right foreground. The camera maintains a side-on perspective at the subject's height throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a low-light environment, a human figure is visible wearing dark pants and a dark reddish top. The individual's light skin is noticeable on their hands and part of their face, which is partially covered by a mask over the lower half. The figure is consistently small and seen from a distance, making finer details of their features or clothing difficult to discern against the dark, silhouetted surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video captures a scene set within a dark, misty forest at night. The camera moves to the right across a grassy clearing populated by the dark silhouettes of trees. As the character approaches the industrial area, large, angular, industrial-style structures and a single red light become visible through the dense, blue-green mist. A white 'IGN' logo is present as a watermark in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
