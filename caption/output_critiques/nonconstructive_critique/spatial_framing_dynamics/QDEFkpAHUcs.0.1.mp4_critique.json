    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a line of soldiers arranged diagonally from the left foreground toward the right background. Initially, the focus is on the soldiers in the middle ground, while the soldier in the immediate left foreground is out of focus. The shot then transitions to a medium shot as the camera's focus shifts down the line, revealing the full extent of the formation stretching into the background. In the final framing, the line of soldiers continues to occupy the diagonal space, and a stone building becomes visible in the right background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A long, straight line of men dressed in historical military uniforms stands at attention in profile, all facing to the right. Each man wears a tall, black, furry hat, likely a bearskin, which is secured under his chin with a gold, scaled chin strap. Their uniforms feature red coats with white crossbelts and dark, high collars. A white, star-shaped insignia is visible on the collar of the soldier in the foreground. The men hold rifles upright in front of them, and the line extends from the close-up foreground deep into the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a stone courtyard, where a long line of soldiers stands in formation, viewed from the side. The soldiers wear uniforms featuring tall, black, furry hats, red coats with white crossbelts, and decorative gold-colored chin straps. In the background, the stone facade of a large building is visible. The camera's focus shifts from the soldiers in the foreground down the length of the line, gradually revealing the extent of the formation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
