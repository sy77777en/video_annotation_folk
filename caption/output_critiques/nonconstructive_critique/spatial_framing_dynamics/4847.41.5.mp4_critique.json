    "pre_caption": "This static shot presents a silent film intertitle card. A decorative, light-gold border is positioned at the edges of the frame. In the foreground, a logo for \"DECLA\" is located at the top center, and the text \"Later.\" is situated in the center of the frame. These elements are presented against a black background that occupies the space within the border. The entire composition is static, with no changes in the position or size of any elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A silent film intertitle card is presented on a black background. In the center of the card, the word \"Later.\" appears in a light gold, serif font. Positioned at the top center is a light gold logo for \"DECLA,\" which includes a stylized bird with outstretched wings above the text. The entire card is framed by a thin, decorative border in the same light gold color, featuring curved corners and a notch at the top to accommodate the logo.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This video presents a static overlay styled as a silent film intertitle. A decorative, light-gold border with curved corners frames a black background. At the top center, a small logo overlay shows a bird with outstretched wings above the word \"DECLA.\" In the center of the screen, the single word \"Later.\" is displayed as a text overlay in a light-gold serif font.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
