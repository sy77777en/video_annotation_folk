    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a young man is positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a laptop is visible on the left, and a tripod leg is on the right. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with a light skin tone and long, wavy, shoulder-length hair is depicted. His hair is a light brown or dark blonde color. He is wearing what appears to be a school uniform, which includes a dark navy blazer with a crest on the left breast pocket, a white collared shirt, and a dark, patterned tie. He is sitting down, smiling, and turning his head to the right, looking at someone else.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor room with cool-toned lighting. A young man with long, wavy hair is seated in the foreground, wearing a dark school uniform blazer with a crest, a white shirt, and a patterned tie. In the background, a plain wall with a white baseboard is visible. To the left, the blue light from a laptop screen casts a glow, and to the right, the leg of a tripod stands on the floor. The overall color palette is muted, consisting of dark blues and greys.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
