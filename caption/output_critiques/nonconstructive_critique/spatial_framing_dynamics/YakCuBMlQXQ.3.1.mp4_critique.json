    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, the lower legs and feet of a person are framed from a low angle, level with the subject. The person starts in the center foreground and walks directly away from the camera, moving into the middle ground. The forest floor occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a tree stump visible in the right middle ground and several tree trunks positioned in the out-of-focus background. As the subject walks away, they decrease in size within the frame, receding into the forest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The lower halves of two individuals are visible, walking towards the camera. They are wearing dark, loose-fitting trousers and dark, sturdy boots. Their upper bodies and faces are not shown.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle shot captures the legs and feet of two individuals walking through a dim forest. Both are wearing dark pants and boots as they move towards the camera across the uneven terrain. The ground is covered with dark soil, pine needles, sparse green vegetation, and tree twigs. A tree stump is prominently visible in the middle ground, with the trunks of larger trees in the soft-focus background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

A tree stump is visible in the right middle ground, and several tree trunks are positioned in the out-of-focus background. As the subject moves across the frame, they maintain a consistent size, blending into the forest environment.",
