    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a city skyline at night from a high angle. The dark silhouettes of rooftops occupy the foreground across the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a line of illuminated buildings is positioned just above the rooftops. The background is dominated by a vast night sky filled with storm clouds, which fills the upper two-thirds of the frame. Bright flashes of lightning intermittently illuminate the clouds from within, concentrated in the upper-center and upper-left areas of the scene. A tall, lit skyscraper is visible in the distant background on the right side. The camera's position remains fixed throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot at night, dominated by a powerful thunderstorm. Brilliant flashes of purple and white lightning illuminate a large bank of clouds from within, creating a spectacular and turbulent display against the dark sky. Below the storm, the silhouette of rooftops occupies the foreground, while further in the distance, various buildings are brightly lit with yellow and white lights, establishing the urban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime view over a city captures a dramatic thunderstorm in progress. The dark sky is filled with large, purple-hued storm clouds that are intermittently and intensely illuminated from within by bright white and purple lightning. Below the turbulent sky, a cityscape is visible, with the dark silhouettes of residential rooftops in the foreground. In the mid-ground and distance, various buildings are lit with yellow and white lights, and a taller, distinct skyscraper can be seen on the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a city skyline at night. The dark silhouettes of rooftops stretch across the bottom of the frame. Above them, a line of illuminated buildings is visible. The night sky, filled with storm clouds, occupies a significant portion of the frame.

A tall, lit skyscraper stands in the distant background on the right side. The camera subtly pans throughout the shot, capturing the dynamic scene.",
