    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a group of people standing on a bridge, viewed from below. The subjects occupy the upper portion of the frame, leaning over a metal railing that spans horizontally across the middle ground. Their bodies are positioned along the top edge of the frame, with their heads and upper torsos visible. The group is spread out evenly from left to right, with some individuals gesturing or raising their hands. The \"NO BALL GAMES\" sign is located in the center-bottom of the frame, affixed to the railing in the foreground. The background consists of a cloudy sky and bare tree branches, indicating an outdoor urban setting. The camera remains stationary, capturing the scene from a low angle, emphasizing the elevated position of the subjects relative to the viewer. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a diverse group of people standing on a bridge, viewed from below. They are leaning over a metal railing, with some gesturing or holding up their hands. The group includes individuals wearing a variety of clothing, such as jackets and hoodies, in different colors like brown, blue, and black. The people have varied hairstyles and skin tones. A sign on the bridge reads \"NO BALL GAMES.\" The overall scene conveys a sense of casual gathering or interaction among the group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene from an objective point of view, focusing on a group of people standing on a concrete bridge or overpass. The setting is urban, with bare tree branches visible against a cloudy sky, suggesting a cool or overcast day. The bridge features a metal railing with vertical bars, and a sign reading \"NO BALL GAMES\" is prominently displayed. The individuals are casually dressed in various jackets and hoodies, leaning over the railing and engaging with the scene below. The environment conveys a sense of community interaction in a public space.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
