    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a standing woman occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, positioned above several seated figures in the foreground. Directly in front of her, a man is seated in the bottom center of the frame. To his left, another person sits in the bottom left, while a third figure is partially visible in the bottom right. The standing woman gesticulates by raising her hand, but the overall spatial composition of the subjects remains static. A prominent motion-blur effect creates hazy trails around the figures, slightly distorting their otherwise fixed positions within the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark room saturated with red and purple light, a woman with shoulder-length, wavy, light-colored hair stands over several seated people. She wears a light-colored robe with wide, padded sleeves and holds a white document in one hand while gesticulating with the other, raising it in the air. Seated directly in front of her is a man with short, dark hair and a receding hairline, wearing a collared shirt and gazing straight ahead. To his right sits another person with light-colored hair, and to his left, another figure is partially visible, slouched on a couch. The scene is hazy and has a motion-blur effect, obscuring fine details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a scene is bathed in a heavy, saturated red and purple light. A standing figure in a light-colored robe holds a white, square object while gesturing with one hand. Other figures are seated on a couch in the foreground, partially obscured by the darkness. The entire scene has a blurry, distorted quality, with a prominent ghosting or motion trail effect that creates a hazy and ethereal atmosphere. The background is indistinct, with only the vague shapes of furniture and walls visible through the intense, colored lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
