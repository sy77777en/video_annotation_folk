    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a vast waterscape. A long, narrow sandbar, positioned in the middle ground, extends from the bottom right of the frame diagonally toward the center. Numerous small boats are clustered along this sandbar and on a smaller, separate islet to its right. In the background, a distant landmass is visible across the top of the frame, situated below the overcast sky which occupies the upper third of the scene. The camera remains static, providing a fixed and expansive view of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a wide, high-angle landscape scenery shot of a vast and tranquil waterscape, likely at dawn or dusk. A long, narrow sandbar or peninsula juts out into the calm water, which reflects the soft pink and lavender tones of the overcast sky. Numerous small, dark fishing boats are moored along the edges of this sandbar, gathered around a small, rustic settlement. In the far distance, a hazy landmass with low mountains stretches across the horizon. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the expansive scale of the environment and the peaceful, atmospheric mood created by the soft light, rather than to focus on a particular object or action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive, calm body of water at either dawn or dusk. A long, narrow sandbar of light-brown earth extends into the water, hosting a small, dark-colored structure. Numerous long, dark boats are moored along the edges of this sandbar and on a separate, smaller islet nearby. The still water reflects the soft pink and grey tones of the overcast sky, and a hazy landmass is visible on the distant horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
