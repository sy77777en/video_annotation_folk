    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene, seated in a high-backed chair. A black cable is visible on the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground toward the middle ground. The surrounding dark environment and various wires occupy the background. The man, initially hunched over, slowly leans further forward and slightly to his right. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned adult man with dark, shaggy hair and some facial stubble is seated shirtless in a chair. He is hunched forward with his head slightly bowed. On his head, he wears a complex device made of wires and small, glowing lights. A band across his forehead features several red lights, while other lights positioned on top of his head glow blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a shirtless man is seated in a white, high-backed chair. He wears a complex headpiece constructed from a tangle of wires, which features glowing blue lights on top and a row of red lights across his forehead. Various black cables and wires are visible around the chair, connecting to the surrounding dark environment. The primary source of light comes from the headgear, illuminating the man's upper body and casting the rest of the scene in deep shadow. In the background, a red light and shadows cast through the window enhance the mysterious ambiance of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
