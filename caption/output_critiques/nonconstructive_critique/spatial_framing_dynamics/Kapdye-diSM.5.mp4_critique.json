    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot where a red Land Rover occupies the left half of the frame in the foreground. In the middle ground, a black Mercedes is positioned in the center-right, with other cars parked behind it. The camera, positioned at the vehicle's level, then moves backward and to the right, parallel to the Land Rover. This movement causes the shot to transition into a full shot, revealing the entire rear of the Land Rover, which now fills the center-left of the frame. As the camera continues its path, the Land Rover remains the primary foreground subject, while the background buildings on the right become more fully visible across the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red Land Rover Defender 90 with a white roof is shown on a street. The vehicle features a black roof rack, a black mesh grille over the rear side window, and black fender flares. A spare off-road tire on a white steel wheel is mounted on the rear door, next to a black access ladder. The vehicle has a yellow UK license plate reading \"R614 JGF,\" with the word \"Pooh\" written in white next to it and a small Union Jack flag sticker on the bottom right corner of the rear side of the car. Parked behind the Land Rover across the street is a black Mercedes-Benz B-Class station wagon with silver multi-spoke wheels. Behind the Mercedes is a silver sedan with a blue and white graphic on its rear side door. A white sedan is visible parked further down the street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along an urban street during the daytime. The camera walks alongside a red off-road vehicle with a white roof, a roof rack, a rear-mounted ladder, and a large spare tire. The vehicle remains in the frame the entire time, parked on the side of an asphalt road with white painted lines. Along the street, other cars, including a black Mercedes-Benz, are parked in front of tall, light-colored stone buildings with large windows. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"The Stradman\" in red and white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
