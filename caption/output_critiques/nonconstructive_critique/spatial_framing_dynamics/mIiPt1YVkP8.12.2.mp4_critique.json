    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of an airport scenery. An out-of-focus barbed-wire fence occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a prominent red and white radar tower is positioned in the center-right, with its rectangular antenna slowly rotating. To its left and further in the distance, a second, smaller tower is visible. The background is composed of a cityscape stretching across the frame, with a line of hazy hills visible at the top. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking across the airfield towards the distant city and hills.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an airport scenery shot captured with a muted, teal-toned color palette. In the foreground, a blurry barbed-wire fence separates the viewer from the airfield where a prominent red and white lattice radar tower stands, its long, rectangular antenna slowly rotating. Beyond the tower and an empty runway, a sprawling cityscape with another, smaller tower stretches towards a line of hazy, rolling hills under a pale, overcast sky. The composition emphasizes the overall environment and atmosphere, creating a sense of scale and place.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene at an airport is captured at dusk or on an overcast day, characterized by a cool, teal-toned color palette. In the foreground, a blurred chain-link fence with barbed wire on top separates the viewer from the airfield. The central focus is a tall, red-and-white lattice tower supporting a small cabin and a rotating rectangular radar antenna. In the background, a cityscape with various buildings is visible, nestled against a backdrop of hazy, rolling hills under a pale sky. Another, more distant tower can be seen to the left, along with some low-lying airport buildings and sparse trees.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
