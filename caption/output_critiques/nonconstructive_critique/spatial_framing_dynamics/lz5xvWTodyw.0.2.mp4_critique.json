    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, side-view shot of a 2D environment. Initially, a red character is positioned in the bottom center foreground, with an orange character on a small ledge in the middle ground, left of center. A large orange staircase structure occupies the left side of the frame, while orange, bowl-shaped platforms hang in the upper right and center-right. The red character jumps upwards and to the right as the orange character moves to hang from the center-right platform, extending a line that the red character catches. The red character then swings from this line and lands on another hanging platform to the left. The camera remains stationary at an eye-level perspective throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two simple, cartoon-like creatures with atypical appearances. One is a red, bean-shaped character with two short legs and two black dot eyes. The second creature is orange and has a more rectangular, blob-like body with rounded corners, two legs, and round eyes with black dots. Also visible are several flowers, each with six pink petals, six red petals, a yellow center, and a green stem. The scene includes orange, semi-circular platforms, each with a black ring hanging from a small black post underneath.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side captures a minimalist, abstract 2D world with an off-white background. The environment is composed of solid orange geometric shapes, including a floor, a staircase-like structure on the left, and various platforms. Several orange, bowl-shaped platforms with black hooks underneath hang from the top of the scene. On the ground level, three small flowers with pink petals and yellow centers are visible. A small red character jumps and swings from one of the hanging hooks to land on a platform, while an orange character moves between ledges. An instructional text overlay at the bottom of the screen reads, \"Press X while in the air to catch a hook,\" with the \"X\" depicted as a blue controller button icon.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
