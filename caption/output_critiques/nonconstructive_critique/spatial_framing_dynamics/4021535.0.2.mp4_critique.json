    "pre_caption": "In this static, extreme close-up, high-angle shot, a central pile of translucent sugar crystals and a dense swarm of small, reddish-brown ants are positioned in the center of the frame. The ants are in constant, multi-directional motion, crawling over and among the crystals within this central cluster. Additional scattered sugar crystals and individual ants extend from the main pile across the foreground, primarily towards the bottom, left, and right sides of the frame. The entire scene unfolds on a textured, blue-grey surface that serves as the immediate background for the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A multitude of small, reddish-brown ants with darker, almost black, abdomens are congregated on and around a pile of translucent, irregularly shaped, white sugar crystals. The ants, with visible legs and antennae, are actively moving over and among the sugar crystals, which are scattered on a textured, light blue-grey surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up shot, a cluster of small, reddish-brown ants with dark abdomens swarms over a pile of clear, crystalline sugar granules. The scene is set on a flat, blue-gray surface, possibly concrete, which prominently displays noticeable cracks and texture. The ants are actively moving among and over the translucent, irregularly shaped sugar crystals, which are scattered in and around a central pile.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
