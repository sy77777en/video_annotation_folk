    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, an aircraft is positioned in the left-middle ground, flying over brown hills that occupy the background along the bottom of the frame. A large cloud is situated in the right-middle ground, filling the upper right portion of the frame against a blue sky. The aircraft moves horizontally from its initial position toward the left edge of the frame. The camera remains static and is positioned below the aircraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A propeller-driven aircraft flies in the sky. The underside of the aircraft is white, while the top is red. The plane appears to be trailing something behind it, possibly a parachute, as it moves towards a large, white, and puffy cumulus cloud to its right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime scene set against a vast, clear blue sky, a uniquely designed aircraft flies over the tops of rolling brown hills. The aircraft features a long fuselage with a reddish-brown and white pattern, with reddish-brown on the top and white on the underside, and has two wings. Its bulbous nose, painted similarly to the rest of the aircraft, leads the way as it travels from right to left. The aircraft is flying away from a large, fluffy white cloud, which contrasts with the otherwise clear sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
