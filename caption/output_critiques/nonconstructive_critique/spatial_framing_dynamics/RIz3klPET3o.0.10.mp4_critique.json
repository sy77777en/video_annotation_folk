    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as an extreme wide shot from a side-on perspective. Initially, a cartoon character on a sled is positioned in the lower-left quadrant, situated on a curved black line in the middle ground. The number '40' is visible near the center, just below the character, with several dashes floating in the upper portion of the frame. The character slides down the line toward the bottom center. The scene then cuts, repositioning the character in the lower-left on a new, steeper line, with the number '42' and the letter 'f' now appearing in the upper-left quadrant. The character then slides down this new path, moving toward the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon character, rendered in a sketchy black-and-white style, is depicted in motion, sliding down the irregular, hand-drawn paths on a sled-like vehicle. The character wears a white helmet with a black outline. The scene includes several hand-drawn black lines, with the long, curved path emphasizing the character's movement. Other elements include short, floating black dashes, a curved line in the upper right, and the hand-drawn numbers \"40\" and \"42\", as well as the letter \"f\". The entire visual is presented in a minimalist, hand-drawn style.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video with a minimalist, hand-drawn aesthetic, the scene is set against a plain, light gray background. Several black, curved lines collectively form a track or slope. The number '40' is drawn next to a section of this track, while both short and long dashed lines appear in the upper and lower portions of the screen as the character slides downward.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
