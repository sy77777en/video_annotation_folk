    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of the subjects, capturing all four individuals in the room. Initially, the man in the yellow sweater and dark pants is positioned near the center-right of the frame, slightly in the foreground. The woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue and white checkered dress, is on the left side, also in the foreground. The child in a patterned suit and red hat is seated on the sofa in the background, towards the left. The woman with a towel on her head and a white robe is behind the man in the yellow sweater, closer to the center. As the video progresses, the shot size changes to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the central action. The man in the yellow sweater moves slightly to the right, maintaining his position in the foreground. The blonde woman shifts towards the center, still in the foreground. The child remains seated on the sofa in the background, while the woman in the robe moves closer to the man in the yellow sweater, staying in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, providing a consistent perspective. The sofa with the patterned blanket and the floor lamp with an orange shade are consistently visible in the background, along with the wood-paneled walls and brick fireplace",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people in a room with wood-paneled walls and a brick fireplace. There are four people including a man in a yellow sweater and dark pants. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue and white checkered dress. A child in a suit with many patterns and  wearing a red hat. Another woman with a towel wrapped around her head and a white robe is visible. All four individuals are moving in a panicked manner. The setting includes a sofa with a patterned blanket and a floor lamp with an orange shade.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a cozy, rustic living room. The environment features wood-paneled walls and a brick fireplace, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. Natural light floods the room, suggesting it is daytime, while two floor lamps provide additional soft, orange glows that complement the earthy tones of the decor. A light-colored sofa with a blue-green plaid blanket draped over it adds to the homely feel. A round wooden table enhances the casual, lived-in environment. A painting hangs on the wall above the sofa, contributing to the room's aesthetic. The scene includes movement, with individuals interacting dynamically within the space, enhancing the lively ambiance. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The position of the woman in the blue and white checkered dress is misstated. The description of the child's action and location is wrong; the child is not seated on the sofa. The caption incorrectly states that the woman in the robe is present at the beginning of the video and fails to mention her entrance. The description of the subjects' movement is inaccurate, failing to describe the primary movement towards the camera and the resulting changes in the subjects' visibility, depth, and framing. The caption is also missing some background elements and their specific locations.",
