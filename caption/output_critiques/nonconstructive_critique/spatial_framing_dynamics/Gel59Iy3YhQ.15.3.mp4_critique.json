    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high, top-down angle, showing four static characters in a room. In the center middle ground, a male character stands with his back to the camera. In front of him, at the top center of the frame, a female character stands behind a long table in the middle ground. To the bottom right, two other characters stand together in the middle ground. The room's furniture includes the central table, a bookshelf in the top background, and a lamp on the right. Numerous small, white paper rabbits are scattered across the floor and table in the middle ground. A semi-transparent dialogue box is overlaid in the center foreground, and its text changes once during the clip. A HUD is visible at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel art scene, four characters are present in a room filled with small, white, paper-like rabbits. In the center, a man with brown hair, wearing a brown shirt and green pants, stands with his back to the viewer. In front of him, a woman with long, reddish-brown hair in a purple dress stands behind a long wooden table, which is covered in the paper rabbits. On the table next to her is a brown stuffed platypus. To the right of the room, a man with light brown hair and a woman with light blue hair stand together, both dressed in white lab coats. A dialogue box is present, showing a conversation between characters named \"John\" and \"River.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with an oblique top-down view shows an indoor scene in a dimly lit room with dark teal carpeting and light brown wood-paneled walls. The room is furnished with a large wooden table in the center, a bookshelf filled with red and green books against the back wall, a potted plant, and a side table. Numerous small, white, paper-like rabbits are scattered across the floor, and several pixel-art characters are present in the room. A semi-transparent dialogue box overlay appears in the center, displaying text that changes from \"John: What are ya making there?\" to \"River: Rabbits.\" At the bottom of the screen, a HUD features a blue bar and five colored circular icons. A floor lamp is also visible in the room.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
