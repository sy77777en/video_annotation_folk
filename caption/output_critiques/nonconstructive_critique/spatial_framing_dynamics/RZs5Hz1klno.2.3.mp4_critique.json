    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a USB drive is initially positioned in the top-center of the frame and the middle ground, hanging vertically above an electronic device. The device occupies the bottom half of the frame, situated in the foreground and middle ground, with its USB ports visible in the center. A dark, out-of-focus area forms the background. The USB drive then moves straight down from the top-center and inserts into a port. As this happens, the camera moves slightly forward, tightening the frame so that the inserted drive becomes more prominent in the center. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the entire shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a dark gray, matte-finished USB drive being inserted vertically into a port. The drive's silver metal connector has a white plastic interior with visible red contacts. It is lowered into a USB-A port, which is one of a series of rectangular slots on the top surface of a light gray electronic device. The device itself has a dark gray trim along its edge. The action concludes with the USB drive fully inserted into the port.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a black USB drive with a metal connector is lowered and inserted into a USB port on a white and dark gray electronic device. The port is one of several slots on the top surface of the machine. The background is dark and out of focus. A small white overlay displays \"[2]\" in the lower left corner of the screen.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows the process of a USB drive being inserted into a port. Initially, the USB drive occupies 50% of the frame’s height and is partially visible at the top of the frame. As the camera moves forward, the USB drive is inserted into the port, with about half of the USB drive visible, occupying 60% of the frame's height.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
