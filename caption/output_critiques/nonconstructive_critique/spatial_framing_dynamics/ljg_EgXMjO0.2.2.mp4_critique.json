    "pre_caption": "In a black-and-white animation viewed from a high angle, a very long, stylized dog is positioned diagonally in the middle ground, stretching from the top right towards the bottom left. A large pair of scissors descends from the top of the frame into the middle ground to cut the dog's body. After each cut, the front segment becomes a new, complete dog that continues moving towards the bottom left foreground, while the rear segment regenerates a head and remains an elongated dog in the middle ground. The scissors repeatedly ascend to the top of the frame and descend to cut the dog again, creating a continuous procession of new dogs that move from the middle ground towards the bottom left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a cartoonish, dachshund-like dog with an extremely elongated body and short legs is shown. A large pair of scissors, also drawn in a pencil sketch style, repeatedly descends from the top of the scene to cut the long dog's body. Each time the scissors snip, the front segment of the dog develops two hind legs and a tail, forming a complete dog, while the rear segment regenerates a head and two front legs, creating another complete dog. The rear body appears to extend indefinitely, only to be cut by the scissors again. This cycle repeats, with all the newly formed dogs continuing to move forward in the original direction.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black-and-white, hand-drawn animation set against a plain white background, a very long, stylized dachshund-like dog moves across the scene. From above, a large pair of scissors, also hand-drawn, descends and repeatedly snips the dog's elongated body. With each cut, the severed front portion transforms into a new, complete dog, while the rear portion regenerates a head and front legs, becoming another elongated dog. This cycle repeats continuously as the scissors keep descending, consistently creating new dogs, all of which proceed in the original direction.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
