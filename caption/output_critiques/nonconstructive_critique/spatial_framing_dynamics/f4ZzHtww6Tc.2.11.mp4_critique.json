    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a low perspective, showing a person on a skateboard in the middle ground at the top right and another individual walking up stairs in the center middle ground. A second skateboarder enters from the left foreground, riding along a low concrete ledge toward the center. As he reaches the center foreground, he jumps off the ledge onto the brick pavement below. He then skates away from the camera, moving into the left middle ground and receding into the distance. The camera's position remains static throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with tattoos on his arms is skateboarding in an urban plaza. He wears a white t-shirt with a blue graphic on the front, dark blue cuffed jeans, white sneakers, and a blue baseball cap worn backward. Another individual in the middle ground, dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, passed by and glanced briefly.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level perspective on a brick-paved plaza, the scene captures a wide set of shallow concrete stairs. Beside the stairs stands a large, abstract metal sculpture with sail-like components, set against a backdrop of modern city skyscrapers and green trees under a bright, clear sky. The plaza is paved with a pattern of red and brown bricks alongside concrete walkways. A person on a skateboard is visible descending the stairs on the right and also skateboarding in the open area to the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
