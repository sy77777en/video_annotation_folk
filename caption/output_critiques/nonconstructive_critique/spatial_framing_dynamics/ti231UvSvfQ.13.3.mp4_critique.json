    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a man positioned in the left foreground, his head resting on a surface. His hand is visible in the center-right foreground. He then lifts his head, which remains in the left half of the frame, and turns to look toward the right side of the scene. In the out-of-focus background, a vertical white light is situated in the upper-right quadrant. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, a young, fair-skinned man with short, light-colored hair is shown in a close-up. He appears to be wearing a sweatshirt, though the color is hard to discern due to the lighting. On his left wrist, he has an object that resembles a bracelet, but it is not clearly identifiable against the blurred background. Initially seen with his head down on a surface, he lifts his head to look towards the right, his eyes wide and his mouth slightly open. His face is partially obscured by shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a dimly lit indoor setting, likely at night, with a desaturated, almost monochromatic color scheme and deep shadows. In the foreground, a surface resembling a desk is faintly visible, blending into the darkness. The background is out of focus, featuring the silhouette of electronic equipment and a single, narrow vertical white light.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a black screen and transitions to a close-up of a man lying face down on a table, then lifting his head.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
