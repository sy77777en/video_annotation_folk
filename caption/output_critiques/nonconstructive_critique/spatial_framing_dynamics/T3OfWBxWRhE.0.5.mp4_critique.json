    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a London cityscape, focusing on the scenery. The Elizabeth Tower is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with the Palace of Westminster extending across the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground. A blurred lamppost occupies the bottom-left foreground. To the right, another large building is situated in the middle ground, with two red buses in motion at the bottom right. The sky fills the top of the frame in the background. The camera, positioned at a low angle looking up at the architecture, moves forward and slightly to the right, causing the foreground lamppost to pan from the left toward the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic cityscape scenery shot of London, centered on the iconic Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben. The tall clock tower stands prominently against a moody, teal-colored sky filled with streaked, fast-moving clouds. To the left, the ornate Gothic architecture of the Palace of Westminster extends into the frame, while on the right, blurred red double-decker buses suggest the constant motion of city traffic. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on capturing the grand scale and atmospheric quality of the environment, using the famous landmarks to establish a powerful sense of place.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene in London features the Elizabeth Tower, also known as Big Ben, and the Palace of Westminster under a dramatic, overcast sky with fast-moving, teal-tinted clouds. The ornate, light-colored stone buildings in the Gothic Revival style occupy the left and center of the view, with some scaffolding visible at the base of the clock tower. To the right is another large building, and on the street below, two red double-decker buses are visible in motion. A lamppost, initially in the middle ground, moves towards the camera, transitioning into the foreground before disappearing out of the frame on the left side. The overall scene has a sense of movement, as if viewed from a moving vehicle.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
