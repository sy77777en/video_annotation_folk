    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a woman is initially positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, with her head and shoulders visible. She is looking towards the right side of the frame. In the background, a wall with a light switch is visible on the left, while indistinct elements occupy the right background. The woman then begins to stand, causing her upper body to move downwards and partially out of the frame. The framing adjusts slightly lower, bringing her brown jacket into focus, occupying the center and right portions of the frame in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a loose bun. She is wearing a brown jacket over a blue shirt. Her expression appears focused as she looks to her right. The video captures her in a seated position initially, and then she begins to stand up, with the focus shifting to her jacket as she moves. The setting is dimly lit, emphasizing her profile and clothing details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set inside a dimly lit room. A woman with brown hair tied back is visible, wearing a blue collared shirt beneath a brown canvas jacket. A wall with a light switch can be seen in the background. As the woman stands up, the lower part of the brown jacket comes into closer view, revealing a pocket detail and a small, square logo patch.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
