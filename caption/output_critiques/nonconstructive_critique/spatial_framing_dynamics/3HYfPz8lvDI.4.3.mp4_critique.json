    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot, captured from a high-angle perspective, looking down into an open, light brown cardboard box that occupies the majority of the frame. Positioned in the center of the box and the frame, in the middle ground, is a stack of white papers. The top paper, a news article, is the central focus. Its title, \"London's Walkie Talkie judged UK's worst building,\" is at the top center of the paper. Below the title, on the top left of the paper, are the date and comment count, with a small red icon situated further below them. A large color photograph is centrally located on the paper, in the middle ground of the article itself, depicting the London skyline; the Walkie Talkie building is prominent within this photo, slightly left of its center, while the River Thames is at the bottom of the photo. The byline \"THOMAS LANE\" is in the bottom left corner of this photograph. The article text is printed in columns below the photograph, occupying the bottom portion of the paper. An overlay with white text is consistently visible in the bottom left corner of the frame, in the foreground. The scene remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows an open, light brown cardboard box containing a stack of white papers. The top paper is a printed news article titled \"London's Walkie Talkie judged UK's worst building\" in a large, bold black font. A small red square icon is positioned just below the left side of the title. Positioned between the icon and the headline, the date \"2 September 2015\" and \"386 Comments\" are visible in smaller black text. A color photograph dominates the center of the article, depicting the London skyline under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. Prominently featured in the photograph is the curved, glass-facaded Walkie Talkie building (20 Fenchurch Street), alongside other skyscrapers, including the Gherkin (30 St Mary Axe), with the River Thames in the foreground. The byline \"THOMAS LANE\" is printed in a black text box, prominently displayed in the lower-left corner of the photo as the author’s credit. Below the photograph, the article text is printed in black columns.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a stack of white paper documents inside a light brown cardboard box. The top document is a printed article titled \"London's Walkie Talkie judged UK's worst building\" in bold black font. Below the title, there is a date, \"2 September 2015,\" and \"386 Comments.\" Below the date, a red square icon featuring a white arrow-like symbol is visible. The article features a color photograph of the London skyline, showcasing several modern skyscrapers, including the distinctive \"Walkie Talkie\" building, against a clear blue sky with a few wispy clouds. The River Thames is visible in the foreground with a boat. The text of the article is printed in black. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays white text: \"[19] - BBC - London's Walkie Talkie judged UK's worst building (2015)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
