    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of two men descending a staircase, occupying the bottom third of the frame. The camera is positioned above them, capturing the rough, textured stone walls on either side, which are in the middle ground. As they move downwards, the camera follows, transitioning to their level. The men are initially in the bottom center of the frame, with the staircase leading to a large, metallic door in the background. As they approach the door, the camera maintains a medium shot, with the men now positioned more centrally. The door, featuring geometric patterns and red stars, becomes the focal point in the background. The camera's height adjusts to match the men's level as they reach the door, emphasizing the transition from an outdoor to an indoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men descending a staircase in an ancient architectural setting. The man on the left wears an orange shirt and a blue backpack, while the man on the right is dressed in a blue and white jacket. Initially seen from behind, they approach a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars. The setting emphasizes the stone walls and the architectural details surrounding the men as they move towards the door.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, descending into an underground setting. The environment is outdoors initially. The scene begins with a view of a concrete staircase flanked by rough, textured stone walls leading downwards. The time of day appears to be bright, likely midday, as natural light illuminates the scene. The concrete walls are weathered, with visible cracks and patches of moss, indicating age and exposure to the elements. As the descent continues, the setting shifts to an interior space with a large, metallic door at the bottom, featuring geometric patterns and red star markings. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that enhance the enclosed, bunker-like atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a sense of exploration into a hidden or restricted area.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from a first-person view in an ancient architectural setting. The camera follows two men from behind as they descend a staircase and approach a gray door. The shot shows a medium view of the two men, occupying the bottom third of the frame, leaving more content for the surrounding scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
