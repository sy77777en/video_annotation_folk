    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a person on a dirt bike is initially positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the middle ground of a steep, grassy hill, with the camera positioned above them. A town is visible in the background at the top of the frame, and a dense thicket of trees occupies the middle ground on the right. The rider accelerates up the hill, moving toward the center and then to the right side of the frame. As the rider ascends, the camera pans right and tilts up to follow their movement. This action causes the rider to move from a position below the camera to one above it, shifting the camera's relative height to be below the subject. During this transition, the town in the background moves out of the frame, which then shows the hillside in the foreground and middle ground, with a line of trees and the sky in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is riding an orange and white dirt bike. The rider is wearing a white helmet with blue and red accents, a red and black long-sleeved top, gray and orange pants, and black boots.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on a steep, grassy hillside during the day. The terrain is rugged, covered in a mix of green and brown grass, scattered rocks, and small yellow wildflowers. Initially, a dense thicket of green trees and bushes lines the right side of the slope. In the first part of the video, a town with red-roofed houses is visible in a valley below, but it disappears from view as the camera pans. The sky is overcast with some clouds. A person on an orange and white dirt bike ascends the hill, kicking up a trail of dust as they move up the incline and across the landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to below the subject.",
