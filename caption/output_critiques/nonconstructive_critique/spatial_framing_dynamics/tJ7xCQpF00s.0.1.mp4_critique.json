    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of two people under an umbrella crossing a wet city street at night. Initially, they are positioned near the center of the frame, moving from the foreground towards the middle ground. As they walk, their 2D position shifts slightly to the left, maintaining a central alignment in the frame. The umbrella, with its distinctive white and black pattern, is prominently featured above them. The streetlights and car headlights in the background illuminate the scene, casting reflections on the wet pavement. The buildings line both sides of the street, occupying the left and right edges of the frame, creating a sense of depth. The camera remains at eye level with the subjects, capturing their movement across the crosswalk. The vehicles with headlights appear in the background, enhancing the urban setting. The overall spatial framing emphasizes the contrast between the silhouetted figures and the glowing lights, with minimal changes in shot size or camera angle throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a city street scene during a rainy evening. The main subjects are two people under an umbrella with an alternating pattern of white and black colors, walking across a wet crosswalk. They are dressed in dark clothing. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the wet pavement reflects the glow of streetlights and headlights from approaching cars. The scene captures the interplay of light and shadow, with the umbrella and the people standing out against the dimly lit surroundings. The presence of vehicles with illuminated headlights adds a dynamic element, emphasizing the urban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dimly lit urban street scene during a rainy evening. The setting is outdoors, featuring a wide street flanked by tall, dark buildings that create a canyon-like effect. The wet pavement reflects the glow of streetlights and headlights, adding a shimmering quality to the scene. Vehicles with illuminated headlights move along the street, while pedestrians holding umbrellas cross at the intersection, their silhouettes outlined against the reflective surface. The atmosphere is moody, with the rain creating a glossy texture on the road and sidewalks. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones and the soft glow of artificial lights.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
