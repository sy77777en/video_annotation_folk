    "pre_caption": "A static, wide shot frames the scene from a high-angle, isometric perspective. The main subject, a small aircraft, begins in the bottom left foreground and moves through a maze that occupies the center of the frame. The maze is bordered by a tall wall in the top left background and a shorter wall in the bottom left foreground, with various obstacles positioned in the middle ground. The user interface elements are fixed around the gameplay area: scores are at the top center, an altitude meter is on the left, a fuel gauge is at the bottom center, and an enemy counter is in the bottom right. As the aircraft navigates the maze, explosions appear in the middle ground. The camera's position remains unchanged throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a retro arcade game with a distinct isometric, pixel-art aesthetic. The player's craft is a small, triangular aircraft with an orange body, yellow wings, and pink tail fins. The game's interface features a score displayed in a white pixelated font at the top, a horizontal orange bar representing a fuel gauge at the bottom center, and an enemy plane counter at the bottom right. On the left side of the play area, a vertical meter marked with \"H\" and \"L\" indicates altitude. Within the game world, red-and-white striped barrels and other abstract gray obstacles are positioned on a dark blue, maze-like floor, which is bordered by gray brick walls. Explosions are rendered as yellow and red starbursts, while the bullets fired by the aircraft are depicted as short green lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows a maze-like environment from a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set within a structure with light blue and gray walls, some of which have a brick texture. The floor is dark blue, marked with a grid of lighter blue lines that form a labyrinthine path. Scattered throughout the maze are red-and-white striped barrels, gray, pipe-like obstacles, and small, dark craters on the floor. A small, yellow and pink aircraft navigates the corridors, and at times, bright yellow and red explosions erupt on the floor. The scene includes a heads-up display with several overlays. At the top, a \"TOP\" score and a \"1UP\" score are displayed. On the bottom left, a \"FUEL\" gauge and aircraft icons are visible. The bottom right shows \"ENEMY PLANE = 00\", and the bottom center displays \"© SEGA 1982\". A vertical bar labeled \"H\" and \"L\" is on the left side of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
