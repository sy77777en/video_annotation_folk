    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, three young men are positioned in the middle ground of a tiled underpass, with a row of fluorescent lights visible at the top of the frame in the background. Initially, one man stands on the left side of the frame, and another leans against the back wall in the center-left. The main subject, a man on a bicycle, is positioned on the center-right. He then rides the bicycle slightly forward, moving from the center-right to the center of the frame, while the other two subjects remain stationary on the left. The camera is static and positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video centers on a young man with medium skin tone, short dark hair, who is wearing a white hoodie and light gray sweatpants while leaning against a tiled wall with one leg bent and his hands in his pockets. To his right stands another young man with a darker skin tone, dressed in a bright orange and black patterned hooded jacket with the hood up and black pants, facing the first young man. A third young man, with dark skin and wearing a beanie, is riding a black bicycle; he wears a red, white, and dark striped short-sleeve shirt and dark blue jeans. The man on the bicycle approaches and faces away from the two standing men, toward the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a tiled underpass, the scene is illuminated by a row of long, rectangular fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a cool, greenish glow. The walls are composed of light-colored, rectangular tiles, and the ground appears light in color. Three young men are positioned in the underpass. One man sits on a dark-colored electric bicycle equipped with a basket on the front, while two others stand against the tiled wall behind him. The man on the bicycle moves to the center during the middle of the video, while the other two remain mostly still against the wall. The scene is illuminated by a row of long, rectangular fluorescent lights on the ceiling, and there are also outdoor light sources at both ends of the underpass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
