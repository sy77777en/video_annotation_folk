    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up, low-angle shot filmed at the subject's level. In the bottom right foreground, the silhouette of a person's lower leg and bare foot is visible on the sand. The person moves from the right side of the frame toward the left, passing in front of the fire. A large bonfire is positioned in the center-left middle ground. The background, visible behind the fire, consists of a body of water and a distant landmass.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, visible only as a dark silhouette from the leg down, stands barefoot on sand in the foreground. Behind the legs of the person in the middleground and slightly to the left of the frame, a large bonfire burns brightly, constructed from logs arranged in a teepee-like structure. The intense orange and yellow flames illuminate the sand around the base of the fire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night on a sandy beach, a large bonfire burns brightly, its orange and yellow flames illuminating the immediate area. The fire is constructed from numerous branches and twigs arranged in a tall, conical pile. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of a person's bare feet and lower legs move across the sand, passing close to the fire. In the background, a dark body of water stretches towards a distant, silhouetted landmass under a dark sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
