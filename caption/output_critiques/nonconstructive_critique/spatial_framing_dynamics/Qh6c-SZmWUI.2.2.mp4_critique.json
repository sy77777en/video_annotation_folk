    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. The scene begins as a wide shot from within a dark, narrow passageway, with the camera moving backward. An arched opening, centered in the frame, acts as a foreground element, framing the sunlit exterior in the middle ground. The camera rapidly pulls back through the opening, transitioning the view into an extreme wide shot. In this final composition, a large, ivy-covered stone building on a cliff occupies the center-right middle ground. The ocean is visible in the left background, while dense green foliage fills the foreground and right side of the frame. The camera continues to move backward and slightly upward, revealing the full scale of the cliffside structure, positioning the camera at a high angle relative to the sea and the base of the cliff.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an impressive drone shot that enhances the epic quality of the landscape scenery. It begins with a backward flight through a dark, narrow passageway, seamlessly transitioning to an illuminated exit. This smooth movement suggests a journey or discovery, leading to a bright, expansive view of a cliffside adorned with a building covered in lush greenery. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the contrast between the enclosed, shadowy tunnel and the open, vibrant landscape, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the natural surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, begins by flying backward through a dimly lit, narrow tunnel with an arched entrance, gradually revealing more detail in the stone walls and floor. As the drone exits the tunnel, a vibrant glimpse of greenery emerges, transitioning to a bright, expansive outdoor scene. The setting shifts to a coastal landscape featuring a historic stone building perched on a cliff, partially covered in lush green ivy, with a terracotta roof contrasting against the clear blue sky. The surrounding area includes dense vegetation and a view of the ocean, with sunlight casting sharp shadows that highlight the natural textures of the stone and foliage. The time of day appears to be midday, with clear weather and scattered clouds enhancing the vibrant colors of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
