    "pre_caption": "The video uses a medium shot, framing the main subjects from about the waist up. In the first scene, the woman with the maroon necklace stands in the right foreground, occupying the bottom right and center of the frame, while a small white table with a vase of flowers, a framed portrait, and a plate of cake is positioned in the left foreground. The older man in a green suit is in the middle ground, initially centered but shifting left as the camera moves. Another woman, reading, is in the background on the left side, and white chairs line the back wall. In the next scene, the woman and a man in a black suit stand side by side in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame, both holding plates of food. Several other figures are visible in the background, spaced across the width of the frame and positioned further from the camera. The camera remains at the subjects’ eye level throughout, and the spatial arrangement emphasizes the foreground subjects while maintaining clear separation from the background elements. The only notable movement is the older man’s gradual shift to the left and the woman taking the plate of cake from the table.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several stylized claymation figures with exaggerated facial features and elongated heads. The most prominent subject is a woman with pale skin, short brown hair with bangs, and a maroon beaded necklace, wearing a dark blue dress with a diamond pattern; she holds a small plate of food and has a serious expression. A man with light skin, short brown hair, and a somber face, dressed in a black suit and white shirt, stands beside her, also holding a plate of food. In the background, another woman with short dark hair and a dark dress is seen reading. An older man with a bald head and gray hair on the sides, wearing a green suit, initially positioned at the center, gradually shifts to the left as the camera moves. A framed portrait of a man with a long face and blue shirt, along with a vase of white flowers, is placed on a table. The small plate with a slice of cake and a candle beside the portrait is soon taken by the prominent woman, suggesting a commemorative setting. The characters’ faces are marked by visible brushstrokes and blush, giving them a handcrafted, textured appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a softly lit room with muted blue walls and a parquet floor, giving the environment a subdued atmosphere. In the foreground, a small white table holds a vase of white flowers with green stems and leaves, a gold-framed portrait of a person with pale skin and dark eyes, and a small plate with a slice of cake and a red candle. Several figures with stylized, elongated heads and painted facial features are present, dressed in dark, formal clothing. The room contains white chairs with dark frames arranged along the walls, and the overall scene is calm, with no visible movement or dramatic changes in lighting. There are no overlays or on-screen text elements present. The slice of cake on the white table is soon taken by the woman in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
