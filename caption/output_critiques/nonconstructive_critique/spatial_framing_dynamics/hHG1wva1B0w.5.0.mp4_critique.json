    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a red figure lies on the ground in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A translucent blue figure stands over it, also located in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The scene is illuminated by a spotlight from above, casting a cone of light onto the figures. A white dashed line is visible in the bottom left, and a yellow solid line is in the bottom right. The shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark setting illuminated by a single spotlight from above, a solid red, featureless, mannequin-like figure lies on its side on a paved surface. Its legs are bent, and its arms are positioned in front of its torso. Standing over the red figure is a solid blue, featureless, mannequin-like figure, with its arms bent in front of its torso, as if it is catching or interacting with the red figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a scene is captured at night on a dark asphalt surface, possibly a road or parking lot. A single, bright spotlight from above illuminates a section of the flat road, leaving the surroundings in complete darkness. Within the light, a solid red, featureless mannequin lies on the ground. A second, hazy blue mannequin stands over it. The ground within the illuminated area shows a dashed white line and a solid yellow line.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
