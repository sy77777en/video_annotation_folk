    "pre_caption": "This medium-long shot centers on a snowboarder in the foreground, captured from their own perspective at their level. As the snowboarder moves, the camera moves with them, keeping them centered in the frame. A large plume of snow is kicked up, occupying the right side of the frame and flying toward the camera in the immediate foreground. In the background, a snow-covered mountain is positioned in the top left, while the sun is located in the top right. A second person on a snowboard is visible in the right middle ground, and as the main subject descends, the background elements shift from right to left across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man snowboarding, seen from a full shot as he looks toward the camera. He wears a black and grey patterned snow jacket with the hood pushed up by his backpack, a pink beanie, black snow pants, black gloves, and a black backpack. His face is partially covered by large ski goggles with orange-tinted lenses, and his mouth is open. He is passing through a large spray of snow. In the middleground, another person is visible on a snowboard, also moving through the snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot captures a person snowboarding down a vast, snow-covered mountain. The scene is set during the daytime under a clear blue sky, with the bright sun visible. In the background, rocky peaks emerge from the deep snow. As the snowboarder moves, they kick up a large plume of white powder snow, which billows around them. Another person on a snowboard is briefly visible further up the slope.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
