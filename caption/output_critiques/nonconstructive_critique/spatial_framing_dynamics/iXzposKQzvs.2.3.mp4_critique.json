    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a woman sitting in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. She is positioned on a grey mat that occupies the bottom center foreground. A purple water bottle is in the middle ground to her left, and a black backpack is in the middle ground to her right. A smartphone rests on the mat in front of her. In the background, a blue curtain hangs behind her, with a silver metal structure visible on the right side of the frame. The woman initially holds the water bottle, then places it down and brings her hands together to form a heart shape over her chest. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young woman with blonde hair pulled back is sitting on the floor on a grey mat that has \"USA\" printed in large white letters. She is wearing a dark blue zip-up jacket with an American flag patch on the right side of her chest, matching dark blue pants, and fuzzy socks designed with two color blocks: pink and gray. She has large, white over-ear headphones on. Initially, she holds a purple water bottle and smiles at the camera. She then puts the bottle down and makes a heart shape with her hands over her chest, continuing to smile. A smartphone is on the mat between her legs, and a black backpack with straps that have a black base and red edges sits on the floor behind her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor athletic setting features a bright blue carpet, partially covered by a grey mat with the word \"USA\" in large, white block letters. A dark blue curtain hangs in the background, and to the right, a silver metal bar structure is visible. A woman sits with a purple water bottle resting in her lap, and next to the mat on the left is a pink towel. On the right, a black backpack with a black base and red edges on the straps is placed on the floor. A smartphone is also placed on the grey mat.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
