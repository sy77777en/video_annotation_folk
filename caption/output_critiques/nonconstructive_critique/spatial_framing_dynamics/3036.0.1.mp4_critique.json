    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a woman, with her upper body and head partially visible on the right side of the frame. She is positioned in the foreground, facing away from the camera. Her long, straight hair and light-colored garment are visible. The camera captures her from an over-the-shoulder perspective, placing her slightly off-center to the right. In the background, technical equipment is visible, including two bright light sources positioned centrally in the middle ground, which create a silhouette effect around the woman. The text \"OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING\" is overlaid in the lower left corner of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent angle and distance. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects and elements within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with long, straight hair, partially visible on the right side as she faces away from the camera. She is wearing a light-colored garment. The lighting is dim, with a bright light source in front of her, creating a silhouette effect. The setting appears to be a studio environment, with equipment visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with an over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character, capturing a portion of their upper body from the left side of the frame and the scene ahead. The environment is dimly lit, suggesting a controlled lighting setup, possibly in a studio or a similar space. The background features technical equipment, including a visible light source that emits a bright glow, creating a contrast against the darker surroundings. The scene is characterized by a focus on technology, with the presence of projection equipment. The time of day is indeterminate due to the indoor setting and artificial lighting. Overlay elements include the text \"OMOTE REAL-TIME FACE TRACKING & PROJECTION MAPPING\" prominently displayed in the lower left corner, providing context for the scene without being part of the physical environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
