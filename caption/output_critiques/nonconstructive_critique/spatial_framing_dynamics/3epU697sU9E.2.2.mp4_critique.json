    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures Air Force One positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. The aircraft is angled with its nose pointing toward the left side of the frame. It rests on a dark gray ground plane that extends from the foreground to the middle ground. The background is entirely black. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features Air Force One, a large aircraft with a distinctive design. The top half of the plane is white, while the bottom half is light blue, with a darker blue stripe running along the middle. The nose of the plane is painted in the darker blue color. It has four engines, two on each wing, and a prominent tail fin. The cockpit windows are visible, and the landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground. The plane has a sleek, streamlined shape, and there is a red light located at the bottom of the fuselage. The overall appearance suggests a modern, well-maintained aircraft.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A Boeing 747, painted in the livery of Air Force One, is stationary on a dark gray, featureless ground plane. The background is completely black, creating a stark, isolated setting. The aircraft's fuselage is white on top and light blue on the bottom, with \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" printed along its side, an American flag on the tail, and the presidential seal near the nose. The plane's landing gear is deployed, and small red lights are visible on the aircraft's body and wingtips. The scene is evenly lit, highlighting the plane against the dark surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
