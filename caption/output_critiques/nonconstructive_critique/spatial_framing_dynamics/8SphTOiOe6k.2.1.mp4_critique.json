    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene. The street is positioned in the foreground, with traditional wooden buildings lining the left side of the frame, extending into the middle ground. A stone-paved sidewalk runs along the right side, where a small group of people is visible, adding a sense of activity. The camera is at street level, providing a first-person perspective. In the background, a bus is seen in the distance, enhancing the urban setting. A lush green tree and a stone bridge are located on the right, contributing to the natural charm. As the camera pans right, it transitions to focus on a large wooden-framed sign in the foreground, which displays a vibrant landscape image. This sign becomes the central point of interest, positioned centrally in the frame, with the camera at eye level to the sign. The transition from the street scene to the sign shifts the viewer's focus from the broader environment to a specific cultural element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a wide shot of a bustling street scene. As the camera pans, it shifts focus to a large, eye-catching sign framed in wood. This sign, featuring a vibrant image of a lush landscape with a clear sky, mountains, and greenery, becomes the central point of interest, drawing the viewer's attention with its serene and colorful composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing a serene outdoor setting in a quaint town. The scene unfolds during the day under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. The environment features a street lined with traditional wooden buildings, some with red accents, and a stone-paved sidewalk. A small group of people is visible, walking along the street and sidewalk, adding a sense of quiet activity. A bus is seen in the distance, suggesting a functional urban area. On one side, a lush green tree and a stone bridge over a narrow waterway enhance the natural charm. A wooden signboard displays a vibrant image of a picturesque landscape, contributing to the cultural ambiance. The overall atmosphere is calm and inviting, with a blend of natural and architectural elements.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a wide shot of a street scene with some people. The camera then pans right to focus on a sign with a scenery picture.",
