    "pre_caption": "This medium shot centers on three men positioned in the middle ground. The main subject is in the center, with a policeman to his left and a security guard to his right. Both the policeman and the security guard are static, holding transparent revolvers aimed forward in the middle ground. Numerous kitchen items, such as plates and cutlery, are suspended motionless throughout the middle ground and background. The main subject moves fluidly within the central space, interacting with the frozen figures by adjusting their arms and redirecting their revolvers towards one another. The background features kitchen shelves and equipment. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three individuals in a room resembling a kitchen, surrounded by objects like knives, plates, and water droplets suspended in mid-air. Initially, the man on the far left is wearing a silver jacket over a black t-shirt, dark pants, sunglasses, and has headphones around his neck. He moves to the right side and eventually returns to the center of the frame. In the middle is a man in a dark police uniform, complete with a peaked cap, holding a silver revolver. On the right is a man in a security guard uniform, consisting of a white short-sleeved shirt, black tie, and black cap, also holding a silver revolver. In the end, the man in the silver jacket is actively interacting with the two uniformed men, manipulating their arms and aim.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors within a kitchen environment, characterized by stainless steel counters and what appear to be tiled walls. Numerous metallic kitchen utensils, predominantly knives, are suspended in mid-air, alongside visible water droplets, creating the effect of arrested motion. Stacks of white cups and white plates are visible on the counters. The overall scene has a cool, blue-grey metallic color tone due to the lighting and materials. Three male figures are positioned centrally within this setting, with the man on the far left quickly moving from the left to the far right, then instantly appearing between the other two motionless individuals.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
