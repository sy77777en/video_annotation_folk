    "pre_caption": "This full shot is captured from the pumpkin's level, with the camera remaining static throughout. A large, yellow-orange pumpkin is the central subject, positioned in the middle ground and occupying the majority of the frame, slightly left of center. To the right of the pumpkin's stem, a dark green cap is situated in the center-right of the frame, also in the middle ground. Both objects rest on a brown wooden surface that fills the bottom portion of the frame. On the far left, a green vine extends from the pumpkin out of the frame. The background is composed of a white fabric wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a very large, round, yellow-orange pumpkin resting on a wooden surface. The pumpkin has prominent vertical ridges along its surface. Next to the pumpkin's stem sits a dark green baseball cap with a circular orange and white logo on the front. The scene focuses on the gradual enlargement of the pumpkin.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Indoors, within a structure with white fabric walls, a massive, light-orange pumpkin rests on a surface made of brown wooden planks. The pumpkin is round with prominent vertical ribs. To the right of its stem rests a dark green baseball cap featuring a circular logo. On the left, a thick green vine extends from the pumpkin and continues out of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
