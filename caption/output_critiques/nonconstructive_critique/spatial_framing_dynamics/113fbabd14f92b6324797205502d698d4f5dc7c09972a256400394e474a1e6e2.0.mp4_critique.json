    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot. Initially, a wide expanse of brown sand occupies the bottom foreground of the frame. The calm ocean is positioned in the middle ground, with the horizon line bisecting the center of the frame, while the sky, filled with large clouds, takes up the top half of the frame in the background. The camera, positioned at a low height, glides forward from the beach, moving over the gentle waves at the shoreline. As it progresses, the sand disappears from the bottom of the frame, and the ocean water comes to fill the entire lower half, becoming the new foreground and middle ground. The shot concludes with the camera moving steadily over the water's surface, while the sky and horizon remain in their initial positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a coastal scenery shot that begins on a wide, flat expanse of brown sand before gliding forward over the gentle, lapping waves and out across the vast, calm surface of the grey-blue ocean. The sky above is filled with large, low-hanging white and grey clouds, with patches of blue visible between them. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is deliberately placed on the expansive scale and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment. The shot's purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vastness of the sea and sky rather than to highlight a specific object or entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone moves forward from a wide, sandy beach out over the calm, grey-green ocean. The sky above is a mix of blue patches and large, dense white and grey clouds that hang low over the horizon. The drone glides over the wet sand and gentle, lapping waves at the shoreline, continuing its path over the rippling surface of the water until only the sea and sky are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
