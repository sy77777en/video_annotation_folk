    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot focusing on a human head emerging from a blue carpet, occupying approximately one-third of the frame's height and positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. The head remains static throughout the video. Surrounding the head in the foreground are numerous wooden sticks and small objects scattered across the carpet. In the top right corner of the frame, a sofa occupies the background, partially covered with a blue and white patterned blanket, and two magazines rest on it. The top left corner reveals a wooden chest of drawers also in the background. A yellow-framed portrait photograph lies on the floor near the center-right, slightly closer to the foreground. The camera maintains a consistent overhead angle, positioned above the subject, capturing the scene without any noticeable movement or change in shot size or spatial positioning. The overall spatial arrangement remains constant, emphasizing the static nature of the elements within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a human head with short, reddish-brown hair emerging through a blue carpet, occupying about one-third of the frame's height and positioned slightly left of center. The head has a light skin tone and a neutral expression. Scattered around the head are wooden sticks and various small objects on the carpet. In the top right corner, part of a sofa with a blue and white patterned blanket is visible, while in the top left corner, a portion of a wooden chest of drawers can be seen. The setting suggests a home environment with a playful or surreal element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a living room, with a blue carpeted floor scattered with wooden building blocks and toys. A wooden chest of drawers is visible, along with a gray couch covered in a blue and white patterned blanket, on which two magazines are placed. The lighting suggests a natural source, indicating daytime and creating a warm ambiance. A notable element is a human head emerging from the carpet, surrounded by debris, adding an unusual aspect to the scene. The environment is cluttered, with various objects contributing to a sense of disarray. Additionally, a yellow frame containing a portrait photograph is on the floor.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a home setting where a human head emerges through a blue carpet, taking up one-third of the frame's height and positioned slightly left of center. Wooden sticks are scattered on the carpet, with part of a sofa in the top right corner and part of a wooden chest of drawers in the top left corner.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
