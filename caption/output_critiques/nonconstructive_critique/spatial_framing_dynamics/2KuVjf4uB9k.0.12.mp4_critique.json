    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of a black sports car drifting on a paved track. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame, in the foreground, with the track curving into the middle ground. As the car drifts, it moves diagonally across the frame, transitioning from the left to the right side while remaining in the foreground. The white smoke from the rear tires spreads outwards, filling the lower part of the frame. The surrounding arid landscape occupies the background, with sparse vegetation and dusty terrain visible. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned above the car, providing an aerial view that follows the car's movement along the curve. The transition from the initial to the final position showcases the car's dynamic motion and the track's layout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including \"Royal Purple\" and \"Achilles\" on its body. The car is engaged in a drifting maneuver on a paved track, producing a significant amount of white smoke from its rear tires. The car's sleek design and dynamic motion are highlighted as it navigates a curved section of the track, showcasing its agility and power. The setting appears to be an open, arid landscape, enhancing the focus on the car's performance and the dramatic effect of the drifting action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of a winding racetrack set in a dry, open landscape. The setting is outdoors, likely during the day, as indicated by the clear visibility and shadows. The environment features a paved track surrounded by sparse vegetation and dusty terrain, typical of a desert or arid region. Notable visual elements include a black car drifting around the curves of the track, producing thick white smoke from its tires, which contrasts with the muted earth tones of the surroundings. The car's movement creates dynamic patterns on the track, emphasizing the motion and energy of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of speed and precision, with the drone's perspective providing a comprehensive view of the car's path and the expansive landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
