    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot. It opens with a low-angle wide shot focused on the expansive blue sky, which occupies most of the frame. The snow-covered dome of a yurt is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The camera then pans to the right and tilts downward, revealing a broad, snowy landscape. This movement brings the full yurt into the left foreground, while other yurts appear in the middle ground and right background. A car is positioned in the middle ground, and a line of trees stretches across the background. The shot concludes as a stable wide shot, with the sky in the upper half of the frame and the snowy yurt camp filling the lower half, captured from a low camera height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the vastness of the sky and the snowy landscape. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and scale, rather than any specific object, creating a sense of openness and tranquility.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor winter scene with a vast, open blue sky with some clouds. The setting is a snowy landscape featuring several yurts, which are round, tent-like structures with white coverings. Snow blankets the ground, creating a pristine, undisturbed surface. In the background, a line of bare trees stands against the horizon, adding a natural border to the scene. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sky displays a mix of blue and soft, warm hues from the setting sun. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with the snow reflecting the subtle colors of the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
