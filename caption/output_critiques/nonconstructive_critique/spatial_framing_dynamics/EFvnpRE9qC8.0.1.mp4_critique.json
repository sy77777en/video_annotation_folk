    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a woman standing in the center of the frame and the middle ground. To the left, in the foreground, a piece of lighting equipment on a tripod is partially visible. A low concrete wall stretches across the middle ground behind her. In the background, a bright moon is positioned in the top left. The woman initially looks toward the camera before turning her head to her right. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with light skin and long, straight hair, wearing a sleeveless, ankle-length white dress and light-colored long socks without shoes. She stands upright in the center of the scene, sometimes looking toward the camera and then turning her head to the left side of the scene. Her hands are loosely clasped in front of her body, and her facial expression appears neutral. The lighting highlights her figure against a dark background, making her the clear focal point throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place at night on the top level of an outdoor parking structure, with a dark sky and a bright full moon visible near the horizon. The ground is painted green with white parking lines, and the area is bordered by a low concrete wall. Artificial lighting casts a focused, circular pool of light on the ground, creating strong shadows and highlighting the smooth texture of the pavement. A person in a long, white, sleeveless dress stands in the center of the lit area, with their posture and gaze shifting slightly throughout the sequence. The background remains dim, with only faint outlines of distant buildings and the moon providing additional visual elements. The overall scene is quiet and still, with no visible movement apart from the subtle changes in the subject’s stance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
