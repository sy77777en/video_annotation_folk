    "pre_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, the scene is framed by the camera operator's arms in the extreme foreground on the left and right. In the left middle ground, a white car is parked along the street, with a group of stationary people standing on the sidewalk just to its right. In the center and right middle ground, several pedestrians walk away from the camera down the sidewalk, while another group walks towards the camera, entering the frame from the background. The background is composed of multi-story buildings on both sides, with a prominent storefront and a red neon sign in the right middle ground. The sun is positioned in the upper-left background, casting a bright flare and long shadows across the scene from left to right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of people walks and stands on a sunlit city sidewalk. In the center, a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a black tank top and light-blue denim shorts, walks away from the camera. To her right, a woman with reddish-blonde hair is wearing a pink tank top, and next to her is another woman in a white sweatshirt. To the left of the woman in the center, two men stand on the left side of the sidewalk. Three men walk into the frame behind the three women. The man walking in the middle is carrying a black bag, wearing a white T-shirt and black pants. The man to his right is dressed all in black. The man walking behind them is wearing a black hat, a yellow T-shirt, and blue floral pants.On the far right and left, the arm and torso of a person with fair skin are partially in view. A white sedan is parked on the street to the left, with a darker car behind it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a late-afternoon scene on a sun-drenched city street. The bright sun, positioned low on the left, casts a strong lens flare and creates long, dark shadows across the concrete sidewalk. Multi-story buildings with dark metal fire escapes line the street. On the right, a storefront features a red neon sign that reads \"Artistic PIZZA\" above large glass windows. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, and a white sedan is parked on the left side of the street next to a large, leafy green tree.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
