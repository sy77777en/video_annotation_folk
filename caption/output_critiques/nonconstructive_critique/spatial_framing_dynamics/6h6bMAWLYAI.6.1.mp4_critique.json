    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures three women seated at a large, curved, light brown wooden news desk, which occupies the foreground and center of the frame. The woman on the left is positioned on the left side of the desk, the woman in the center is at the center of the desk, and the woman on the right is on the right side of the desk; all three are in the middle ground. Papers are visible on the desk in front of them, in the foreground and middle ground, with a red mug also in the foreground to the left of the leftmost woman. The background consists of dark blue studio walls, yellow-lit panels, and several television screens, with one prominent screen displaying \"WXII NEWS 12\" in the top left/center background. The camera remains static at the subjects' level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three women are seated at a curved wooden news desk. The woman on the left has shoulder-length blonde hair and wears a black V-neck top. The woman in the center has dark brown, shoulder-length hair and is dressed in a red V-neck top. The woman on the right has shoulder-length blonde hair and wears a black V-neck top. All three women are looking towards each other and appear to be engaged in a conversation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A television broadcast-style viewpoint captures an indoor news studio. Three women are seated at a large, curved, light brown wooden news desk. The studio background features a large window set into dark blue walls, with several television screens positioned behind it. Yellow-lit panels are located above the window at the top of the frame. One prominent screen displays \"WXII NEWS 12\". Papers and a red mug are visible on the desk.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
