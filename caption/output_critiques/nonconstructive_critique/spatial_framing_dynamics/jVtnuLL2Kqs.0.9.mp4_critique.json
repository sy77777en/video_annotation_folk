    "pre_caption": "From a fixed position in the center of the back seat, the video presents a medium shot of the driver from behind. The two front seats occupy the foreground on the left and right, framing the central view. In the middle ground, the driver is positioned slightly to the right of the center, with the car's dashboard and center console visible below the windshield. The background, seen through the front windshield, is filled with a forward view of the road, where another car travels ahead in the center. The urban scenery visible through the side windows is blurred, indicating the car's rapid forward motion, which creates a time-lapse effect. The camera is positioned at the driver's level, and a white logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a viewpoint in the back seat, a person with short, dark hair, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, is seen from behind while driving a car. The driver is positioned in the right-hand seat of the light-colored station wagon. The car's grey interior is visible, including the two front seats with black headrests, the dashboard, and the center console. Through the front windshield, another dark-colored vehicle can be seen driving ahead.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead from inside a moving car during the daytime. The dark headrests of the two front seats frame the view of the grey dashboard and the windshield, where a silhouetted person is visible in the driver's seat of the right-hand drive vehicle. Through the front window, the car travels along a paved road with other vehicles ahead, while the scenery in the side windows is blurred due to motion. The environment appears to be urban or suburban, with concrete barriers lining the road. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a white logo.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from an interior dashcam positioned at the backseat center of the car, framing a medium shot of the driver from behind. The camera faces forward through the windshield, with car interior elements visible as the driver sits off-center to the right, while the motion-blurred city street fills the background due to the time-lapse effect.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
