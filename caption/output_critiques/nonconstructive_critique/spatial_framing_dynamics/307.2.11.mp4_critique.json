    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot where a person's upper body, seen from the back with arms outstretched, is centrally positioned in the foreground, with their arms extending towards the left and right edges of the frame. The ground is visible at the bottom of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground, while blurred vegetation forms the background across the top. The framing then transitions to a medium shot as the person, remaining in the center foreground, becomes smaller within the frame, consequently revealing more of the ground and the background vegetation. Throughout this transition, the camera maintains a position at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, seen from the back with arms outstretched, wears a brightly colored, patterned shirt featuring hues of blue, red, and orange in what appears to be a floral or abstract design. A white strap is visible over his left shoulder. On his head, he wears a red and white patterned knit cap that includes a hint of blue and a unique structure. From his outstretched arms, it is evident that he has dark skin.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds outdoors on a sunlit day, featuring a field of autumnal golden-brown grass or wheat. Indistinct natural vegetation, possibly dark-colored trees, forms a blurred backdrop. A house and a visible blue sky can be partially seen behind the trees. A figure, dressed in a brightly patterned coat with blue, red, and orange hues and a red and white patterned head covering, is captured in dynamic motion with outstretched arms. A white strap is visible across the figure's left shoulder and left side of the torso. The overall visual quality is characterized by motion blur and a somewhat hazy appearance.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's upper body, seen from the back with arms outstretched, positioned slightly off-center in the foreground. Their arms extend towards the left and right edges of the frame. The ground, covered with patches of grass and small stones, is visible at the bottom of the frame, while lush, blurred vegetation forms the background across the top. As the framing transitions to a medium shot, the person appears smaller within the frame, revealing more of the textured ground and the dense background vegetation. During this transition, the camera rotates slightly, causing a subtle tilt in the frame while maintaining its position at the subject's level.",
