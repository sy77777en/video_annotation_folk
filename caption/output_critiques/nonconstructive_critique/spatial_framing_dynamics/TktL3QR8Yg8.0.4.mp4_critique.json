    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a ground-level medium shot, placing a teddy bear in the bottom center foreground with its back to the camera. A person's lower body, visible from the waist down, enters from the right side of the frame and moves on their knees into the middle ground. They pull a white sheet, which initially occupies the center middle ground, upward and off-screen to the right. This action reveals a large, metal Ferris wheel structure that now occupies the center middle ground, positioned directly in front of the bear. A warm, glowing light in the background is visible through the Ferris wheel's frame. The person then exits the frame to the right, leaving a static shot with the bear in the foreground looking at the Ferris wheel in the middle ground. Throughout the scene, the camera remains stationary and at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a furry bear toy sitting on a carpeted floor, surrounded by miniature toys and scattered papers. A person wearing striped clothes enters the scene, visible from the waist down, moving on their knees. They pull a covered rack draped in white fabric into view and lift the fabric, revealing the lower base of a steel Ferris wheel structure. The Ferris wheel is illuminated by a warm, glowing light in the background. The person then exits the frame, leaving the bear toy facing the now fully visible Ferris wheel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, nostalgic atmosphere. The scene features a dimly lit room with a soft, amber glow, highlighting a small Ferris wheel model made of metal beams. A plush teddy bear sits on the carpeted floor, facing the Ferris wheel, creating a sense of stillness and contemplation. Scattered around are various toys, including a toy car and a small carousel, adding to the playful yet serene environment. The room's decor includes intricate patterns on the walls, contributing to a vintage aesthetic. The overall ambiance suggests a quiet, reflective moment, with the lighting and arrangement of objects evoking a sense of childhood wonder.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a ground-level shot of a furry bear toy sitting on a carpeted floor, surrounded by miniature toys and scattered papers. A person wearing striped clothes enters the frame, their lower body visible as they move on their knees, pulling a covered rack draped in white fabric into view. They lift the fabric, revealing the lower base of a steel Ferris wheel structure, illuminated by a warm, glowing light in the background, before exiting the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
