    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, initially capturing a quiet Japanese street that recedes from the bottom center into the background. Traditional buildings line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, with a green hill visible in the distant background. The camera then slowly pans to the right. This movement shifts the focus to the right side of the street, bringing a modern storefront with the name \"TOHGORO\" into the right half of the frame. A utility pole with a sign is now prominent in the right foreground. In front of the shop, a small tree and a red-and-white striped table are positioned in the middle ground, while a small wooden display table sits in the right foreground at the shop's entrance. The left side of the street and the buildings there are now positioned on the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a tranquil streetscape scenery shot in a traditional Japanese town. The focus is on the serene atmosphere and architectural details of the environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of place and calm. The paved street is flanked by classic Japanese buildings with wooden facades and tiled roofs. In the distance, a lush, green hill rises against a clear blue sky. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a modern storefront for a shop named \"TOHGORO,\" which displays pottery and other goods through its large glass windows. A \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign is posted on the far right utility pole. Behind it, at the entrance to a shop, a wooden table displays some small tea sets. Further back, a red-and-white striped table in front of a glass window holds some small goods, and next to it stands a two-story tree, adding a touch of color to the quiet morning scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along a quiet, paved street in a Japanese town during the daytime. The street is lined with traditional two-story buildings with wooden and beige exteriors and tiled roofs. In the background, a lush green hill rises against a clear blue sky. The camera pans to the right, focusing on a modern storefront with large glass windows and the name \"TOHGORO\" visible inside. The shop's interior is warmly lit, showcasing pottery on display shelves. Outside the shop, a small tree stands on the sidewalk, and a utility pole features a \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign with Japanese characters. Nearby, a stand is covered with a red-and-white striped cloth.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
