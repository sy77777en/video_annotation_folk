    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, static scenery shot of a monument at night. The central quadriga sculpture is positioned in the upper center of the frame, existing in the middle ground. Below it, the monument's facade, adorned with statues and an inscription, occupies the lower half of the frame, also in the middle ground. The dark night sky fills the top portion of the frame, serving as the background. The camera maintains a fixed, low-angle perspective, looking up at the illuminated structure, with no changes to the spatial composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scene focused on the top of a grand, classical monument illuminated against a dark night sky. The central feature is a magnificent quadriga sculpture, where a gleaming golden figure of a woman is positioned near the four rearing horses of a striking teal or verdigris patina. On the opposite side of the horses, another partially visible golden figure also guides them. Below the centerpiece, in front of the facade, are stone statues that appear to be soldiers. The facade itself is adorned with intricate bas-relief carvings and a large inscription. The camera's static gaze is fixed on the architectural element, emphasizing the majestic scale and dramatic lighting of the structure to create a powerful, atmospheric scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, nighttime shot captures the illuminated top of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris against a dark sky. The central feature is a quadriga, a chariot pulled by four teal-colored bronze horses, driven by two gilded golden female figures. The monument itself is constructed from light-colored stone, adorned with intricate bas-reliefs, carvings, and lines of statues of soldiers below the central feature. A large stone plaque with a French inscription is visible below the main sculpture. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ PHOTOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
