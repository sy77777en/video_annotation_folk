    "pre_caption": "The video presents a screen recording of a pixelated computer interface, framed as a direct, eye-level view. Initially, the \"Hypnospace Zone Hub\" window occupies the central foreground. Within this window, four rectangular buttons are stacked vertically in the center: \"HYPNOSPACE CENTRAL\" at the top, followed by \"THE CAFE,\" \"GOODTIME VALLEY,\" and \"HSPD HEADQUARTERS\" at the bottom. A white arrow cursor, initially in the bottom center foreground, moves to and clicks the \"HSPD HEADQUARTERS\" button. The view within the window then transitions to the \"HSPD Enforcer Handbook.\" In this new view, a \"NO VIOLATION POINTS\" banner is positioned at the top center foreground, with an \"HSPD DISPATCH'S STATUS\" box below it. The central foreground is dominated by a large \"H S P D HEADQUARTERS\" graphic. As the cursor moves to the right foreground, the page content scrolls upwards: the \"H S P D HEADQUARTERS\" graphic moves towards the top of the window, and abstract geometric shapes, resembling stylized buildings, scroll into view from the bottom, occupying the bottom-center foreground. The main \"HYPNOSPACE EXPLORER\" window, with its purple border and top title bar, remains static in the overall foreground throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a pixelated computer interface, reminiscent of late 1990s software, presented within a purple-bordered window labeled \"HYPNOSPACE EXPLORER\" and showing the date \"1999.11.05\" and time \"9:04P.\" Initially, this interface, titled \"Hypnospace Zone Hub,\" contains four dark purple rectangular buttons, each with a unique colorful pixelated icon—a purple swirl, a brown stylized face, a green landscape, and a blue emblem—and white descriptive text. A white pixelated arrow cursor clicks on the \"HSPD HEADQUARTERS\" button. The view then shifts to the \"HSPD Enforcer Handbook\" page, which prominently features a large graphic on a beige background: \"H S P D\" in large, blue-outlined white block letters above \"HEADQUARTERS\" in smaller black letters, both underlined by black zig-zag lines. Scrolling down this page reveals abstract, pastel-colored geometric shapes resembling stylized buildings at the bottom. Text elements throughout provide labels and status information, such as \"NO VIOLATION POINTS.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface shows a purple-themed desktop environment labeled \"HYPNOSPACE EXPLORER\" at the top, with the date \"1999.11.05\" and time \"9:04P\" displayed. Initially, a window titled \"Hypnospace Zone Hub\" is active, presenting a list of clickable zones: \"HYPNOSPACE CENTRAL,\" \"THE CAFE,\" \"GOODTIME VALLEY,\" and \"HSPD HEADQUARTERS,\" each with a small icon and a short description. A white arrow cursor clicks on \"HSPD HEADQUARTERS.\" The view transitions to a new page within this section, now titled \"HSPD Enforcer Handbook.\" This page features a banner indicating \"NO VIOLATION POINTS\" and \"MODEL CITIZEN,\" and a \"HSPD DISPATCH'S STATUS\" update. The central part of this page displays a large, stylized graphic with \"H S P D\" in large, blue-outlined letters above the word \"HEADQUARTERS\" in a black serif font, all set against a beige, textured background with black zig-zag borders. The interface has a distinct pixelated, retro visual style.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
