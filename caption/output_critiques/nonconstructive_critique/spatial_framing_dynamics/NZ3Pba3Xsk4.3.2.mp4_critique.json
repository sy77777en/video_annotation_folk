    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a rhinoceros positioned in the center of the middle ground, walking toward the right side of the frame. In the foreground, several water jets spray upward from behind a low concrete wall, while a small pool of water is visible in the bottom right. Large rocks are arranged across the middle ground, with trees and a building in the background. The camera then pans to the left, revealing a second rhinoceros standing still in the middle ground on the left side of the enclosure. The shot concludes as a wide shot with the second rhinoceros on the left and the first rhinoceros on the far right, both remaining in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on the rear of a large, gray rhinoceros with thick, folded skin as it walks forward away from the camera. As the rhinoceros moves, the camera pans to the left, revealing a second, similar-looking rhinoceros standing still on the left side of the enclosure. This second rhinoceros is also large and gray with wrinkled skin and is positioned facing toward the left. The enclosure features a small, muddy pool of water, large rocks, and several sprinklers spraying water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor animal enclosure is seen during the daytime, set against a backdrop of lush, green-leafed trees. The ground is mostly dirt, with large, dark grey rocks forming part of the landscape. A simple building with a light green wall is partially visible behind the trees. Within the enclosure, two large, grey rhinoceroses are present. The scene features a small, muddy pool of water on the right with a fountain spraying into it, and another small pool on the left. In the foreground, behind a low concrete wall, several jets of water spray upwards. The camera pans slightly to the left, revealing the second rhinoceros standing near the rocks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
