    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, captured from the subject's level, showing a vintage camera in the center middle ground on a wooden surface that occupies the bottom of the frame. A red and white mini fridge stands in the middle ground directly behind the camera, flanked by potted plants on the left and right. The shot then transitions to a full shot, bringing the subjects closer to the viewer, as large yellow text appears in the top center, superimposed over the mini fridge and above the camera. The final composition maintains this central framing, with the camera and text as the primary focal points.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A silver and black vintage SLR camera with a black lens is positioned centrally on a wooden surface, illuminated by a spotlight from above. Behind the camera, a red and white rectangular mini fridge with a glass door stands vertically, featuring the words \"ICE COLD\" in white lettering on a red vertical stripe, with a signature in red lettering on the white horizontal stripe. To the right of these central items are potted plants with dark green leaves in dark-colored pots, along with other indistinguishable objects due to the lack of light. Large, yellow, sans-serif capital letters spelling \"THE FILM LOOK\" are superimposed over the red and white object and positioned above the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a single spotlight from above illuminates a wooden surface. Centered in the light is a vintage silver and black SLR camera. Behind it, a red and white mini fridge with the words \"ICE COLD\" and a signature is partially visible. On either side of the camera, potted plants and indistinct objects are cast in deep shadow. The text \"THE FILM LOOK\" appears as a yellow overlay, positioned centrally over the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
