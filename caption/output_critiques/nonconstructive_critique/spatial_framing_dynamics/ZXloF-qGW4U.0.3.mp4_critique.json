    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a man positioned in the right foreground, walking toward the camera down a narrow, red-lit corridor. Behind him, two other figures are visible as silhouettes in the middle ground, one in the center and one slightly to the left. As the main subject moves forward, the shot tightens into a medium close-up, with his figure shifting to occupy the center of the frame. The figures behind him remain in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, dark hair is the main subject, walking forward in a dark, red-lit corridor. He wears a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie, and his expression appears serious. Following behind him is another man, mostly rendered as a dark silhouette, distinguished by the fedora-style hat he is wearing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, narrow indoor hallway, completely saturated in a deep red light. Several figures, appearing as dark silhouettes, move through the confined space. A man in a suit and tie is visible in the foreground, with two individuals behind him who appear to be police officers. They engage in a brief conversation with him but do not follow. The person wearing a hat is the one who continues to follow him down the dimly lit corridor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
