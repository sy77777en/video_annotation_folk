    "pre_caption": "The video is a close-up shot. It opens with a white cigarette pack, visibly wet with small droplets, positioned in the bottom left foreground. The camera is initially positioned slightly above this pack, also framing a dark, reflective surface (which also shows droplets) that occupies the top and central portions of the frame in the middle ground and background; a red reflection is noticeable in the top right background of this surface, and a white streak of light is visible from the top left towards the center. As the sequence progresses, the camera subtly shifts or tilts downwards, focusing more on the pack. A hand then enters from the bottom right foreground, moves across to the pack in the bottom left, grasps it, and subsequently pulls both itself and the pack out of the frame towards the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This close-up video focuses on a white pack of cigarettes featuring white text outlined in dark red, accompanied by a blue pattern. Prominently displayed on the pack is the word \"RELAX\" in a stylized font, along with the phrase \"ENJOY YOUR.\" The surface of the cigarette pack appears wet, covered in small droplets. Subsequently, a light-skinned human hand enters the frame from the lower right and grasps the pack, removing it from sight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, enclosed space, possibly the interior of a vehicle. A cigarette case, predominantly white with red and blue markings and the word \"RELAX\" visible, is present. The surrounding environment is dimly lit, with reflections and what appear to be water droplets above. A red reflection is visible on the right side of the frame. A hand appears, takes the cigarette case, and then exits the frame.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera moves from top to bottom, lingering on a pack of cigarettes, which is then removed by a hand. Overall, it is a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera begins above the subject, lowers to match the subject’s height, and then the subject exits the frame.",
