    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in an extreme wide shot from a low-angle perspective, looking up at the dark facade of a building that occupies most of the frame in the middle ground. In the upper center, an illuminated window and its small balcony are visible. Within the window, a small, orange, animated character and a glass object are positioned in the middle ground. Black utility wires run diagonally from the top right corner toward the center, situated in the foreground, while a portion of the dark night sky is visible in the background at the top right. The entire composition remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An orange, animated, mouse-like character with a round head is visible on a windowsill. The character has large, elliptical, white eyes with black pupils and a prominent light orange muzzle. Next to the character, on the windowsill, is a transparent, conical object that appears to be made of glass.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, the dark, textured exterior of a building is shown at night under a dark blue sky. A single rectangular window on an upper floor is illuminated from within by a warm, yellow light. In front of the window is a small, decorative balcony with an ornate, dark metal railing. To the right, black utility wires with white ceramic insulators are attached to the building's facade. The surface of the building appears damp, as if from a light rain.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
