    "pre_caption": "The video displays a full shot where a large, sepia-toned blueprint fills the foreground and middle ground. A thin, red, cylindrical object is consistently visible in the upper right of the frame, positioned behind the blueprint, while a plain, light-colored, out-of-focus surface forms the background. The camera, initially positioned above the blueprint, pans slowly from right to left across its surface; consequently, the details of the drawing appear to move from the left towards the right side of the frame. Concurrently with this pan, the camera's height transitions from its initial position above the blueprint to become level with it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a close-up of a large, sepia-toned blueprint. The paper is yellowed with age and shows distinct vertical creases, indicating it has been folded. The blueprint itself is covered in intricate black ink drawings, depicting various views of a complex vessel, likely a ship, with detailed side elevations, plan views of different decks, and cross-sections. Numerous annotations, labels, and measurements are visible throughout the drawings. In the upper right portion of the view, a thin, red, cylindrical object, possibly a pointer, is partially visible, positioned behind the blueprint, angled parallel to it, slanting from the upper left to the lower right within the upper right portion of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene presents a large, sepia-toned blueprint, marked by visible vertical creases that indicate its age and previous folding. This extensive technical drawing, filled with intricate lines, labels, and dimensions, depicts various elevations, plan views, and detailed deck layouts of a complex marine vessel. It is set against a plain, light-colored, out-of-focus background. A thin, red, rod-like object is partially visible in the upper right portion of the frame, angled downwards. The camera slowly pans across the surface of the blueprint, offering a clear and detailed observation of its design elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
