    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the foreground, occupying the center-right of the frame and holding the camera at her own level. Behind her in the middle ground, a man carrying a child is located to the left of the center. Tall grass fills the foreground and middle ground around the subjects. In the background, hills and trees extend across the upper portion of the frame. The entire group moves forward through the grass, with the woman leading and the man and child following, maintaining their consistent spatial arrangement throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long brown hair and a focused expression is in the foreground, wearing a wide-brimmed maroon fedora, a red shirt, and a blue denim jacket. Behind her and to the left, a man with long brown hair, a beard, and a backward-facing tan baseball cap with a camera mounted on it walks while carrying a young girl. The man is dressed in a blue and green plaid shirt and light brown pants, with sunglasses hanging from his collar. The young, blonde-haired girl he is holding wears a pink and purple tie-dye shirt and dark pants, and she is eating a small, light-colored object on a stick.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a group walking through a field of tall, dense green grass. The scene is set outdoors under a cloudy sky, with tree-covered hills visible in the background. The person holding the camera is a woman with long brown hair, wearing a red fedora-style hat and a blue denim jacket over a red shirt. Following behind her is a man with long hair and a beard, dressed in a blue and green plaid shirt and a tan baseball cap worn backward. He is carrying a small, blonde-haired child who is wearing a pink and purple tie-dye shirt. The group moves forward through the high grass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
