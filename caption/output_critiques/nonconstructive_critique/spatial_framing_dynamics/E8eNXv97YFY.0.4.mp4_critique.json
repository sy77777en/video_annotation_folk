    "pre_caption": "This static, extreme wide shot captures a large, open-air stadium from a high vantage point within the stands. The foreground is composed of empty, tiered concrete stands that occupy the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a green grass field sits in the center, encircled by a running track. A few small figures are visible on the central field. The main grandstand with a roof is positioned in the upper center, beyond the field, while tall light poles stand on the left and right. The background features a city skyline stretching across the upper portion of the frame, set against a partly cloudy sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a wide cityscape scenery shot of a large, open-air stadium. A vibrant green grass field, where a few small figures can be seen, is encircled by a reddish-brown and grey running track. The expansive, tiered concrete stands are largely empty, with one section covered by a prominent roof structure, and the city skyline is visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level-angle, wide perspective, the scene captures a large, outdoor stadium during the day. A central, vibrant green grass field is surrounded by a grey concrete running track inside and a reddish-brown running track outside. The stadium's seating consists of weathered, tiered concrete stands that encircle the track. A main grandstand with a light-colored roof stands out. The foreground shows the empty, stepped concrete of the stands. Tall light poles are positioned around the stadium, and in the distance, a city skyline is visible beneath a sky with scattered white and grey clouds. A few small figures can be seen on the grass field.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
