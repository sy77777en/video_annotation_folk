    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a large elephant is positioned in the left-middle ground, partially obscured by thorny green bushes and dry grass that occupy the foreground and bottom of the frame. In the background, more savanna vegetation and scattered trees are visible. The camera is positioned at the elephant's level, and the framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large African elephant with dark brown, wrinkled skin stands on the left side of the scene, partially obscured by tall, dry grass and green, thorny bushes. The elephant is oriented towards the right with its head lowered, and its large, floppy ears are a prominent feature. A single white tusk is visible on its right side as it appears to forage in the savanna vegetation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an outdoor, arid savanna under soft, warm light. The landscape is characterized by a mix of dry, pale-yellow grass and dense, thorny green bushes that dominate the foreground and mid-ground. In the background, scattered, thin-trunked trees with sparse foliage are visible. A large, dark-skinned elephant with a visible tusk stands partially obscured by the vegetation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
