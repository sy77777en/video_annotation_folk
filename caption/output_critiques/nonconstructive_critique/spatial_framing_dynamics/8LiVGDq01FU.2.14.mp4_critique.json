    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot, positioning a man in the center-left foreground, viewed from his back and left side as he extends his arms forward. Surrounding him are dark, parallel structures in the middle ground and background, arranged in dense horizontal and vertical layers, with a dark, reflective floor at the bottom of the frame. As the scene progresses, these horizontal structures in the middle ground and background appear to rush past the man from right to left. The shot then transitions to a wide shot, making the man appear smaller in the center-left foreground, while the vast, complex environment fills more of the frame. Finally, a bright white-yellow light erupts from the center background, expanding to engulf the background and silhouetting the man in the foreground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen primarily from the back and side, wears a light-colored helmet, a dark grey jacket with lighter grey or white straps forming a harness, and light grey pants. He also wears dark gloves. His arms are often extended forward as if reaching or bracing himself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds within a dark, complex indoor environment characterized by seemingly infinite, parallel structures. These structures, resembling vast stacks of books or files with varied muted colors, are arranged in dense horizontal and vertical layers, creating a labyrinthine effect. The floor is a dark, reflective surface, mirroring the intricate geometry and sparse, bright lights that pierce the gloom. A figure, clad in a light helmet and a dark suit with light-colored harnesses, appears to float in this abstract space. As the environment shifts and expands, the horizontal elements rush past, enhancing the sense of motion. The scene culminates in an intense burst of bright, white-yellow light that engulfs the background, transforming the intricate details into a bright, abstract expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

As the scene progresses, these horizontal structures in the middle ground and background appear to shift rapidly from left to right, creating a sense of motion.
