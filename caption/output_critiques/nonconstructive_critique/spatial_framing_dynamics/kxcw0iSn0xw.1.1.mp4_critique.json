    "pre_caption": "In this medium shot, filmed at the subject's level, a shirtless man is initially positioned from behind in the center-right middle ground. A green football field occupies the lower middle ground, with blurred stadium bleachers in the background. A brown American football is visible in the left foreground, near the man. As the shot progresses, the football moves further left and slightly more into the foreground, ultimately exiting the frame on the left. Concurrently, the camera pans slightly to the right, shifting the man, who also subtly turns his upper body to his right, from the center-right towards the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a shirtless man with a light skin tone and a muscular back, viewed from behind. He is wearing dark blue shorts and a red cap, with short dark hair visible underneath. A prominent red mark or rash is apparent on the right side of his back. Positioned to the left of the man and slightly behind him is a brown leather American football with white laces, seemingly flying away from the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a bright, sunny day at a football stadium. A green grass field occupies the middleground, while rows of empty, grey bleachers extend into the blurred background. A brown leather football with white laces, oval in shape, is visible in mid-air to the left of a shirtless individual whose back is to the camera.  A noticeable red mark is present on the person's back.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
