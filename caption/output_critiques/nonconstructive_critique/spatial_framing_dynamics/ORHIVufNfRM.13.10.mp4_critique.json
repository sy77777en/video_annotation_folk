    "pre_caption": "This video is framed from a first-person perspective, looking out through the red-edged viewport of a mask or submersible. The scene is set in a dark, underwater environment, with the sandy seafloor occupying the lower half of the frame, sloping down from left to right. In the middle ground, two prominent clusters of glowing organisms are positioned in the top left and bottom right, with smaller, dimmer clusters and blue crystalline structures scattered between them. The background consists of dark, deep water. A pair of red-gloved hands enters the frame from the bottom center foreground, moving into the middle ground and waving gently before retracting. Throughout the shot, the camera pans slightly, shifting the view across the bioluminescent scenery. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, looking slightly downward at the immediate seafloor and forward into the open water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a first-person perspective shot from within a diving suit or submersible, framed by the red edges of a mask or viewport. The only visible part of the person is their hands, which are covered in red gloves. The hands appear from the bottom of the frame and simply wave in the water. The small, glowing blue crystalline objects floating in the dark water appear to be groups of fish.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set underwater in a dark, open environment. The scene is illuminated by clusters of small, glowing blue and white organisms scattered across the sandy ocean floor and attached to rocks, creating a soft, bioluminescent effect. The water appears deep and shadowy, with limited visibility beyond the immediate area. Occasional patches of blue coral-like structures and other marine life are visible, adding texture and variety to the seafloor. The lower edge of the view is partially framed by the dark, rounded outline of a mask or helmet, reinforcing the immersive perspective. Overlay elements are present, including a faint watermark with the text \"Loopy Longplay\" in the lower left corner, which is not part of the underwater scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video is a first-person perspective shot through a diver’s mask. The frame shows the mask’s edges, the person’s hands, and the underwater scenery, making it difficult to determine the shot size.",
