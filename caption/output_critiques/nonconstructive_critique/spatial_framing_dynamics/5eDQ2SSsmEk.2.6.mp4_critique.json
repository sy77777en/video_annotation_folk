    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man seated inside a vehicle. The man occupies the left side of the frame, positioned in the foreground, while the vehicle's interior elements such as the steering wheel and dashboard are situated towards the right, also in the foreground. The man's face and upper body are visible, with his hands holding a takeout container and chopsticks. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the sequence. Initially, the man's hand with the chopsticks is closer to the center of the frame, gradually moving towards the right as he brings the chopsticks to his mouth. The rain-streaked window is in the background, occupying the upper right portion of the frame, contributing to the dimly lit ambiance. The coiled cord hangs near the window, slightly to the right. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height; the focus remains consistently on the man and his actions within the confined space of the car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man sitting inside a vehicle, holding a takeout container with chopsticks. He has a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and facial stubble. He is wearing a dark jacket over a collared shirt. The man appears focused on eating, with the chopsticks poised above the container. The interior of the vehicle is dimly lit, and the window beside him is streaked with raindrops, suggesting a rainy setting outside. The steering wheel is visible, indicating he is in the driver's seat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a vehicle during nighttime. The environment is dimly lit, with the interior illuminated by soft, ambient light reflecting off the wet, rain-speckled windows, suggesting rainy weather outside. The scene features a person seated in the driver's seat, holding a takeout container with chopsticks, indicating a casual, intimate moment. The vehicle's dashboard and steering wheel are visible, with a coiled cord hanging nearby, adding to the confined, personal atmosphere. The overall color palette is muted, with dark tones and subtle highlights from the exterior lights filtering through the rain-streaked glass, creating a moody, contemplative ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
