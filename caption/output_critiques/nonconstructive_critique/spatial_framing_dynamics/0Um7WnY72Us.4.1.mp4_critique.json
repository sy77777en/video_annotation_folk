    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a shirtless man seated in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. His torso, marked with bruises and wounds, is prominently displayed. Positioned at the subject's level, the camera captures him from the waist up, maintaining a consistent shot size throughout. Behind him, in the background, the wall is densely covered with papers and documents, creating a cluttered backdrop. These papers are spread across the entire wall, filling the top and sides of the frame. A desk is partially visible in the bottom right corner, situated in the middle ground. The man remains stationary, with no noticeable changes in his position or the arrangement of elements around him. The camera angle and framing stay constant, focusing on the subject and the immediate surroundings without any shifts or transitions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a shirtless man with a light skin tone, sitting and facing forward. He has medium-length, dark, wavy hair and a beard. His expression is neutral. His torso is marked with visible bruises and wounds, particularly on his chest and shoulder. The setting suggests an indoor environment with papers on the wall behind him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a dimly lit room which is chaotic and disorganized. The walls are covered with various papers and documents, fixed in place, creating a backdrop of scattered information. The lighting is subdued, casting soft shadows. The setting suggests a workspace or study area, with a desk partially visible, adding to the sense of a personal or investigative environment. The overall color palette is muted. The scene remains static, emphasizing the enclosed, intimate nature of the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
