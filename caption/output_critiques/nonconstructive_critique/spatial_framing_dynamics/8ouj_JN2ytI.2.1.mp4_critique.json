    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot. In the right foreground, a masked man in a shearling coat stands, holding a device towards a kneeling man positioned in the center foreground. To the left of the kneeling man, in the middle ground, stands a bald man in tactical gear, and further to the far left, another armed man with a beard is also in the middle ground. Several other armed men are visible in the middle ground, distributed around these central figures. The background features a large scoreboard with \"Doritos\" and \"UPMC\" logos at the top center and top left, while stadium bleachers filled with spectators in yellow occupy the top right and extend across the upper background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A bald man, distinguished by a complex black mask covering his mouth and nose and a thick brown leather shearling coat with a light-colored fur collar, stands over a kneeling, middle-aged man with graying dark hair. The kneeling man, wearing a light-blue collared shirt, a dark-grey V-neck sweater vest, and a dark jacket draped over his shoulders, looks upward. To the left of the kneeling man, another bald man with a light skin tone is visible, wearing a dark tactical vest over a brown jacket, a red scarf around his neck, and holding a large black rifle. Further to the left, a man with dark hair and a beard, dressed in a dark tactical vest laden with ammunition pouches over a dark shirt, also has a deep red scarf around his neck and holds a rifle. Several other men in rugged, military-style attire, some armed, are positioned around these central figures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors on a green football field during the daytime, under an overcast sky. In the background, a large scoreboard displays \"Doritos\" and \"UPMC\" logos, with stadium bleachers filled with spectators visible further back. Several men in military-style attire, some armed, are present on the field. One man, wearing a distinctive mask and a brown leather coat with a fur collar, stands over another man who is kneeling and dressed in civilian clothes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
