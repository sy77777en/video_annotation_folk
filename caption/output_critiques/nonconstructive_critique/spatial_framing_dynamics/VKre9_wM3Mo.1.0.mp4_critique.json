    "pre_caption": "A glowing white rectangular graphic is positioned in the center middle ground, with a black banner directly below it at the bottom center. In the left foreground, a vertical column of semi-transparent cubes is arranged against a dark gray background. The camera, positioned at a straight-on angle, slowly zooms out, causing all elements to shrink within the frame. Simultaneously, the cubes on the left progressively darken from top to bottom until they turn black.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a static digital advertisement on a dark gray background. At the center is a glowing white rectangular graphic containing text and three circular images arranged vertically. The top image features a person in a red jacket on a snowy mountain peak. The middle image displays three hot air balloons in shades of orange, yellow, and dark colors floating against a blue sky. The bottom image captures a purple and orange sunset. Below this graphic, a black banner with white text reads \"80000hours.org/fern\". Along the left side of the screen, a vertical column of small, translucent cubes gradually darkens from top to bottom as the camera zooms out.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds against a dark gray gradient background as the camera slowly zooms out. In the center, a large, white rectangular panel glows, displaying text and three circular images: a person on a snowy mountain, three hot air balloons in shades of orange, yellow, and darker tones set against a blue sky, and a vibrant purple and orange sunset. To the left of this central panel, a column of small, semi-transparent cubes is arranged in a somewhat irregular pattern, gradually darkening from top to bottom until they turn black. In the top right corner, a small black rectangular overlay displays the white letters \"AD.\" Below the white rectangular panel, the text \"80000hours.org/fern\" is prominently displayed, not as an overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
