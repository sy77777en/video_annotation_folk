    "pre_caption": "This video features an extreme wide shot of a dynamic cityscape. Initially, a tall building with reflective glass and red accents dominates the left side of the frame, extending from bottom to top in the foreground to middle ground. A large construction crane is positioned in the top right, silhouetted against the sky in the middle ground, while the sky itself, with teal, orange, and pink hues, occupies the background. The camera then executes a rapid counter-clockwise rotation and appears to ascend. As it moves, the building on the left exits the frame. The crane initially in the top right shifts across the top of the frame towards the left. Another large crane becomes prominent, moving from the right and center towards the bottom center of the frame, extending upwards into the foreground and middle ground. The surrounding cityscape becomes visible along the top edge of the frame (acting as a horizon due to the upward tilt) in the background. The camera is positioned below the structures, looking upwards throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, featuring a rotating perspective that sweeps across tall, modern buildings with reflective glass facades and prominent construction cranes silhouetted against a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a significant element, transitioning from a cool teal to warm hues of orange and pink, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The absence of a singular main subject is due to the shot's emphasis on the overall urban environment, the atmospheric quality of the light and sky, and the sense of scale and movement, which collectively create an immersive experience of the city's architecture and ambiance rather than focusing on any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a dynamic perspective of an urban construction site at sunset. A tall building with a red wall and glass windows initially appears on the right side of the frame and then exits as the camera moves. Several large construction cranes, with their intricate metal lattice structures, are visible against a teal sky tinged with vibrant pink and orange hues from the setting sun. The drone's movement creates a sense of rapid ascent and rotation, with the surrounding cityscape and cranes appearing to shift and blur.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
