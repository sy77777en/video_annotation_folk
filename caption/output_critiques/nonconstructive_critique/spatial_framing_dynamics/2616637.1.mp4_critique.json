    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a butterfly perched on vibrant orange and red flowers amidst lush green foliage. Initially, the butterfly is centered in the frame, occupying the middle ground, with its wings partially open. The flowers and leaves surround it, filling the foreground and background. The butterfly is positioned slightly towards the left side of the frame. As the video progresses, the butterfly repeatedly opens and closes its wings, maintaining its central position. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout most of the sequence. Towards the end, the camera shifts to an elevated position, providing a view from above the butterfly, which continues to interact with the flowers. The spatial arrangement remains consistent, with the butterfly as the focal point, surrounded by the colorful flora. The camera's transition from the subject's level to above it subtly alters the perspective, offering a broader view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a butterfly with striking black wings adorned with white and light blue spots. It is perched on vibrant orange and red flowers, which are surrounded by lush green leaves. The butterfly repeatedly opens and closes its wings, showcasing its intricate pattern, and appears to be feeding or resting on the flowers. The scene highlights the contrast between the butterfly's dark, patterned wings and the bright, colorful flowers, creating a vivid and natural display.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a vibrant outdoor garden scene filled with lush green foliage and clusters of bright orange and red flowers. The setting is likely during the day, as the lighting is natural and clear. The flowers have a textured appearance with small, rounded petals, and the leaves are broad with visible veins. A butterfly with striking black wings adorned with white and light blue spots is prominently featured, fluttering among the flowers. Some flowers in the garden have already bloomed, while others are still in bud, adding depth to the scene. The environment is rich in color, with the contrasting hues of the butterfly and flowers creating a lively and dynamic visual. The scene is calm, with no visible weather effects, emphasizing the natural beauty of the garden.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
