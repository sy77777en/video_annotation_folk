    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a green figure in the center of the frame, descending from the top against a cloudy sky, with metal fencing in the foreground at the bottom. As the figure moves downward toward the camera, the shot transitions to a medium shot at the subject's level. He lands in the center of the frame, crouched in the foreground on a grassy lawn, with a large stone building positioned in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, muscular, green-skinned humanoid figure with dark, shaggy hair is depicted. He is shirtless, wearing only a pair of dark, torn pants, and is barefoot. The figure is shown in mid-air with his arms outstretched, and then lands on a grassy area on his hands and knees in a crouched, powerful pose.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a manicured green lawn in front of a large, institutional-style building constructed from grey stone with arched windows. The sky is completely overcast with dense, grey clouds, creating dim, diffused daylight. A large, green-skinned figure descends from the sky, passing over some metal fencing before landing forcefully on the grass in a crouched position.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
