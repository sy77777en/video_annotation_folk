    "pre_caption": "In a wide, low-angle fisheye shot, a skateboarder begins in the center middle ground, moving towards the left. A large trash can is positioned in the bottom left foreground, and a statue on a concrete base is visible in the right middle ground, with a long, arched building spanning the background. The skateboarder jumps into the air, moving from the middle ground towards the foreground and passing over the trash can. At the peak of the jump, he is suspended in the center of the frame before landing and exiting the shot to the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with short dark hair and some facial hair is captured in action on a skateboard. He is wearing a dark grey t-shirt, light-colored baggy pants, and white sneakers. Initially, he rides his skateboard on a platform with three steps, his body slightly bent and his arms relaxed at his sides. As he approaches the edge of the platform, he spreads his arms and launches himself into the air, successfully clearing a dark green, cylindrical trash can with stickers on it, one of which shows a close-up of an eye. He then lands smoothly and continues to skate forward. To the right, a dark, weathered statue of a person stands on a large concrete base that has graffiti on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a level camera angle, capturing a spacious, open-air European plaza during the daytime. A long, multi-story building with a classical facade of repeating arches and windows forms the background under a bright, overcast sky. In the mid-ground to the right, a large gray stone monument base with a statue on top is visible. As a person on a skateboard launches into the air, the camera shifts to a low-angle perspective, capturing them mid-jump over a dark green, cylindrical trash can with stickers on its surface, positioned at the base of concrete steps. Once the skateboarder lands and skates off to the left, the camera reverts to a level angle, revealing more of the mid-ground European-style open square, the multi-story buildings in the background, and the trash can in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
