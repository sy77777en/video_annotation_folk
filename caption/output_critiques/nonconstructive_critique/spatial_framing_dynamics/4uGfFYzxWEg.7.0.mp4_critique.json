    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, showing a humanoid figure from the waist up, centered in the frame and occupying the middle ground. This figure initially faces slightly to the right, then turns to face the camera directly. A glowing white waveform is positioned in the background, stretching horizontally across the center of the frame behind the figure. Text \"ITV - Major Fraud (2003)\" is statically displayed in the bottom left corner in the foreground, while subtitles appear sequentially in the bottom center, also in the foreground. The shot then zooms in to a medium close-up, focusing on the figure's upper body and head, which remains centered in the middle ground. Subsequently, the view zooms back out to the initial medium shot, with the figure still centered in the middle ground and facing forward. The camera maintains a position at the subject's level throughout these transitions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the video, a stylized humanoid figure, resembling a man, is shown from the waist up. Rendered in a low-polygon style, the figure has a gold or brass-colored appearance and lacks distinct facial features, though it possesses the general form of a human head and torso. It wears what looks like a collared shirt, constructed from the same geometric shapes and material. The humanoid is depicted holding a dark, rectangular object, presumably a phone, to its left ear with its left hand, while its right arm is positioned down by its side. Initially, the figure faces slightly towards the right side of the frame, then gradually turns to face the camera. The shot transitions from a medium view to a tighter medium close-up on the figure's upper body and head, before zooming back out to the initial medium shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-poly, golden-colored humanoid figure is depicted from the chest up, holding a dark, rectangular object to its ear, resembling a phone. The figure is set against a dark, textured background. In the lower middle part of the scene, an audio visualization pattern, consisting of a horizontal, glowing white waveform with vertical bars of varying heights, continuously changes to represent audio characteristics such as frequency and intensity against a dark brown background. White text overlays appear at the bottom: \"ITV - Major Fraud (2003)\" is in the bottom left corner, while subtitles like \"I have to tell you that these suspicions\", \"have been referred to the police.\", \"Right.\", \"And thus we [will] not for\", and \"the moment will be airing the program\" appear sequentially in the bottom center.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a humanoid subject answering a phone call. The shot size transitions from a medium shot to a medium close-up shot before returning to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
