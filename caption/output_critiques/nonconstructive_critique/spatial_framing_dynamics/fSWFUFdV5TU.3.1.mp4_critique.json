    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a dark wooden door, positioned centrally in the frame, with light seeping through its edges. The door is in the middle ground, with the surrounding walls in the background. As the camera zooms out, the shot transitions to a wide shot, revealing more of the room's interior. On the left, a side table with a lamp, a framed photo, and a bowl becomes visible, positioned in the foreground. Above the table, a framed picture is mounted on the wall in the background. To the right of the door, a larger framed artwork is visible on the wall, also in the background. In the lower right corner, a potted plant appears in the foreground. The camera is positioned at a height level with the door, maintaining a straight-on view throughout the zoom-out transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the interior scenery of a dimly lit room, focusing on the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific subject. The composition features a dark wooden door with a sliver of light visible through its crack, flanked by a wall with a light switch, a framed picture, and a side table holding a lamp, a framed photo, and a bowl. To the right of the door, a larger framed artwork hangs on the wall. The camera dynamically zooms out to include the table and lamp on the left, as well as a potted plant in the lower right corner, enhancing the mood and sense of place, with the setting itself as the primary point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor scene focused on a closed, dark wooden door featuring a silver doorknob and a peephole, with light seeping around its edges from another area. The surrounding walls are light-colored. To the left of the door, a double light switch is visible. As the camera moves backward, a dark wooden side table comes into view in the lower left, displaying a red patterned object, a small framed photo, and a green bowl, while a shoe rack and a potted plant appears in the lower right corner. On the right wall hangs a larger, vertically oriented framed artwork containing a predominantly red and dark pattern. In the lower right corner, part of a shoe rack can be seen. The overall lighting is quite dim, making it difficult to determine whether it is daytime or nighttime.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
