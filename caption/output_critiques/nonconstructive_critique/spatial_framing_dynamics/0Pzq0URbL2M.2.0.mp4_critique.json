    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a large tombstone in the center foreground, with its base and the surrounding grass occupying the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground and background, numerous other tombstones are silhouetted across the scene. A small, bright orb of light is positioned in the background, slightly to the right of the center on the horizon, while the dusky sky fills the top portion of the frame. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark, weathered tombstone with a rounded top stands in the foreground, silhouetted against a dusky, purple-hued sky. The stone has a rough texture, and a small, broken piece rests at its base in the grass. In the hazy background, numerous other tombstones are visible as dark silhouettes, with a small, bright orb of light low on the horizon behind them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set in a cemetery at dusk. In the foreground, a large, weathered stone tombstone with a rounded top is silhouetted against a dark purple sky. The ground is covered in grass, and in the hazy background, numerous other tombstones are visible as dark shapes. A small, bright orb hangs low on the horizon. The tombstone in the foreground has a rough texture and is slightly broken at its base.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
