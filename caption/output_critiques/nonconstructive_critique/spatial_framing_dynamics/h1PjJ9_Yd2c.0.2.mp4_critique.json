    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, featuring a young woman in the top right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground as she walks down a set of concrete stairs. As she descends and then moves left onto a grassy area in the foreground, the shot transitions to a full shot, with the woman moving towards the center-left of the frame. The stairs are located on the right, in the middle ground, and the grassy area occupies the bottom foreground. A tiered seating structure spans the background from the center to the right. A tree is positioned on the left, extending from the middle ground to the background, and a building with windows is visible in the far-left background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with long, dark brown hair tied in a ponytail walks down a set of outdoor concrete stairs and then onto a grassy area. She is wearing a grey short-sleeved t-shirt, black shorts, and black and white sneakers. She carries a black bag slung over her right shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene at what appears to be a sports facility, possibly a tennis club or stadium, under an overcast sky. A young woman with long dark hair, wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts, and carrying a black bag, walks down a set of concrete stairs. The stairs have a white metal railing on one side and lead down to a sloping grassy area. In the background, there is a tiered seating structure with a primarily gray facade and a small section of green, topped by a large, covered roof supported by metal beams. Part of a building with large windows is visible further in the background, and a tall tree on the left side of the frame. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by greens and greys.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
