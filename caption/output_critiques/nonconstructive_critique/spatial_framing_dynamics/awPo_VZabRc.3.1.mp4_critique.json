    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a man and a woman at a bar counter from the man's eye level. A woman, with her back to the camera, is positioned in the left foreground. Opposite her, a man sits in the right middle ground. A bar counter stretches across the scene, with a pile of crumpled items in the center middle ground between the two figures, a small glass directly in front of the man, and a pink purse to his right. The background shows the dimly lit interior of the bar. The camera remains static as the woman gestures and then takes an item from the man's hand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a thin man with pale skin, dark messy hair, and dark circles under his eyes, who is sitting at a bar counter. He wears a black jacket over a white t-shirt and has a small glass in front of him. Interacting with him is a woman, seen from the back, who has dark hair tied up in a ponytail. She is wearing a white tank top and dark pants with a red belt, and has a large, intricate tattoo covering her right arm and another tattoo on her lower back. On the counter between them is a pile of what appears to be crumpled money and a small pink purse. The woman gestures toward the man and takes something from his hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated scene is set indoors at a dimly lit bar, cast in a reddish glow. The back wall is green-painted on the bottom and red at the top, adorned with a framed picture. A few empty tables are scattered around. At the bottom of the frame, a dark bar counter displays a pile of crumpled cash, some litter, a small shot glass, and a pink wallet. A woman with tattoos on her arm and lower back stands with her back to the viewer, while a man in a black jacket sits opposite her at the counter.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
