    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, moving rapidly forward along a sharp mountain ridge that extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, a bright sun and a body of water are visible on the left, with rolling hills occupying the middle ground on both sides. As the camera advances, the shot becomes a wide shot, revealing a person standing at the mountain's peak in the center of the frame. The camera, positioned above the subject, then moves quickly toward and around the person, who is now in the foreground, executing a fast, spinning motion that shifts the view to look down from the summit at the surrounding landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a fast-moving aerial shot flying along the sharp ridge of a reddish-brown mountain. As the camera moves forward toward the peak against a bright sun, a lone figure is revealed standing at the summit. The camera then quickly moves toward and around this person, showing a man wearing a bright red jacket with a yellow hood or hat and green or brown pants. A backpack is visible on the ground near him as he stands on the mountaintop.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight along the sharp, dark-red ridge of a mountain during sunrise or sunset. The low sun casts a golden glow across a vast landscape of rolling, brown hills, with a large body of water visible in the distance under a partly cloudy sky. The drone moves forward to reveal a lone person standing on the mountain's peak, and the perspective then shifts to a rapid, spinning view from the summit looking down at the rugged terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
