    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a close-up shot of a child's head, positioned primarily in the center and left of the frame in the middle ground against a dark, undefined background. The child's hand repeatedly moves from the bottom of the frame into the extreme foreground, becoming a large, out-of-focus shape that intermittently obscures the view of the child's face. Simultaneously, the child's head shifts and turns within the middle ground, causing different parts of their face to be illuminated. The camera remains at the child's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a grainy, black-and-white close-up, the head of a child is partially illuminated against a dark background. The child has dark, short hair, and their face is mostly obscured by shadow. As they look down and around, the sparse light reveals glimpses of their features, including their nose, mouth, and an eye. The child's hand frequently moves into the frame, very close to the camera, at times completely blocking the view of their face before it is revealed again.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a grainy, black-and-white scene set against a completely dark background, a dim light intermittently reveals parts of a person's face. The shifting illumination suggests either the light source or the person is moving, creating fleeting glimpses of facial features before the scene returns to near-total darkness.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up of a child searching for something, with the camera positioned in front of the child, capturing their head. As the child’s hand moves very close to the camera, it occasionally blocks the view, causing the child to be hidden at times, while at other moments, they are visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
