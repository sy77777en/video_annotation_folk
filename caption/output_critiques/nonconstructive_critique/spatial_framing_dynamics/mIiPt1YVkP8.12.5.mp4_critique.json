    "pre_caption": "Initially, the frame shows a pilot from the shoulders up, positioned in the left and center middle ground, looking towards the camera. To his right, also in the middle ground, is an image of an aircraft cockpit. Text and a food image occupy the top right background, while desk items are visible in the bottom left foreground/middle ground. The camera then tilts downwards and appears to zoom out slightly. This movement reveals a large illustration of a KLM airplane occupying the entire bottom foreground, stretching from left to right. The pilot and cockpit remain visible in the upper left/center and upper right/center middle ground, respectively, now smaller within the overall composition. The background elements in the top right and the desk items in the bottom left remain partially visible. The camera perspective starts slightly above the pilot's eye level and moves lower as it tilts down.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a digitally crafted composition resembling a magazine layout, featuring a man in a pilot's uniform with a white shirt and black epaulets with gold stripes, smiling and facing the camera. He has light skin and gray hair, and is positioned near an aircraft cockpit with visible dials and controls. Adjacent to him is an artfully integrated image of a large airplane, predominantly teal with a white underbelly, displaying the KLM logo and the text \"The reliable airline of those surprising Dutch.\" The scene creatively blends elements of aviation and advertising, with the pilot and the aircraft as central subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an indoor aviation-themed setting, beginning with a close-up of a pilot in uniform. It smoothly transitions to a detailed view of the cockpit's intricate controls and dials, characterized by their metallic and textured surfaces. The scene then highlights a KLM airplane illustration in front of the pilot, emphasizing its sleek design and distinctive blue and white color scheme. The background features a blend of images and text, creating a cohesive and engaging composition that underscores the airline's branding and imagery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
