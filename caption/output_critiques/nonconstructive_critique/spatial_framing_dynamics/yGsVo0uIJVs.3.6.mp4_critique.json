    "pre_caption": "The video shows a medium shot of a light gray claw machine, centered in the foreground. Inside, a mechanical claw, initially holding a piece of wood, is in the upper-center (middle ground) of the prize area. A white stuffed rabbit is positioned below it in the center-left (middle ground), with two other partially visible white stuffed animals to the right (middle ground). The claw descends and moves to the bottom left (middle ground) of the prize area, releases the wood, and then remains static in this bottom left position. A joystick and buttons are on the machine's front panel in the bottom center (foreground). The camera is at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a light gray, upright claw machine, characteristic of an arcade game, with a large glass window on its front. Inside the machine, a white, three-pronged mechanical claw is initially holding an elongated, dark brown, rough-textured piece of wood. Below the claw, in the prize area, sits a white stuffed rabbit with long ears, facing forward. In front and to the right of this rabbit, near the lower right corner of the claw machine, another white, rounded stuffed animal is partially visible from the back. A small portion of a third white stuffed animal can be seen further to the right, near the machine's side. The video shows the claw moving from the center of the prize area to the lower left corner before releasing the piece of wood, which then falls. The claw remains static above the opening in the lower left corner. The front panel of the claw machine features a joystick and what appear to be buttons.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a light gray, vintage-style claw machine positioned against a dark, featureless background. Through its glass front, the interior reveals a white, three-pronged claw. Initially, this claw holds a dark brown, rough-textured log, which is subsequently released. Inside the machine, a white, soft-looking stuffed bunny is almost fully visible in the upper left corner, while two other white stuffed toys are partially visible on the right side. The front panel of the arcade machine is equipped with a joystick and control buttons. The scene is characterized by a monochromatic and minimalist aesthetic.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
