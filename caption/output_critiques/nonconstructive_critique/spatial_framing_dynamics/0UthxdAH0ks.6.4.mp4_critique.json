    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a young man seated at a table, capturing him from the chest up. Positioned centrally in the frame, he occupies the middle ground, with his face and upper body clearly visible. To his left and right, other hands holding chopsticks appear intermittently, indicating the presence of additional diners who remain partially out of view. These hands move into and out of the foreground, interacting with the food on the table. Two table lamps with white, scalloped shades are situated on either side of the frame, one on the left and one on the right, providing soft illumination. The background consists of a red wall, adding depth to the scene. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level throughout the video, keeping the young man as the focal point while subtly capturing the dynamic hand movements around him. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, ensuring consistent spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with short black hair and a medium skin tone, wearing a dark-colored shirt. He is seated at a table, and although his hands are out of the frame and not visible, he appears to be part of a dining setting. His expression is neutral, looking at the food in front of him. The setting is dimly lit, with a warm ambiance created by nearby lamps. Other hands holding chopsticks are visible, suggesting he is dining with others, but they are not fully visible. The focus remains on the young man as he observes the meal.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a dimly lit restaurant or dining room, characterized by a warm, intimate atmosphere. The lighting is soft, emanating from two table lamps with white, scalloped shades, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The environment features a dark, rich color palette with deep reds and browns, including a red wall in the background, contributing to the cozy ambiance. A group of people is gathered around a table, engaged in a meal, suggesting a shared dining experience. While some diners are using chopsticks, the main subject is not. The overall scene conveys a sense of communal dining.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
