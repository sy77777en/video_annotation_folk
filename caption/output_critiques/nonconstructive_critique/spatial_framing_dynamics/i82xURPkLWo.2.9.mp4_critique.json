    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioned at eye level with the bonsai trees. A deciduous bonsai sits in the left foreground, while a juniper bonsai is in the center middle ground, and the trunk of a third bonsai is on the right middle ground. The background consists of a blurry landscape. The camera then tilts upward, causing the bonsai trees to shift toward the bottom of the frame. The movement stops to reveal the upper body of a man in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of center, with the top of the juniper bonsai remaining visible in the bottom center foreground. The background now shows more of the surrounding trees and a wooden structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a medium shot of three bonsai trees. The first bonsai tree on the left has a lush, green canopy with a slightly twisted trunk, planted in a rectangular pot with moss. The second bonsai tree in the middle has dense, dark green foliage with a more intricate trunk structure, placed in a similar pot with visible soil and pebbles. The third bonsai tree on the right is partially visible, adding depth to the scene. As the camera moves upward, the tops of the trees are revealed, showcasing their detailed branches and leaves. Eventually, the bonsai trees nearly move out of the frame, and the upper body of a man appears in the middle ground. He is wearing a red T-shirt and has a short hairstyle, positioned slightly to the right, facing upward with a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in an activity or observing something above. The background includes wooden structures and trees, adding a natural setting to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting, several bonsai trees rest on a wooden surface. The foreground prominently features a deciduous bonsai with a thick, gnarled trunk and small green leaves, sitting in a dark rectangular pot. To the left, two bonsai trees with small green leaves add to the scene. The background, seen past a wooden railing, is a blurred natural landscape of trees and open land under an overcast sky. The camera moves upward to reveal a person in a reddish-brown shirt working on a wooden structure.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot focused on the base of two bonsai trees. The camera then moves upward to reveal the tops of the trees. As the camera continues to move up, the bonsai trees nearly move out of the frame. Finally, the upper body of a man in red T-shirt appears in the background.",
