    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective, with the weapon and gloved hands consistently occupying the lower center and foreground of the frame. In the initial scene, a large, gold-framed portrait is positioned on the left side of the frame and middle ground, mounted on the wall above a bench, while a bright room with sofas and a door appears on the right side and extends into the background. The patterned floor and decorative wallpaper are visible throughout the foreground and middle ground. As the individual moves forward, the camera shifts through a doorway at the center, transitioning into a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring, which occupies the middle ground and leads deeper into the background. The camera remains at the subject’s eye level, maintaining a consistent height relative to the weapon and hands. Overlay elements, such as the compass, objective text, and weapon status, are fixed at the top and bottom of the frame and do not interact with the physical space. The spatial framing emphasizes forward movement through connected interior spaces, with the main elements—weapon, portrait, and corridor—shifting from left and right positions in the frame to a central alignment as the scene progresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a first-person perspective of an individual holding a black assault rifle with a visible ammunition counter, moving through an indoor environment. The person’s hands, covered by tactical gloves, grip the weapon. A large, framed portrait of a man in a military uniform with a mustache and medals is prominently displayed on a wall. In another area, a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring is visible, and an on-screen objective text instructs to \"Escape through the north-side tunnel.\" No other people or animals are clearly visible, and the focus remains on the weapon, the portrait, and the interior spaces navigated by the armed individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins in a bright hallway featuring patterned floors, carpet, and decorative wallpaper. A large, gold-framed portrait of a uniformed figure is prominently displayed on the left wall. To the right, a brighter area with several sofas and a wood-paneled door is visible. A narrow, dimly lit hallway connects these spaces, leading the character into a dimly lit room that resembles a kitchen or storage area. This room contains shelves on the right, cabinets in the center, and various items scattered across the countertops and floor. Overlay elements include a compass and direction indicator at the top, mission instructions below, a white location icon beneath that, and weapon status information in the lower right corner. The mission objective text overlay reads “Escape through the north-side tunnel.” These overlays are superimposed on the video for informational purposes and are not part of the physical environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
