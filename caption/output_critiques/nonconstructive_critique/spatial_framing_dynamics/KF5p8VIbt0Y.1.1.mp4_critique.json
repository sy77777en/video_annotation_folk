    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, showing a rooftop set in the foreground and middle ground. A man is positioned in the center-left of the frame, in the middle ground, on a structure attached to a building facade, while a distant city street occupies the background on the right. A temporary cyan geometric overlay is superimposed over the man and the structure. The shot then changes to a wide shot, with the camera now positioned at the man's level. In this new framing, the man becomes the central subject, hanging and swinging in the middle ground, with the building facade to his left and the background street still visible to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black and white video, a man with dark hair, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a dark tie, appears to be hanging from the hands of a large clock face. The clock is seemingly mounted on the exterior wall of a tall building, high above a city street. However, this dramatic scene is an illusion created by a set constructed on the roof of a tall building. The man clings to the clock's hands with both of his hands, his body suspended in the air with his legs dangling below him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A monochromatic, daytime scene is set on a city rooftop, overlooking a busy street with early 20th-century traffic. In the background, multi-story buildings line the street, one of which has a sign that reads \"ABSOLUTELY FIRE-PROOF.\" The rooftop in the foreground contains a small, two-tiered metal platform. A man is seen hanging from the hands of a large clock face on the side of an adjacent building. A cyan-colored geometric overlay, forming a rectangle and triangles, is temporarily superimposed on the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
