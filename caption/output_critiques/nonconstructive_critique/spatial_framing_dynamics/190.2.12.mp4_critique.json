    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of two men standing side by side outdoors at night. The man on the left is wearing a dark jacket over a striped shirt and has short hair, appearing to look slightly upward. The man on the right is wearing glasses, a dark jacket, and a brown sweater, with a goatee and short hair, facing forward. Both men are positioned closely together, suggesting they are engaged in a shared experience or conversation. The background consists of an urban setting with dimly lit buildings and trees, creating a subdued atmosphere. The lighting is soft, with a few artificial lights illuminating parts of the scene, casting subtle reflections on nearby surfaces. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by dark tones. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent level with the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men sitting side by side. The man on the left is wearing a dark jacket over a striped shirt and has short hair. He appears to be looking slightly upward. The man on the right is wearing glasses, a dark jacket, and a brown sweater. He has a goatee and short hair, and he is facing forward. Both men are positioned closely together, suggesting they are engaged in a shared experience or conversation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban setting at night, characterized by dim lighting and a subdued atmosphere. The scene features a street lined with buildings, partially obscured by shadows. Trees with dark silhouettes, softened by the dim light, add a natural element to the environment. The lighting is soft, with a few artificial lights illuminating parts of the scene, creating subtle reflections on nearby surfaces. The overall color palette is muted, with dark tones dominating the visual elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
