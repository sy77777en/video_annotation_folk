    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot capturing the passenger boat from above and behind, placing the boat in the middle ground of the frame. The boat occupies a small portion of the frame, emphasizing the expansive river and surrounding landscape. The camera is positioned high above the boat, offering a broad view of the river's width and the lush greenery on either side. As the video progresses, the camera arcs around the boat, gradually descending in altitude. This transition shifts the perspective from an overhead view to a more direct frontal angle. By the end of the video, the shot size changes to a wide shot, with the camera now at the boat's level, focusing on the bow where a person is seated. The boat moves closer to the center of the frame, with the person at the bow positioned slightly to the right. The surrounding river and banks remain visible in the background, maintaining the natural setting. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a smooth movement, transitioning from an elevated position above the boat to a level position alongside it, enhancing the viewer's engagement with the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a passenger boat navigating a river. Initially, it is captured in an extreme wide shot from above and behind, highlighting the boat's position on the river. As the camera arcs around and descends, the focus shifts to a wide shot from the front, revealing the boat's bow. Seated at the bow is a person dressed in a gray-white short-sleeve shirt and dark-colored pants. The river is flanked by lush greenery and a sandy bank, providing a natural backdrop to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a serene outdoor setting along a wide river. The scene unfolds during the day under a clear sky with minimal clouds, with sunlight reflecting off the water's surface. The river is flanked by lush green forests and a rocky, sandy bank on both sides, creating a natural and tranquil environment. A long, narrow boat navigates the river, adding a sense of motion and exploration to the scene. The surrounding landscape features distant hills and a gentle flow of the river, emphasizing the vastness and calmness of the area. The drone's perspective provides a sweeping view of the river's path and the encompassing natural beauty.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a passenger boat on a river. It begins with an extreme wide shot from above and behind the boat. The camera then arcs around it while descending in altitude. The video ends with a wide shot from the front, showing the boat’s bow and a person seated there.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
