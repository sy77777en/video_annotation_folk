    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle full shot of a motorcycle and rider positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground on a racetrack. The camera tracks the subject as it performs a wheelie while moving across the frame. The shot then transitions from slow motion to normal speed as the camera tilts up, changing the framing to a wide shot. This movement repositions the main rider to the bottom center of the screen in the foreground, while a second rider becomes visible in the distant background at the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is riding a racing motorcycle on a track. He is wearing a full set of racing gear, including a blue, white, and red suit with \"alpinestars\" branding, a matching helmet with red, white, and blue graphics, and black and white boots and gloves. The motorcycle is also blue, red, and white, and is covered in sponsor decals, with \"APEX\" written in large white letters with a red background on the side fairing, along with \"ClickCease,\" \"Snap-on,\" \"DRIVEN,\" \"GDH,\" \"ITR,\" \"ethika,\" \"DUNLOP,\" \"powered by TRIUMPH,\" \"DELL technologies,\" and several other indistinguishable brandings. There is also a prominent branding in the center of the bike with the text \"AMERICAN RACING,\" along with a smaller one that reads \"AMERICAN RACING ACADEMY.\" The rider is leaning low into a turn and gradually stops leaning at one point. By the end of the video, the camera stops the slow motion and tilts up, revealing another rider in the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a banked turn on a paved racetrack situated in a sandy area. The dark asphalt surface is bordered by a yellow and black curb along the outer edge of the turn. The scene takes place on a bright, sunny day, which casts a distinct shadow on the track. A single blue, red, and white racing motorcycle, with its rider, is on the track, gradually stopping its lean as it accelerates. The camera then tilts up, tracking the main subject and revealing another rider in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
