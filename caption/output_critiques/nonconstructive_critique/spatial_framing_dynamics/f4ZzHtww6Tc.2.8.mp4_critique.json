    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a man crouching on light blue-grey concrete steps, positioned in the left-center foreground. These steps are part of a red brick house with white porch columns and a balustrade, which occupies the middle ground, extending from the center to the right side of the frame. A black metal handrail is visible in the middle ground, running from the left along a sloped grassy area towards the center-right. Green tree leaves are in the extreme foreground, partially framing the top and left edges of the scene, while a tree trunk stands in the middle ground, right of center. The man jumps from the steps onto the handrail, grinding from left to right across the center of the frame, remaining in the middle ground and initially maintaining the full shot. The camera pans to the right, tracking his movement. As he lands on the concrete sidewalk in the foreground and skates further to the right, the shot dynamically transitions to a medium close-up of him. Consequently, the house and porch shift to the right and into the background, while the sidewalk becomes prominent in the bottom foreground. Throughout this sequence, other houses, parked cars, and trees form the distant background, and the camera maintains a height level with the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a man with light skin and visible tattoos on his arms and neck, who enters the frame skateboarding. He wears a tan short-sleeved button-up shirt, dark blue cuffed jeans, white sneakers, and a black baseball cap. The camera tracks him as he performs a trick, jumping onto a railing and then back to the ground, with the view of him transitioning from a full shot to a medium close-up as the video progresses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is an objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. It is set outdoors in a sunlit residential neighborhood where a red brick house with white porch columns and a white balustrade is prominent, featuring light blue-grey concrete steps to one side. Adjacent to the house, a sloped grassy area with two clusters of yellow flowers descends towards a concrete sidewalk. A black metal handrail lines the edge of this grassy incline. Beyond the sidewalk, an asphalt street with parked cars, other houses, and green trees form the background. Green tree leaves are visible in the foreground, partially framing the scene where a skateboarder moves along the handrail and onto the sidewalk.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a man skateboarding in a tree-lined urban area, jumping onto a railing and then back to the ground. In the beginning, the frame only shows a small part of the cityscape. The man then enters the frame, and the camera tracks his movements, dynamically changing the shot size from a full shot when he first appears to a medium close-up by the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
