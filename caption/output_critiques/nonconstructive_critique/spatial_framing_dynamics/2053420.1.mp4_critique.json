    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a dynamic road journey, capturing the expansive scenery throughout. Initially, the camera frames a broad highway stretching into the horizon, occupying the center of the frame. The road is flanked by lush greenery on both sides, positioned in the foreground and middle ground, while the sky, filled with vibrant sunset hues, dominates the upper portion of the frame. As the vehicle moves forward, other cars appear intermittently on the left and right sides of the frame, some closer in the middle ground and others further back in the background. The camera maintains a consistent height, aligned with the road level, providing a driver's perspective. \n\nThe scene transitions smoothly as the road narrows and becomes lined with trees, shifting the focus to a more enclosed space. The trees now occupy a larger portion of the frame on both sides, creating a corridor-like effect. The road markings and occasional streetlights become more prominent in the foreground, guiding the viewer's eye along the path. The sky remains visible above, though partially obscured by the tree canopy. The camera continues to move steadily forward, maintaining its alignment with the road's direction.\n\nAs the drive progresses, the environment shifts again, introducing urban elements such as buildings and street signs, which appear in the middle and",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a dynamic road scenery shot, capturing the overall driving experience. It begins with an open highway under a wide sky, featuring a sunset with vibrant clouds that emphasize the vastness and openness of the road. As the drive continues, the scene transitions seamlessly from a highway to a tree-lined street within the town, with blurred lights suggesting speed and motion. The focus is on the atmosphere and the experience of travel, highlighting the continuous flow of the drive.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting transitioning from a highway to a tree-lined road. Initially, the scene features a wide highway with smooth, dark asphalt, bordered by dense greenery on both sides. The sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting early evening as the sun sets, casting a warm glow. Numerous cars, including a visible truck, are passing by on both sides or being overtaken. The scene transitions to a narrower road enveloped by trees, with blurred motion indicating speed. Streetlights begin to illuminate, hinting at the onset of dusk. The environment briefly shifts to an enclosed segment under a tunnel, but the majority of the scene remains outdoors, with the natural elements of trees and artificial lighting creating a contrasting atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
