    "pre_caption": "The video is a medium shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, the main subject in a yellow and green jersey occupies the center-left foreground, facing slightly towards the right. To his immediate right in the foreground is another man in a white t-shirt. The middle ground, extending from the center to the right, contains several other individuals, with red rock formations and a distant hillside populated with more people forming the background. The main subject then turns his body to his left, shifting slightly towards the center of the foreground. Subsequently, a woman in a blue jacket and another man enter the frame from the left, positioning themselves in the left foreground as they interact with the main subject. Sparse bushes and dusty, light brown earth are visible across the foreground and middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a light-skinned man with short, dark brown hair, a short beard, and tattoos on his left forearm, wearing a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey with a large green \"tld\" logo and matching yellow shorts; he also has a pair of red, white, and blue goggles with text, worn backward around his neck. He is interacting with several other people. To his left, a light-skinned man with sunglasses wears a white t-shirt with a black graphic, light-colored shorts, a black baseball cap worn backward, and a gray wrist brace, smiling towards the main subject. A light-skinned woman with blonde hair, wearing a bright blue zip-up jacket over a black top and a white knit beanie, appears to be speaking and gesturing towards the main subject. Nearby, a light-skinned man in a black t-shirt, a black baseball cap, and a black backpack looks on. Further in the mid-ground, other individuals include a man in a green long-sleeved shirt and a yellow cap, possibly holding a camera, and another man in a bright green long-sleeved shirt and dark shorts. Many other people are visible in the distant background on a hillside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in an arid, rocky landscape during the daytime, characterized by prominent red rock formations and hills in the background, upon which distant figures can be seen. The foreground and mid-ground consist of dusty, light brown earth interspersed with sparse, low-lying green and brown bushes. Several people, dressed in casual outdoor or athletic clothing, are present. A man in a bright yellow and green long-sleeved jersey is noticeable as he turns and interacts with a woman in a blue jacket and a white beanie. Other individuals are visible further back, standing or moving slightly. The sky above is partly cloudy, revealing patches of blue.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
