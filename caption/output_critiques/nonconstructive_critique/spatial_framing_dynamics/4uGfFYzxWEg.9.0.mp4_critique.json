    "pre_caption": "The scene displays a static graphic composition. Text is positioned in the top center foreground. A bar chart occupies the center middle ground, featuring a y-axis label on its left and an x-axis label below it at the bottom center, both in the middle ground. The chart's title is situated top center above the bars, also in the middle ground. A red vertical line is positioned towards the right side of the chart's main distribution peak, within the middle ground. Further text resides in the bottom center foreground, while a watermark is located in the bottom left foreground. There are no changes in the spatial arrangement of these elements during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bar chart displaying a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. A red vertical line is present, indicating a specific data point of interest. The chart is titled \"Simulations assuming half of all coughs are Whitlock,\" suggesting a statistical analysis. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is a screen capture featuring a black bar chart against a white background. The chart displays data related to simulations of coughs, with the x-axis labeled for coughs during specific periods and the y-axis indicating the number of simulations. A red vertical line marks a specific data point on the chart. The environment is minimalistic, emphasizing the chart's details. Overlay elements include text in the bottom left corner that reads, \"Liam Shaw - A Statistical Analysis of Coughing Patterns on 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' (2020),\" along with a title and watermark at the bottom, indicating the source and topic of the analysis. The overall scene is static, with no visible changes in time or motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
