    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a Japanese suburban street. Initially, the frame shows a wet road in the middle ground, with a large tree in the left foreground and modern houses in the middle ground on the right. A white van is visible driving from right to left across the middle ground. The camera, positioned at eye level, then pans to the left, shifting the perspective to a sidewalk. In the final composition, the sidewalk occupies the left foreground, while a vibrant flowerbed fills the bottom right foreground. The road now curves away into the background, leading the eye toward distant houses and a large, netted structure in the center background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a quiet, suburban streetscape scenery shot in Japan on a rainy, overcast day. The camera pans across a wet asphalt road flanked by modern Japanese homes and a commercial building, featuring a mix of white stucco walls and dark, angled roofs. Abundant, vibrant greenery, including trees, manicured hedges, and lush flowerbeds with bright yellow and purple blossoms, glistens from the rain. A prominent palm tree stands near one of the buildings, while numerous utility poles with a web of wires and a large, netted structure, likely a driving range, are visible in the background. Cars driving along the road and parked on the side add to the dynamic yet serene atmosphere of the suburban streetscape. The scene lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall tranquil atmosphere and the meticulously landscaped environment of the neighborhood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person point of view, the scene captures a quiet, modern Japanese residential street on a cloudy, rainy day. The camera pans left along a paved sidewalk, which is flanked by a vibrant garden strip of green foliage, yellow flowers, and purple blossoms. The asphalt road is wet, reflecting the overcast sky. Across the street, contemporary houses with clean architectural lines are set amongst lush trees, including a prominent palm tree. A white van is seen driving down the road, while other cars are parked in the yards of the houses. In the background, numerous utility poles and wires are visible, along with the tall, white netting of a large structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
