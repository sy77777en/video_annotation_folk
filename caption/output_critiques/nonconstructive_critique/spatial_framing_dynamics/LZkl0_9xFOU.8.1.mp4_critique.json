    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the main subject, a humanoid figure in a tie-dye t-shirt, positioned slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground, facing a black computer monitor located to their right, also in the middle ground. To the left in the background, a blurred figure is visible from the chest down. Further in the background on the right, a silhouetted figure stands. A blurred element, possibly a computer tower, occupies the bottom foreground. White text reading \"Nathan Leroux\" is initially present in the bottom right foreground and gradually disappears. The camera is positioned at the main subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video centers on a humanoid figure with a featureless white face, lacking eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and short, dark gray, side-swept hair. This figure is seated and appears to be interacting with a black computer monitor. The main subject is wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt with a vibrant tie-dye pattern displaying swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink. In the middle ground to the left, another humanoid figure stands with arms akimbo, visible only from the chest down, wearing a light-colored, possibly gray, top and light-colored jeans. Further in the background to the right, a more indistinct, silhouetted humanoid figure is also present. White text overlay reading \"Nathan Leroux\" is visible in the bottom right corner, gradually disappearing in a dynamic and visually appealing manner as the video progresses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor scene, likely an office or workspace, characterized by dim, cool-toned artificial lighting. A faceless mannequin-like figure with short, dark hair featuring a lighter streak, wearing a tie-dye t-shirt with swirls of blue, green, yellow, orange, and pink, is seated at a desk. This figure faces a black computer monitor that is prominent on the right side of the view. In the middle ground, a figure in light-colored pants and a light top stands to the left, and a figure wearing a dark blue top is visible further back on the right. A potted plant and a shelf are also discernible in the background. An overlay text \"Nathan LerouX\" in white is present in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
