    "pre_caption": "The video's framing of the main subject is dynamic, beginning with a medium-full shot of him entering from the right in the middle ground and moving behind another person seated in the left foreground. Following a brief cut, the subject is repositioned in a medium shot in the center middle ground, with a building visible in the background. The scene then transitions to a full shot that tracks the subject from right to left across the middle ground as he skateboards. The camera follows him as he jumps down a set of stairs in the center, with a tree briefly passing through the right foreground. The sequence ends with a medium-full shot of the subject from behind in the middle ground, moving toward the right side of the frame past a car. Throughout the video, pedestrians and traffic occupy the middle ground and background, and the camera remains at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light brown skin as the main subject. He is wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt with a small graphic on the chest, light blue jeans held up by a black belt, and white high-top sneakers. He accessorizes with a silver chain necklace and a red baseball cap worn forward, which has a white logo on the front. Throughout the video, he is seen skateboarding over a bench, skating on a city sidewalk, and jumping down a small set of stairs on his skateboard. He is also shown skating past a black SUV.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A sunlit urban plaza is situated next to a busy city street, with a prominent building in the background featuring the words \"HOTEL GEORGIA\" in large, gold-colored letters. The public square is furnished with red metal chairs and brown wooden benches, interspersed with small trees. A skateboarder navigates the paved area, moving past a blue, black, and yellow recycling bin and down a short flight of concrete stairs in the middle ground. Some trunks and aman wears black shirt with hat sit on the chair in the foreground,watching the man skating.Pedestrians stroll through the scene, while a black SUV, a yellow taxi, and other cars stop along the adjacent road.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
