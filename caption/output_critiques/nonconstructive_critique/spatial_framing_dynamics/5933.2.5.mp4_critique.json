    "pre_caption": "This extreme close-up shot focuses on a pair of hands in the foreground. The left hand, positioned on the left side of the frame, holds a pen. The right hand is visible at the bottom right, holding a small notepad that occupies the center-right foreground. The pen is actively drawing on the notepad in the center-right foreground, its tip moving across the paper to create a sketch. The background is blurred and indistinct. The hands and notepad remain relatively static in their position, while the pen moves to add detail to the drawing. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a person's hands holding a small notepad and sketching with a pen. The hands have a light skin tone and are focused on drawing a detailed sketch of a lighthouse on the notepad. The sketch includes the lighthouse structure with surrounding lines indicating the landscape or additional features. The pen is actively moving, suggesting the drawing is in progress. The notepad is spiral-bound at the top, and the scene emphasizes the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting during daylight, featuring a close-up view of a hand sketching on a small notepad. The notepad is held by another hand, and the sketch depicts a simple structure, possibly a building or tower, drawn with a dark pen. The background is blurred, suggesting a natural environment, possibly with earthy tones. The focus remains on the notepad and the sketching process, highlighting the texture of the paper and the movement of the pen. The scene maintains a neutral, observational perspective, emphasizing the act of drawing in a serene outdoor setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
