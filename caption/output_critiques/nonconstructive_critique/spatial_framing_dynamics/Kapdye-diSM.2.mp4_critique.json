    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a red Land Rover is positioned diagonally in the center-left foreground, next to a large stone building that occupies the left side of the frame. The street fills the bottom half of the frame, while other parked cars and buildings are visible in the middle ground and background on the right. A logo is stationary in the bottom right corner. The camera, positioned at the vehicle's level, moves slowly forward and slightly to the right, causing the Land Rover to shift toward the left edge of the frame as the perspective pans along its side.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red, two-door Land Rover Defender is parked on a city street. The vehicle has a white roof and a large, black metal roof rack. Secured to the rack is a grey, covered, rectangular item, likely a rooftop tent, and several round spotlights are mounted on the front of the rack. A black snorkel runs up the A-pillar on the vehicle's right side, and a black-covered spare tire is mounted on the hood. The lower section of the vehicle's body is silver, and it is fitted with white wheels and thick, off-road tires. In the further scene, several other cars are parked along the street, including a white van, a white sedan, and a gray car.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through the character’s eyes, the scene is set on an overcast day on a city street lined with large, classical buildings made of light-colored stone. A red, two-door Land Rover with a white roof is parked diagonally in a marked bay on the asphalt. The vehicle is outfitted with a black roof rack carrying a covered load, additional spotlights, and a snorkel. The perspective moves slowly forward, panning along the side of the vehicle. In the further middle ground and background, other cars are parked along the street, and black flags hang from the buildings opposite. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"the STRADMAN\" in red and black.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
