    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a high-angle perspective, looking down through a red metal structure that acts as a foreground frame. Initially, a man is visible in a medium shot, positioned in the center of the frame, clinging to the structure. In the background, far below, a city street is visible in the center, with skyscrapers on either side and a brightly lit building on the right. The man then slips, dropping downwards within the central frame. As he falls, the shot transitions to a full shot, showing his entire body dangling by his arms. He remains in the center of the frame, looking up toward the camera, which is positioned above him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with short, dark hair is seen from a high-angle, downward-looking perspective through a red metal structure. He is wearing a light grey, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. Initially, he is clinging to the structure, with only his torso and one leg visible. He then slips and is left hanging by only his arms, his full body now dangling as he looks up toward the camera with a strained expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point at night, the scene looks straight down through the red, triangular metal beams of a large structure. Far below, a city street is visible, with the red and white lights of traffic flowing between tall skyscrapers. The buildings' windows are illuminated, creating grids of light against the dark architecture. To the right, a modern building with a facade of brightly lit square windows stands next to a dark object hanging from a chain. A person in light-colored clothing is seen climbing within the red metal framework that frames the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a man struggling to hold onto a pole hanging from a skyscraper over a busy street. About half of his body is visible, including one leg and his torso. After he slips, he is left hanging by his arms, and his entire body is visible, except for the portion blocked by another building pole.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
