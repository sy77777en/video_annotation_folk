    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a person on a bicycle is positioned on a wooden platform in the top left of the frame, located in the middle ground. The person launches into the air, moving upwards and towards the center of the frame while remaining in the middle ground. As they perform a backflip, their trajectory arcs from the top left towards the upper center of the frame, set against a background of the sky and distant hills. The main wooden ramp structure occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, below the biker's path. The camera is positioned below the subject, looking up at the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a bright lime-green long-sleeved shirt and a helmet performs a backflip while riding a mountain bike. The rider launches from a tall, rustic wooden platform situated on a rocky hillside. In mid-air, the person and the bicycle are inverted as they complete the rotation against a pale, overcast sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an arid, rocky canyon under a bright, overcast sky, a series of man-made wooden structures are built into a reddish-brown hillside. On the left, a tall wooden platform serves as a starting point, from which a cyclist on a bicycle launches into the air. Below this platform, a large, curved wooden ramp supported by an intricate timber framework spans a gap in the terrain. The landscape is characterized by steep, dirt-covered slopes dotted with sparse green vegetation and layered rock formations in the distance. A white, circular object is affixed to the side of the starting platform's support structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
