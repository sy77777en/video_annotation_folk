    "pre_caption": "This medium shot opens with a line of gymnasts positioned in the left foreground and middle ground, while a single gymnast stands in the right middle ground. The gymnast on the right then runs away from the camera, moving deeper into the background. As she recedes, the composition transitions into a wide shot, encompassing more of the gymnastics facility. The group of gymnasts on the left remains stationary throughout the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied in a messy bun runs away from the camera toward a pile of blue mats in the background. She is wearing a black leotard with a cutout on the back. In the foreground, a line of several other young female gymnasts with diverse skin tones stands watching her. The first girl in the line has a ponytail and long, dark brown hair, wearing a red leotard. Next to her, a girl with light brown hair in a ponytail wears a purple and pink leotard with black lettering along its entire length. The third girl in line has dark brown hair and is dressed in a green leotard with a gold waistband. The other girls in the line are visible behind them, all wearing different colored leotards and standing with their arms by their sides or crossed. Additionally, there is another gymnast, whose hands are barely visible, located on the lower left side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a long gymnastics training facility with two-toned grey walls and a floor that has a greenish hue, covered with both blue and sky blue mats. On the left, a line of young gymnasts in assorted colorful leotards stands still on blue mats. On the right side of the room, a gymnast in a black leotard runs over a row of sky blue mats towards the opposite end, where there is a pile of blue mats and various gymnastics equipment. A metal bar is on the floor near the door on the right, and pipes are attached to the ceiling and the right wall. The room is illuminated by light bars installed on the ceiling, and a blue sign protrudes from the right wall. Additional exercise equipment is located on the left side of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
