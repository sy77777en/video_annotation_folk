    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot, where the Central Intelligence Agency logo is positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, painted on a white brick wall that serves as the background. A dark vertical structure occupies the left foreground. The camera then pans to the right, transitioning into a medium shot. In the final composition, the logo is now on the left side of the frame. A white, stylized statue of a man holding a red telephone receiver is in the right foreground, while a second statue of a woman is visible in the middle ground, positioned between the logo and the male statue. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows the circular logo of the Central Intelligence Agency painted on a white brick wall. The logo has a dark green outer ring with yellow trim, featuring the text \"CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\" in white and \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in red. The center contains a white shield with a red, 16-pointed compass rose, surmounted by a bald eagle. To the right of the logo, two stylized, white statues in suits are seated: one represents a woman, and the other represents a man. The statue in the foreground is in profile, facing right, and holds a red telephone receiver to their ear.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors against a white brick wall under cool, dim lighting. A large, circular seal of the Central Intelligence Agency is prominently displayed on the wall. The seal has a dark green background, a yellow border, and features a white eagle above a shield containing a red compass rose. The text \"CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\" and \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" encircles the emblem. To the right of the seal, a statue-like figure in a dark suit is seated at a desk. In the foreground, an individual in a white shirt is visible holding a red telephone receiver to its ear. A few books are on the desk, and a dark vertical structure partially frames the left side of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
