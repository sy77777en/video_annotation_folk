    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a lush forest landscape, captured from a drone's perspective. The scene is framed to include a dense array of trees and foliage, occupying the majority of the frame. The waterfall is positioned slightly off-center, towards the middle ground, and is partially visible amidst the greenery. The trees are distributed across the frame, with taller ones on the left and right, creating a natural border. The camera maintains a consistent height above the scene, providing an aerial view that emphasizes the scale and depth of the forest. As the video progresses, the camera smoothly transitions, slightly adjusting its angle to reveal more of the waterfall and surrounding vegetation, enhancing the sense of immersion in the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a lush landscape scenery shot, showcasing a vibrant forest filled with a diverse array of trees and foliage. The focus is on the rich environment and the interplay of light filtering through the canopy, creating a serene atmosphere. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the scale and beauty of the natural surroundings, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the tranquility of the scene rather than concentrating on a specific object. The cascading waterfall, partially visible amidst the greenery, adds a dynamic element, enhancing the overall sense of peace and connection to nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a lush, green forest scene from a drone's perspective, showcasing a vibrant ecosystem filled with tall trees and dense foliage. The setting is outdoors, characterized by a steep, wooded landscape with a waterfall cascading down rocky terrain into a small pool below. The time of day appears to be mid-afternoon, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating dappled patterns on the ground. Notable visual elements include the varying shades of green from the leaves, the rough texture of the tree bark, and the smooth, reflective surface of the water. The scene transitions smoothly, revealing the waterfall and surrounding vegetation, emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of the forest environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
