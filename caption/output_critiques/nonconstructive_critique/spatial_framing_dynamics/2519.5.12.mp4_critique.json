    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young boy standing in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the foreground, the out-of-focus silhouette of a person's arm occupies the far left edge of the frame. A desk is visible in the background on the left. The person in the foreground then moves to the right, their dark back progressively crossing the frame and obscuring the boy. By the end of the shot, the foreground person's back and arm dominate the frame, completely blocking the boy from view. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with short, dark hair and flesh-toned skin stands in a room, looking slightly upward. He is wearing a white polo shirt with dark blue horizontal stripes and a dark blue collar, blue jeans, and a brown belt with a silver buckle. His hands are held up in front of his chest as if he is gesturing. The scene is viewed from behind a person in a dark garment, whose arm is initially visible on the left. This person then moves to the right, his dark-clad back gradually obscuring the boy from view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a room with plain, beige-colored walls, illuminated by warm, soft light. In the background, a wooden desk sits in a corner, cluttered with papers, a red item that could be a folder or a book, and a black desk lamp. Several small notes are pinned to the wall above the desk. A young boy in a striped polo shirt and jeans stands in the middle of the room. The view is partially obscured by a dark, out-of-focus silhouette on the left, which moves to block the boy from sight.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from behind and to the right of a person, showing a boy in a striped t-shirt. At the start, it is a medium shot of the boy facing the camera, with a small portion of the person's arm visible on the left side of the frame. As the person moves forward, his body covers the boy, and by the end, only part of the person's arm and back are visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
