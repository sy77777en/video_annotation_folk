    "pre_caption": "A medium shot shows a woman standing in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. She is in profile, facing the right. In the background, vertical panels illuminated in blue are on the far left, while a stack of blue-lit circular objects is on the bottom right. The rest of the background is black. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned woman with shoulder-length brown hair stands on a stage, speaking. She is shown in profile, facing toward the right, with her head turned slightly to address an unseen audience. She wears a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern, a necklace, and a small microphone attached to an earpiece on her right ear. Her arms are bent at the elbows, and her hands are open in a gesturing motion. In her right hand, she holds a small black object, likely a presentation remote.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A woman stands on a stage in front of a dark background. To the left, vertical panels are illuminated with a vibrant blue light. To the right, a stack of large, circular objects is also lit in blue. The woman is wearing a dark, sleeveless dress and has an earpiece with a microphone on her right ear.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
