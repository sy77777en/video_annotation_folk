    "pre_caption": "This video is presented in a split-screen format. The left panel contains a full shot of a woman in a police uniform, positioned in the center-left of her frame. She is seated with her feet propped up on a desk in the foreground, holding a red phone. Her police hat rests on her lap, also in the foreground. In the middle ground to the right, a desk lamp is visible, with a filing cabinet in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's height. The right panel shows a high-angle shot of a bathroom. A man on a blue phone stands in the right foreground. To his left, in the middle ground, three other people are gathered around a pink sink. In the background, a striped shower curtain is initially closed but is then pulled back to reveal another person's head peeking out from the top right of the shower area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is presented in a split-screen format, displaying two distinct scenes simultaneously. On the left, a young woman with fair skin and dark hair with bangs is shown in a dark blue police uniform, complete with an American flag patch on her sleeve. She is sitting back in a chair with her feet propped up on a desk, holding a red rotary telephone to her ear while speaking. Her police hat rests on her lap. On the right, a scene unfolds in a bathroom where a middle-aged man with short brown hair, wearing a yellow argyle sweater over a collared shirt and tie, stands while talking on a light blue telephone with a distressed expression. To the left of the man, there are three people: a woman on the far left wearing a bathrobe with a pink towel wrapped around her head, revealing some dark hair; another woman with blonde hair in a pink checkered dress and slippers, positioned between the first woman and the man; and a child with brown hair and a red hat, whose hands are clasped together on the counter as if in prayer. Both women are moving around anxiously and seem to be supporting the child. In the background, another person with dark hair peeks out from behind a striped shower curtain, wearing a white collared dress shirt and a black tie, looking at the group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is presented in a split-screen format, displaying two distinct indoor locations. The left panel shows a dimly lit office where a person in a police uniform is seated with their feet on a desk, speaking into a red rotary phone. A desk lamp provides focused light on the area, and a filing cabinet is visible in the background. The right panel offers a high-angle view of a vintage-style bathroom with an off-white sink and countertop. A man in a yellow sweater is on a light blue corded phone. The bathroom also contains a striped shower curtain, white blinds, and other individuals gathered near the sink.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video consists of two separate clips, each taking up half of the screen and showing two scenes of people talking on the phone. On the left, the scene features a woman in military uniform, shown in a full shot. She is sitting on a chair with her legs propped up on the table, holding a red, vintage telephone while speaking. On the right, in a bathroom, a man in a yellow sweater is talking on a blue telephone. Three other people are visible on the left, acting anxious. As the shower curtain in the background is pulled back, another person’s head appears from inside the shower room, looking at them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: This video consists of two separate clips, each taking up half of the screen. On the left one, it is At the subject. On the right one, it is above the subject.",
