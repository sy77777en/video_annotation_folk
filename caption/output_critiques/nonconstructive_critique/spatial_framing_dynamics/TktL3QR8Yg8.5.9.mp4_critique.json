    "pre_caption": "This is a static close-up shot. In the foreground, the bell of a gramophone horn occupies the bottom left of the frame. A complex mechanical structure of gears and scrollwork fills the middle ground, extending from the center to the right side. Attached to this structure in the upper center and upper right are several black-and-white photographs. In the background, a string of small, dim lights is visible in the top left corner. The camera is positioned at a slightly low angle, looking up toward the photographs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit space, the scene features several objects. On the left is the large, pale gray, bell-shaped horn of a gramophone, its surface adorned with intricate, dark, swirling patterns. To the right is a complex, dark metal structure composed of interlocking gears, cogs, and ornate, curling metalwork. Attached to this mechanical framework are small, black-and-white photographs. The most prominent photo, which has scalloped edges, shows a man sitting with a small child beside him. Another partially visible photo to the right shows a standing child.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, cluttered setting, the bell of a gray gramophone horn with dark, swirling patterns occupies the left side of the view. The rest of the scene is filled with a complex structure of dark, metallic gears and ornate, vine-like scrollwork. Pinned to this mechanical assembly are three old, black-and-white photographs with scalloped edges. In the dimly lit background, a string of small, teardrop-shaped lights in faint shades of blue, green, and purple are visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows part of a room. In the foreground, on the left, there's a gramophone horn, and on the right, a gear-like structure. In the background, there are three framed two-person photos. The overall lighting in this video is dim.",
