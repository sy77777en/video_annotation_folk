    "pre_caption": "From a camera mounted above the driver of a blue race car, the vehicle and driver occupy the foreground and lower half of the frame. Initially, a green race car is positioned in the middle ground on the right. The asphalt track extends from the foreground into the background, where green, rolling hills are visible across the scene. A small white building is situated in the background on the left, and a single orange cone briefly appears in the foreground on the left. As the blue car moves forward, it overtakes the green car, which shifts from the middle ground right to the background right before exiting the frame. The orange cone also quickly moves past and out of the frame on the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a locked-on perspective from a camera mounted on a bright blue, open-wheel formula-style race car, which occupies the lower portion of the view. The car features a white \"GoPro\" logo on its nose cone. Inside the cockpit, a driver is visible, wearing a white racing suit with red accents, black gloves, and a black helmet, with their hands on the steering wheel. A second race car, a lime green and black sports prototype with a large rear wing and the number \"98\" on its side, is seen on the right. The blue car overtakes the green car on a straight section of the track, and the green car subsequently moves out of view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a blue, open-cockpit race car captures the vehicle speeding straight along an asphalt track. The track winds through a landscape of green, rolling hills under an overcast sky. As the blue car, which features a \"GoPro\" logo on its nose, drives straight, it overtakes a green and black prototype-style race car with a large rear wing. In the background, a small white building stands near the track, and a single orange cone is visible on the side of the road.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video uses a camera mounted on the race car to capture a racing scene. Most of the car and part of the driver’s body are visible in the lower half of the frame. On the right side, two other race cars are initially present but eventually move out of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
