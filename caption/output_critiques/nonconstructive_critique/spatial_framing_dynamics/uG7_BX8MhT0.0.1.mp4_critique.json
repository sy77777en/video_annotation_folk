    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot, filmed from above, initially frames a person's hand in the top right foreground as it begins to zip a large, dark brown leather bag. The bag itself occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the bottom left to the top right in the middle ground. As the hand pulls the zipper from right to left across the top of the bag, the camera pans slightly to the left, following the action. The hand concludes its movement in the top left of the frame, while the bag remains the central element, with its left side becoming more prominent by the end of the shot. The background is softly out of focus throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's hand with a light skin tone is shown zipping a large, dark brown bag. The bag is made of a pebbled leather material and features a prominent, brass-colored metal zipper running along its top opening. The hand grasps the zipper pull and moves it along the track to close the main compartment. A smaller zippered pocket is also visible on the side of the bag.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit indoor setting, a hand is shown zipping a large, dark brown bag. The bag, made of a textured, pebbled leather, rests on a light-colored surface. A prominent brass-colored zipper runs along the top edge, and the hand's fingers are seen guiding the zipper pull smoothly along its track. A smaller zippered pocket is also visible on the side of the bag, while the background remains softly out of focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
