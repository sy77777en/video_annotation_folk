    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a Japanese town street. Initially, a two-story building with a mustard-colored facade occupies the top-left and center-left of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground, with a smaller wooden structure in front of it at the bottom-left. The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing the full length of the street, which extends from the bottom of the frame into the center background. This movement brings more buildings into view on the right side in the middle ground, a white van parked in the center-middle ground, and a tree-covered mountain in the distant background on the right. A few pedestrians are visible walking in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a tranquil streetscape scenery shot of a Japanese town on a clear, sunny day. The scene is characterized by traditional Japanese architecture, including a prominent two-story building with a mustard-yellow facade, a dark tiled roof, and a red awning over its second-floor balcony. The camera pans slowly to the right, revealing a quiet street lined with similar wooden structures. A white van is parked near a stone wall and a small covered structure on the left side of the street, and a few pedestrians are strolling along the sidewalk. In the distance, a lush green mountain rises against a blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is deliberately placed on the environment itself, capturing the peaceful atmosphere and architectural charm of the location rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The slow pan across the setting serves to immerse the viewer in the scale and ambiance of the place.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A slow pan to the right reveals a street in a Japanese town under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. On the left is a two-story building with a mustard-colored upper facade, a red awning, and a traditional tiled roof. In front of it, a smaller, single-story wooden structure with a dark tiled roof sits at the edge of the sidewalk. The paved street is lined with other buildings, and a white van is parked near a stone wall and a small covered structure on the left side of the street. A few pedestrians walk along the sidewalks. In the distance, a tree-covered mountain is visible. The scene is brightly lit by the sun, which casts long shadows across the road.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
