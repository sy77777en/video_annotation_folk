    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of an elderly man, positioned centrally in the foreground. His head and upper shoulders are visible. Behind him, in the background, a plain, light-colored wall is visible, with a faint, out-of-focus rectangular shape also positioned centrally. The man's head moves slightly as he speaks and shakes it, but his overall position within the frame remains constant, and the camera remains static. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An elderly man with gray, slightly wavy hair is shown in a close-up shot, looking straight ahead. He is wearing a dark green, collared, button-up shirt. His skin appears wrinkled, particularly on his forehead and around his eyes. He is speaking with a slight, knowing smile on his face and gently shaking his head to convey his emotions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a room with moderate lighting and a plain, light-colored wall in the background, where a faint, out-of-focus rectangular shape, possibly a picture frame, is visible. The lighting is warm and subdued, casting soft shadows. An older man with gray hair, wearing a dark green, collared shirt, is positioned in the foreground, looking straight ahead and speaking.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
