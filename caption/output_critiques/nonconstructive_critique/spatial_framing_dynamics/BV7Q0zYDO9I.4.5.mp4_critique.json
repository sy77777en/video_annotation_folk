    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot presented as a static, high-angle extreme wide shot. The scene begins with a soft blur and transitions into sharp focus, revealing a large industrial complex. Two long buildings with arched roofs occupy the left and center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A road runs horizontally across the foreground at the bottom of the frame. On the right, several parallel roadways extend from the foreground into the background, running alongside the main buildings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a high-angle, architectural scenery shot of a sprawling, modern industrial or high-security complex, likely a digital rendering. The scene features two massive, parallel buildings with curved, corrugated metal roofs, surrounded by a meticulously planned network of roads and what appear to be multiple security barriers. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to establish the vast scale and sterile, geometric layout of the environment. The focus on the overall design and the monochromatic color palette creates an impersonal and imposing atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A high-angle, rendered view shows a large industrial complex with a muted, monochromatic color scheme. The shot transitions from a soft blur into sharp focus, revealing two long buildings with gray, corrugated, arched roofs. These structures are surrounded by a network of black asphalt roads with white lane markings. To the right of the buildings, several parallel roadways run alongside the complex. The ground is a dark, textured gray.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
