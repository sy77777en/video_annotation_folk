    "pre_caption": "The video displays a medium full shot of a person in a spacesuit, initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, framed by a padded doorway in the foreground. Padded walls are visible to the left and right in the foreground and middle ground, with light panels at the top in the background and a button-covered wall section in the top right background. The person moves forward and slightly to the right, transitioning from the middle ground to the foreground, thus appearing larger in the frame. As they advance, their 2D position shifts from the center towards the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, likely a man based on build, is shown from a low angle, looking up. He is wearing an orange, ribbed spacesuit with green gloves and black straps crisscrossing his chest. A yellow, rectangular chest pack with some visible dials and buttons is attached to the front of the suit. He wears a green helmet with a clear visor, through which his face is partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, within a brightly lit, futuristic corridor or room. The walls are upholstered in white and feature a distinctive padded, chevron-like texture. An open doorway, also lined with the same padded material, is prominent. Above, rectangular, translucent light panels illuminate the space. In the background, sections of a wall appear to be composed of numerous small, navy, blue, and yellow rectangular buttons. An individual in an orange, ribbed spacesuit with a green helmet and a yellow chest-mounted control box is moving through the doorway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
