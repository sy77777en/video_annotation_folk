    "pre_caption": "This wide shot presents a scene with distinct depth. The bottom of the frame is a solid black silhouette of the foreground and middle ground. In the middle ground, a small, silhouetted figure with glowing eyes is positioned slightly to the right of center, pushing a rectangular box from left to right. To the far left, another box-like object rests in the middle ground. A large, indistinct, spiky structure occupies the center background, shrouded in fog, with thin shapes hanging from the top of the frame. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level, capturing the side-scrolling movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, silhouetted figure, appearing as a completely black shape with a round head and a small body, is positioned in the scene. The only visible features on this character are two large, bright, white, glowing circles for eyes. The figure is crouched behind a black, rectangular box. To the left of this figure is another, similar black box, distinguished by two white arrows pointing upwards on its side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, a silhouetted landscape is presented in a monochromatic black-and-white style with a heavy vignette effect. The outdoor setting features a dark, grassy hill under a foggy, hazy sky, with beams of light cutting through the gloom. In the blurry background, a large, indistinct, and spiky structure looms, while thin, vine-like shapes hang from above. The foreground is a solid black silhouette, where a small character with glowing white eyes pushes a dark, rectangular box. To the left, another box-like object stands, marked with two white, upward-pointing arrows.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
