    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot, filmed from directly above, features a gold-colored smartphone positioned horizontally in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A light-skinned left hand is visible on the left side of the frame in the foreground, partially obscuring the left edge of the phone. A white paper strip with handwritten numbers is taped across the top portion of the phone's screen. A light-skinned right hand, also in the foreground, enters from the right and holds a silver, pen-like tool. This tool moves horizontally across the phone's screen in the center of the frame, initially from left to right over the paper strip, then moving downwards to tap or scratch the app icons below, before moving back towards the center. In the background, a silver, flat, blade-like tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it is positioned at the top of the frame, slightly left of center. To the right of the phone, in the middle ground to background, another silver, pointed tool is visible, with a third similar tool partially visible further to the far right. The entire scene is set against a plain white surface that fills the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned left hand is positioned at the left side of a smartphone, which is displaying a home screen with various app icons. A white paper strip with handwritten numbers is taped horizontally across the top portion of the phone's screen. A light-skinned right hand holds a silver, pen-like tool with a pointed metal tip and a knurled grip, using it to scratch or tap the surface of the phone screen, moving across the app icons. In the background, a silver, flat, blade-like tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it in black is visible at the top, and another silver, pointed tool with a knurled grip lies to the right of the phone.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot, where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, shows a smartphone lying on a plain white surface. The phone's screen is illuminated, displaying a grid of colorful app icons. A narrow white strip of paper or tape is adhered horizontally across the top portion of the screen, bearing handwritten black numbers and symbols: \"2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\". Two hands are visible; the left hand is in the frame but not steadying the phone, while the right hand holds a silver, metallic, pen-like tool with a pointed tip, which is being moved across the phone's screen. In the background, above the phone, a silver, flat, rectangular tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed in black on a white label is partially visible. To the right of the phone, two other silver, metallic, pointed tools are present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The shot size description is inaccurate because it fails to differentiate between the framing of the smartphone and the hands. The description of the hands' positions is unclear. The depth of the metal tools is incorrectly described; the 'JerryRigEverything' tool is misidentified as being in the middle ground, and the depth of the other tools is also misstated. The caption fails to identify the white background surface. Additionally, the caption incorrectly describes the smartphone as 'gold-colored'.",
