    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot focusing on a long, flooded corridor. The scene begins with a wide shot of the tiled hallway, which recedes from the foreground to the background. Water fills the bottom half of the frame, while a metal handrail runs along a low wall on the right. In the background, a large rubber duck is positioned in the center of the frame at the far end of the corridor. The camera, positioned at eye level, moves forward through the space before the shot cuts to a close-up of the rubber duck. In this final shot, the duck is centered in the frame, with the camera at its eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a surreal interior scenery shot of a liminal space, characterized by a long, narrow hallway flooded with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in glossy white tiles, illuminated by a series of stark, square light fixtures that cast a sterile, clinical glow. A simple metal handrail lines a narrow walkway on the right side of the flooded passage, which recedes into the distance where a large, yellow rubber duck with wide eyes floats in an alcove. There is no main subject because the focus is on the disquieting atmosphere and the unsettling scale of the environment itself. The combination of familiar architectural elements with the bizarre flooding and the out-of-place object creates a dreamlike and unnerving mood, making the space, rather than any single element within it, the central point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera zooms in with a slight shaking motion through a long, narrow, flooded indoor corridor. The walls, ceiling, and partitions are all covered in small, white tiles. Square light fixtures are set into the ceiling, illuminating the space. Dark, rippling water fills the lower center half of the frame, and a metal handrail runs along a low wall on the right side of the water. At the far end of the corridor, a large, yellow rubber duck with wide, round eyes and a red-orange beak floats in a lit alcove. The scene has a slight lens distortion effect.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a close-up shot.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dramatic scene of a long, flooded corridor. It opens with a wide shot of the tiled hallway, stretching from the foreground into the distance. Water covers the floor, creating a reflective surface, while a metal handrail is visible along the right side of the corridor. In the background, a large rubber duck is prominently placed at the far end of the hallway. The camera, positioned at eye level, glides smoothly through the space, eventually focusing on the rubber duck. In the final shot, the duck is prominently featured, with the camera maintaining eye-level alignment.",
