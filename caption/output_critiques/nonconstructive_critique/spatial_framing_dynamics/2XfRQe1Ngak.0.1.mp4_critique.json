    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a kayaker, who is consistently positioned in the center foreground. Initially, the camera is above the subject, capturing them moving forward through turbulent whitewater that fills the foreground and middle ground, with dark rock walls on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera perspective then shifts to the kayaker's eye level. From this viewpoint, the kayaker remains in the center foreground, actively paddling, as the flanking rock walls appear to move from the background towards the foreground on either side. Briefly, a second kayaker is visible in the top center to top right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground to background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person kayaking through turbulent waters. The individual is wearing a red and black wetsuit and a helmet with visible logos. They are gripping a paddle, maneuvering through the white water, which splashes around them. The person is oriented forward, focused on navigating the challenging conditions. The helmet and wetsuit provide protection, indicating the intensity of the activity. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the kayaker and the rushing water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a kayaker navigating through a narrow, dark rock canyon filled with turbulent whitewater. The kayaker, wearing a red jacket, a grey helmet with orange markings, and a life vest, paddles vigorously. The dark, textured rock walls of the canyon rise steeply on either side of the rushing water. Another kayaker in a red kayak is briefly visible further down the waterway. The scene is dynamic, with water splashing and the kayaker actively maneuvering through the rapids.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
