    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a vertical trail of gold foil, banknotes, and coins arranged from the top left to the center of the frame against a black background, with an additional pile visible in the bottom right foreground. The camera moves upward, following the trail as it transforms into a single, grey, rock-like sculpture that remains centered. As the camera continues its upward movement, the sculpture is revealed to be a floating, stone-like object. This first object drifts toward the top left of the frame as a second, larger stone appears in the center-right. The final shot is a full view of these two stones floating independently, one positioned in the top left and the other in the center-right of the black void.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a collection of items representing wealth, including crumpled gold foil, stacks of paper banknotes, and round, gold-colored coins, arranged in a vertical trail against a black background. This trail of money and gold transitions into a single, complex sculpture where the gold foil appears to be consumed by a grey, rock-like material. The transformation completes, revealing a solid, light-grey object with a faceted, textured surface, resembling a crumpled piece of paper or a small asteroid. This object is then joined by other similar grey, rock-like forms, all floating independently.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a scattered collection of gold-colored foil, coins, and paper stacks begins to transform. The golden materials morph and coalesce, rising and changing into a single, grey, craggy, rock-like object. This object, resembling an asteroid, floats in the black void, soon joined by a second, similar floating rock.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins by showcasing a collection of banknotes and coins. The camera moves along the direction of the money and coins, gradually transitioning to a sculpture-like object. It continues to move, sequentially revealing three stone-like objects, ultimately coming to a stop on a full shot of one of the stones.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Lacking background information makes it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
