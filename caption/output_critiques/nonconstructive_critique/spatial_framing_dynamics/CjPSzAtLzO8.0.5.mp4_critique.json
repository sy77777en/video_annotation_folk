    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level and tilted, creating a Dutch angle. Initially, the primary motorcyclist is in the center-left of the frame and in the middle ground, leaning sharply into a turn on a paved surface that occupies the bottom half and extends towards the top right, spanning the foreground to middle ground. A concrete edge runs along the bottom left, also in the foreground and middle ground. In the background, distant mountains are visible in the top right under a clear sky at the top of the frame. As the camera tracks the main rider, they move across the frame from center-left towards the center and then slightly to the right of center, remaining in the middle ground. Towards the end of the shot, a second motorcyclist enters the frame in the top right, positioned in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, wearing a full-face helmet that is predominantly red and white with black and blue accents and a white number \"6\" on the top, is riding a motorcycle. The rider is clad in a racing suit that is primarily red, white, and blue, adorned with various logos and text. The motorcycle is a sportbike, colored red, white, and blue, with a prominent white number \"6\" on its front fairing and the word \"TechSpec\" visible on its side. The rider's body is curled tightly against the motorcycle as they lean sharply into a turn. As the camera moves, another motorcyclist can be seen to the right front of the rider, suggesting they might be in a race.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a motorcycle with a rider in red, white, and blue racing gear, marked with the number \"6\" and \"TechSpec,\" leaning sharply into a turn on a wide, sloped, paved surface. The setting is outdoors, in a desert-like environment with distant, hazy mountains visible under a clear, bright blue sky, suggesting a sunny day. The distant sides of the road reveal a desert landscape with sparse tufts of grass. The paved surface has a dark grey, smooth texture, with a lighter grey, slightly raised concrete edge on one side. The motorcycle casts a distinct shadow on the pavement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
