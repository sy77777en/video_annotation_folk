    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high angle, looking down at two glowing figures standing in the bottom center of the frame. The figures are situated in the middle ground of a dark, open courtyard. In the background, the dark facades of multi-story buildings enclose the scene, occupying the upper and side portions of the frame. The entire composition is static, with no movement from the subjects or the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two stylized, glowing white human figures stand side by side. They are depicted as featureless silhouettes, lacking any discernible clothing, hair, or facial details, but possessing a clear humanoid form with a head, torso, and limbs. Both are in a static standing pose.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark, black-and-white scene, a high-angle view looks down into a dark urban courtyard. The courtyard is enclosed by the dark facades of multi-story buildings, some of whose windows are brightly lit from within. In the center of the open, dark ground, two featureless, humanoid figures stand side-by-side, glowing with a soft white light that illuminates the area immediately around them. The animated digital video suggests a nighttime setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
