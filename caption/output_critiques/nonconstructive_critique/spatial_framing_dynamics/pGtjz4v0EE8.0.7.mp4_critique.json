    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a high angle, presents a cityscape scenery of a Venetian canal with no single main subject. A tilt-shift effect blurs the top and bottom of the frame. In the background, the canal narrows as it stretches into the distance between rows of buildings. The middle ground is dominated by the wide canal in the center, which is flanked by multi-story buildings on the left and right sides of the frame. On the right, numerous boats are docked along the canal bank. The time-lapse shows dynamic movement as various watercraft, including a large white water bus on the left and several gondolas in the center, navigate the middle ground. A white boat also briefly enters the bottom left foreground and moves toward the center before the clip ends.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling canal in Venice, Italy. There is no single main subject, as the high-angle perspective and prominent tilt-shift effect create a miniature-like diorama, emphasizing the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment rather than a specific element. The murky green water of the wide canal is filled with various watercraft, including long, black gondolas navigated by gondoliers, larger white water buses, and smaller motorboats. Lining both sides of the waterway are historic, multi-story buildings in warm, earthy tones. On the right bank, numerous red awnings shade what appear to be waterfront cafes or restaurants, where people are gathered, adding to the lively scene under a bright, overexposed sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures the bustling activity along the Grand Canal in Venice during a bright day. The wide, greenish waterway is flanked on both sides by rows of historic, multi-story buildings in shades of yellow and tan. On the right bank, several establishments feature red awnings over waterfront areas where people are gathered. The canal is busy with various watercraft, including long, black gondolas being rowed, larger white water buses, and smaller motorboats, all moving swiftly and creating wakes on the water's surface. The scene is presented with a tilt-shift effect, which blurs the top and bottom of the view, giving the city a miniature-like appearance under a bright, washed-out sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
