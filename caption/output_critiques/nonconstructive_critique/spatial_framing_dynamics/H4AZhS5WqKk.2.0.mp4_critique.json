    "pre_caption": "The video uses a medium shot, showing Tom the Cat from the waist up, centered in the frame and occupying the middle ground directly behind a window. The window frame and glass are in the foreground, spanning the bottom and sides of the frame, with Tom’s right hand and finger raised and extended toward the glass at the center. Tom’s face and upper body are positioned centrally, with his head and ears near the top center and his torso extending downward. The cityscape, including tall buildings with illuminated windows and a cylindrical water tower, fills the background, with the water tower slightly right of center. Rain is visible throughout the scene, with droplets and streaks on the glass in the foreground. The camera remains at Tom’s eye level, facing him directly. As the video progresses, Tom’s finger moves in a circular motion on the glass, cutting a circle; his hand and finger remain in the center foreground, while his body stays mostly stationary, maintaining the same spatial relationship to the camera and window. The framing and depth remain consistent, with Tom as the central subject, the window in the foreground, and the cityscape in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated anthropomorphic cat with dark gray fur, a lighter gray face and chest, and large, pointed ears with pink interiors. The cat has prominent yellow eyes, a small black nose, and a white mouth and hands. Its expression is serious, with a slightly furrowed brow. This is the classic image of Tom the Cat from the animated series Tom and Jerry. Tom is depicted extending a finger of his right hand, using his sharp black nail to cut a circle on the glass in front of him. The setting suggests a cityscape, but the focus remains on Tom's distinctive appearance and gesture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors at night in a city environment, with rain falling steadily and droplets visible in the air. Tall buildings with illuminated windows and glowing signage form the urban skyline in the background, while a cylindrical water tower with a weathered, brown surface stands prominently among the structures. The sky is dark, and the wet surfaces reflect the city lights, adding a glossy sheen to the scene. In the foreground, a brown window frame with a central glass pane features prominently. Behind the glass, Tom, a large animated gray and white cat with pink inner ears and yellow eyes, stands facing the viewer. His fur appears dampened by the rain, giving it a textured appearance, and his expression is stern. Water droplets and streaks are visible on the glass, enhancing the rainy atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
