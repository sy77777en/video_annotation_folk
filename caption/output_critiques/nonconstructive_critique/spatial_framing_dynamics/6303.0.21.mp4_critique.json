    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from a first-person perspective, with a medium shot size focusing on a man in an orange outfit. He is centrally positioned, facing the camera, and performing a rap while moving backward. The camera advances toward him, maintaining a consistent height at the subject's level. In the foreground, a pair of hands is visible; the left hand, positioned on the left side of the frame, holds a white comb, while the right hand, on the right side, holds pink-handled scissors. The setting is a vibrant barbershop with a black-and-white checkered pattern on the walls and floor, creating a bold visual contrast. The man remains in the middle ground, while the hands are in the foreground, emphasizing the haircut in progress. The background features mirrors and neon lights, adding depth and a lively ambiance to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with medium brown skin tone and curly black hair, wearing an orange textured outfit. He faces the camera, performing a rap while moving backward as the camera advances. In the foreground, a pair of hands is visible; the left hand holds a white comb, and the right hand holds pink-handled scissors. The man appears animated and expressive, engaging directly with the viewer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set in a vibrant barbershop. The environment is indoors, featuring a distinctive black-and-white checkered pattern on the walls and floor, creating a bold visual contrast. The time of day is not explicitly indicated, but the interior is well-lit, suggesting artificial lighting. Notable visual elements include a person in a bright orange textured sweater, positioned centrally, with hands holding a comb and a razor in the foreground, indicating a haircut in progress. The barbershop is lively, with mirrors reflecting the scene and neon lights adding a colorful ambiance. The setting is dynamic, capturing the essence of a bustling, stylish grooming space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from a first-person, high-angle view, showing a pair of hands and a man. The left hand holds a comb, and the right hand holds scissors. The man, dressed in an orange outfit, faces the camera and performs a rap, backing away as the camera moves forward.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
