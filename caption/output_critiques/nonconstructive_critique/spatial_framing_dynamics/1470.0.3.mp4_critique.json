    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a person standing in front of a yellow house, capturing the subject from head to toe. The person is positioned in the foreground, centered slightly to the left of the frame, with their back to the camera. The house occupies the middle ground and stretches across the center-right portion of the frame. The house's white door, marked with the number \"6701,\" is slightly ajar and located centrally in the middle ground. The brick chimney is situated towards the top left of the house in the background. The small garden with red flowers and green shrubs lies in the foreground, extending from the bottom left to the bottom right. A small figurine is placed near the bottom left corner of the frame, close to the garden. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of the subjects and elements within the frame. The overall composition remains static, focusing on the person and the house.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person standing in front of a yellow house with a white door. They have short, straight reddish-brown hair and are wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark high-waisted pants. Their back is to the camera, and they are facing the house, which has a brick chimney and a small garden with red flowers. The house number \"6701\" is visible next to the door. The person appears to be observing the house, and the door is slightly ajar, suggesting they may be about to enter or have just arrived.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor scene in front of a small, single-story house with a yellow exterior and a gray shingled roof. The house features two doors: an outer door that is open and an inner door that is closed. The number \"6701\" is displayed near the door. Brick steps lead up to the entrance. There is also a small figurine of a character with a red hat and white beard. The windows have decorative crossbars, and a brick chimney is visible on the roof. The setting is a sunny day, with a clear blue sky and well-maintained green grass in the front yard. Red flowers and green shrubs line the pathway leading to the entrance. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a clear perspective of the house and its surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
