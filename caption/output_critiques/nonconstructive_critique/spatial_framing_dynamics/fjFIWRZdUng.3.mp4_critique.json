    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a naval battle scene. A destroyer is positioned in the right foreground, angled steeply with its bow lifted out of the water and pointing towards the upper center of the frame. In the middle ground, an aircraft carrier is visible in the center-right, and a smoking landmass occupies the left side of the frame. The scene is framed with a dark, overcast sky in the top half and the sea in the bottom half. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the overall scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a naval battle scenery shot depicting a chaotic engagement at sea under a dark, overcast sky. In the middle ground, a modern gray destroyer is seen at a dramatic angle, with flames and thick black smoke billowing from its superstructure. Further in the distance, the large silhouette of an aircraft carrier is visible through the haze, while on the left, a landmass with palm trees is also engulfed in smoke from fires. The video lacks a single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vast, destructive scale and tense atmosphere of the entire battle scene rather than focusing on any individual vessel. The focus is on conveying the environmental chaos of the conflict.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds across a large body of water under a dark, overcast sky thick with smoke. In the distance, a coastline with palm trees and structures shows signs of smoke, while a gray aircraft carrier sits further out on the murky, greenish-blue water. A gray naval destroyer prominently occupies the right side of the middle ground, angled steeply with its bow lifted out of the water. Fires are visible on its superstructure, releasing plumes of black smoke, and its exposed hull reveals propellers and a forward gun turret.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
