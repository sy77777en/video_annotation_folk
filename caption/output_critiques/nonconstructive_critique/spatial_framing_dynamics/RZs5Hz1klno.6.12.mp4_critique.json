    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a group of soldiers is framed from the chest up, positioned on an armored vehicle. A central soldier in a dark green helmet occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. To his left, another soldier is partially visible in the left-middle ground. In the background, a soldier is seen smoking in the top-left. To the right of the central soldier, other soldiers are positioned in the right-middle ground. A large, open circular hatch is located in the center-right middle ground, behind the central soldier. The tan vehicle itself fills the bottom of the frame, extending into the middle ground. In the background, a slatted structure and foliage are visible. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of male soldiers in desert camouflage uniforms are seated inside a military vehicle. All soldiers are wearing camouflage uniforms, tactical vests, and green camouflage helmets. The central soldier, a man with a darker complexion, wears a dark green helmet with large headphones and holds a rifle. Behind him, a large, circular, tan-colored hatch is open. To the right of the frame, a soldier speaks into a radio handset. Another soldier is wearing sunglasses, and one soldier, facing away from the camera, has a cigarette in his mouth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor daytime setting, a group of soldiers in desert camouflage uniforms and helmets are positioned on a tan-colored armored vehicle. The soldiers are equipped with tactical vests and rifles. A large, circular hatch on the vehicle is open. In the background, a slatted structure and some green foliage are visible. The entire scene is overlaid with a horizontal scanline effect, and text in the bottom-left corner reads, \"[15, 22]; PBS Frontline - Once Upon a Time in Iraq (2020)\" in white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
