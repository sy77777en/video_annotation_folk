    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a low-angle medium shot of a person's lower body in a crouch, positioned in the center of the frame on a green field in the foreground. The shot then cuts to an eye-level medium shot of the person's upper body, now positioned in the center-right against a solid white background. Their long hair flows dynamically, occupying the top and left portions of the frame, while their left arm is raised in the foreground on the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An anime character, a young man with very long, flowing black hair and light-colored eyes, is depicted on a green field. He wears a red sleeveless athletic jersey with black stripes over a black long-sleeved undershirt that has purple stripes on the arms. His attire is completed with matching red shorts over black leggings, and black and white cleats. The character, who has black nail polish on his fingernails, is initially seen in a low crouch before transitioning to a more upright, dynamic pose where his hair whips around his face as he looks forward with a focused expression. A patch is visible on his left sleeve.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a soccer field with vibrant, bright green turf marked by a white line. The setting is brightly lit. The perspective shifts to a medium shot to show an anime character's upper body against a stark, overexposed white background, where a person's long black hair flows dynamically. The individual is wearing a red jersey with black stripes over a black long-sleeved undershirt, along with black and white cleats.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",
