    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a dark gray airplane, labeled \"UAL 1,\" positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Glowing green taxiway lines curve from the foreground toward the airplane. The camera then shifts to the right, moving the first airplane to the right background and bringing a second airplane, labeled \"PAL 115,\" into a full shot in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark gray, two-engine commercial airplane, identified by the white text \"UAL 1\" floating above it, is shown on a taxiway at night. The taxiway is marked with glowing green lines. The view then shifts to the left to show a second, similar-looking dark gray, two-engine commercial airplane on the same taxiway, identified by the white text \"PAL 115\" above it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a dark airport taxiway at night, two passenger airplanes are positioned on a curved path marked by glowing green lines. The first airplane is stationary, while the second airplane, identified as \"PAL 115,\" is positioned behind it, appearing to be parked. White text overlays with a slight glow are positioned above each aircraft, identifying them as \"UAL 1\" and \"PAL 115.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
