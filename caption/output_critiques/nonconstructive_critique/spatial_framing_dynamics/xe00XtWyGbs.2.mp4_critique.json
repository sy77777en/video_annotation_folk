    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, captures a bedroom where a woman is initially positioned in the background, slightly right of center, placing clothes inside an open closet. A large pile of clothes dominates the middle ground, centered on a bed that extends across the frame. To the far left, a nightstand is in the middle ground with a mirror on the wall behind it, while a dresser occupies the middle ground on the far right. The woman then turns and walks forward out of the closet, moving into the middle ground on the right side of the frame, where she stops beside the bed and leans over the pile of clothes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair is shown in a bedroom organizing clothes. She wears a mustard-yellow and white striped, long-sleeved top with a peplum waist, paired with blue jeans. Throughout the video, she is seen retrieving clothes from a large pile on the bed, which consists of numerous items, many still on white hangers. She then hangs the clothes in the closet before returning to the bed to continue organizing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a bedroom during the daytime, where a large bed with a grey upholstered headboard is covered with multiple piles of clothing, much of it on white plastic hangers. To the right of the bed, a wooden dresser holds a lamp with a yellow shade, a phone, and a tissue box, with several picture frames hanging on the white wall above. To the left, a round, black-framed mirror is mounted on the wall above a nightstand featuring a lit lamp with a white cylindrical shade. In the background, an open sliding closet is initially empty until a woman with long dark hair, wearing a yellow and white striped top and jeans, places a pile of clothes inside.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
