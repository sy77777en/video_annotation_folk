    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a skyscape, where a massive cumulonimbus cloud is the primary element. The cloud's bright, anvil-shaped top occupies the upper-center and upper-left of the frame, while its darker, shadowed base extends down towards the bottom-left, positioning the entire formation in the middle ground. The deep blue sky serves as the background, visible in the top-right and right portions of the frame. A thin, dark silhouette of the horizon is positioned in the foreground along the very bottom edge of the shot. In this time-lapse sequence, the cloud formation slowly expands, with its anvil top spreading horizontally across the upper frame. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up from the ground level towards the towering cloud high in the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot dominated by a colossal cumulonimbus cloud. The composition focuses on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system, making the environment itself the primary point of interest rather than a distinct subject. This massive cloud formation, characteristic of a thunderhead, features a flattened, anvil-shaped top that is brilliantly white where it catches the sunlight, contrasting sharply with its dark, shadowed base and the deep blue of the surrounding sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a massive, anvil-shaped cumulonimbus cloud against a deep blue sky. The upper, flattened portion of the cloud is a brilliant white, illuminated by sunlight, while the base is a dark, shadowy gray. Throughout the sequence, the cloud slowly evolves and expands, its top spreading wider.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
