    "pre_caption": "A wide shot captures two riders on futuristic motorcycles positioned side-by-side in the middle ground, with the camera at their level. The rider with orange accents is on the left, and the rider with green accents is on the right, set against a dark background with out-of-focus stadium lights. As both riders move forward, the camera tracks alongside them. The rider on the right gradually pulls ahead, moving slightly toward the foreground and the center of the frame, while the rider on the left shifts further left. By the end of the clip, the green-accented motorcycle on the right partially obscures the view of the orange-accented motorcycle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two riders on futuristic motorcycles are positioned side-by-side, facing forward. The rider on the left wears a form-fitting black suit and a matching helmet, both accented with glowing orange lines that trace the contours of their body and head. They are leaning forward over their motorcycle, which is also black with glowing orange highlights on its large, hubless wheels and body, and features two bright white headlights. To the right, a second rider is in a similar racing posture on another motorcycle. This rider's black suit and helmet are detailed with glowing light green lines. Their motorcycle mirrors the design of the first but is accented with the same light green color and also has bright white headlights.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a dark, futuristic arena at night, featuring a sleek, reflective ground plane. In the background, faint, out-of-focus lights hint at stadium architecture. Two figures ride side-by-side on futuristic motorcycles, leaving glowing tracks beneath their wheels that add a dynamic and visually striking element to the scene. The motorcycle on the left is black with bright orange neon accents, while the one on the right is black with greenish-cyan neon highlights. Both vehicles boast large, glowing, hubless wheels and bright white headlights, illuminating the path ahead as they move forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
