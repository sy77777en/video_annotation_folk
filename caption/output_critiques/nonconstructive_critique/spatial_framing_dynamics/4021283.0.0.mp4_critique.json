    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture the landscape, showing the rice paddies and surrounding scenery in their entirety. The rectangular and irregular rice fields fill most of the frame, stretching from the bottom foreground to the distant background, with water-filled and green sections creating a patchwork pattern. Small huts are scattered throughout, appearing in the middle ground and background, often positioned toward the left, right, or center of the frame depending on the shot. Clusters of banana plants and dense trees line the edges, mainly along the left, right, and top edges of the frame, with a forested area visible in the background near the top. The camera is positioned above the scene, looking down from a high angle, which emphasizes the geometric layout and spatial relationships between the fields, water channels, and vegetation. There are no major changes in shot size or subject position, and the camera maintains a consistent aerial perspective throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a breathtaking landscape of expansive, rectangular rice paddies, emphasizing the serene environment and atmosphere. The vibrant green and brown fields form a patchwork, interspersed with water-filled sections that reflect the sky. Occasional huts are visible, adding a touch of rural life, but the primary focus remains on the scale and layout of the paddies, with lines and patterns created by the fields and irrigation channels. Lush greenery and distant trees frame the scene, enhancing the sense of vastness and tranquility, allowing viewers to fully appreciate the beauty and harmony of the rural landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape of terraced rice fields stretching across a rural area, with rectangular and irregular plots separated by narrow earthen ridges and filled with water or vibrant green crops. The fields are bordered by clusters of tall, leafy banana plants and patches of dense trees, with a forested area visible in the distance under a hazy sky. Small wooden huts with sloped roofs are scattered among the fields, and the ground appears wet, reflecting the overcast daylight. The overall scene is marked by the geometric arrangement of the fields, the lush greenery, and the presence of water channels running between the plots.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
