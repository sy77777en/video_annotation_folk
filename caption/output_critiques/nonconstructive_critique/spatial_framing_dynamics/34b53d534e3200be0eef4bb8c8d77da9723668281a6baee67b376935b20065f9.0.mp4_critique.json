    "pre_caption": "The video starts as a close-up of the ground covered with yellow leaves, transitioning into a wide shot as the camera pans right and slightly upward. Initially, the focus is on the lower left corner, showing the leaves and part of a hedge with small yellow flowers in the foreground. As the camera moves, the hedge extends horizontally across the frame from left to right, occupying the middle ground. A woman appears in the middle-left portion of the frame, sitting on the ground and leaning against the hedge. She is in the foreground, positioned slightly to the left of the center. Two men are introduced on the right side of the frame, also in the foreground, facing the woman. One man kneels closer to the center-right, while the other stands further back, near the right edge. The background includes a fence running parallel to the path and several parked cars, indicating a suburban setting. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. The transition from the initial close-up to the wide shot smoothly reveals the full scene, capturing all elements in their respective positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a scene along a path covered with yellow leaves. Initially, the focus is on the leaves and a hedge covered with yellow leaves that have fallen onto it. As the scene unfolds, a woman is shown sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Nearby, two men are facing her. One man is wearing a white shirt and navy jeans, and the other is wearing a yellow shirt. Both men have a fair skin tone. The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence, with multiple cars visible in the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins by capturing an outdoor setting along a narrow pathway bordered by dense hedges adorned with yellow leaves. The ground is covered with a thick layer of fallen yellow leaves, creating a vibrant contrast against the gray pavement. Initially, the video focuses on the withered yellow leaves on the ground and the nearby hedge. As the camera pans right and tilts up, it transitions to a scene set during the day, with natural light illuminating the area. In the background, a fence runs parallel to the path, and a few trees are visible, adding to the natural ambiance. Several parked cars, including white, red, and black ones, suggest a suburban or park-like environment. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the notable visual elements being the bright yellow leaves and the lush greenery of the hedges.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
