    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a serene seascape, capturing a pebble-strewn beach in the foreground, stretching across the bottom of the frame. The ocean occupies the middle ground, extending to the horizon in the background, which is positioned near the top of the frame under a clear sky. As the video progresses, three boats appear in succession, moving from left to right across the middle ground, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The camera remains at a consistent height, parallel to the beach, maintaining a stable view of the tranquil setting. The focus is on the natural environment, with the rhythmic motion of the waves and the expansive sea dominating the composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a serene seascape scenery shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a pebble-strewn beach meeting the gentle waves of a vast, blue ocean. The horizon stretches endlessly under a clear sky, creating a sense of openness and calm. As the video progresses, three boats appear in succession, gracefully moving across the scene, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil setting. The focus remains on the natural environment, emphasizing the rhythmic motion of the waves and the expansive scale of the sea, while the boats enhance the atmosphere of peacefulness and continuity, highlighting the beauty of the natural world.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a tranquil beach setting during the daytime, with clear blue skies and calm ocean waves gently lapping against a pebbled shoreline. The pebbles are varied in color, ranging from earthy browns to muted reds, and have a smooth, rounded texture. The ocean extends to the horizon, its surface a deep blue with subtle ripples. In the distance, three boats can be seen moving in succession, adding a sense of scale to the expansive seascape. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the natural elements of the sea and sky dominating the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
