    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing a group of people distributed across the frame in an outdoor park or zoo setting. Most subjects are positioned in the middle ground, with a metal fence running horizontally and separating them from the background, which consists of trees, rocks, and low beige buildings. In the first image, a woman in a white shirt and pants stands near the center, next to a stroller and a child in a red shirt, both located slightly right of center and in the middle ground. To their left, a man in light clothing leans on the fence, while a woman in a dark jacket and skirt stands nearby, both in the middle ground and left of center. Additional people are spaced along the fence, including a man in a white top and green pants with an orange mask (far left, middle ground) and a woman in a yellow top and blue jeans (left, middle ground). In the second image, the camera angle shifts slightly right, showing the woman with long dark hair and the man in light clothing now closer to the center, both still at the fence in the middle ground, while a child in a red shirt appears at the far right, middle ground. The camera remains at approximately eye level with the standing adults, maintaining a consistent height throughout the shots. There is no significant movement among the subjects, and the spatial arrangement emphasizes the group’s distribution along the fence, with the background scenery providing depth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows several people of varying ages and appearances gathered near a metal fence. Among them is a woman in a white shirt, white pants, and a dark cap, standing next to a stroller and a young child in a red shirt and blue pants. Another man, dressed in light-colored clothing, is seen leaning on the fence, while a woman with long dark hair, wearing a dark jacket and skirt, stands nearby. Additional people include a man wearing a white top, green pants, and an orange mask, as well as a woman in a yellow top beneath a dark jacket, blue jeans, and a light-colored mask. The group appears to be casually observing something beyond the fence, and their clothing and postures suggest a relaxed, everyday outing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor setting in a park or zoo during daytime, with bright natural light and lush green trees providing a leafy canopy overhead. The ground is paved and bordered by metal railings, which separate the walkway from an enclosed area featuring large rocks and a few low, beige buildings in the background. Several people are present, some standing near the railings and others walking or pushing strollers, all dressed in casual, light clothing suitable for warm weather. The environment is open and spacious, with the vibrant green foliage dominating the scene and no visible overlays or digital elements present.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
