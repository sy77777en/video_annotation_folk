    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot from a top-down perspective, with the camera positioned directly above the scene. Initially, a single open suitcase is placed near the top-center of the frame in the middle ground, with the pale wooden floor filling the rest of the image. As the video progresses, various personal items and clothing are added and arranged in a grid pattern around the suitcase, occupying the left, right, and bottom areas of the frame, all in the middle ground. The suitcase remains at the top-center, while shirts, pants, shoes, and accessories are distributed symmetrically to the left, right, and bottom-center, with smaller items like socks, underwear, and toiletries filling gaps between larger items. No elements are present in the foreground or background, as all items are laid flat on the floor. The camera maintains a consistent height above the subjects throughout, capturing the entire arrangement in a single, evenly lit overhead view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an open, empty suitcase with a hard shell and light-colored interior, positioned laid flat and fully unzipped. Later, the suitcase is surrounded by a variety of neatly arranged personal items and clothing, including several shirts in different colors and patterns, a pair of blue jeans, brown pants, a striped t-shirt, a green sweater, socks, underwear, a belt, a necktie, a pair of brown shoes, a wristwatch, a smartphone, a laptop, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a razor, deodorant, and bottles of toiletries. Each item is laid out flat and organized in a grid-like pattern, with the suitcase remaining at the top-center, emphasizing the assortment of travel essentials.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors against a pale, whitewashed wooden floor with horizontal planks, creating a textured and slightly rustic backdrop. At first, a single open suitcase with a light gray fabric interior is positioned near the upper center of the floor. A neatly organized arrangement of various travel essentials and clothing items gradually appears, laid out in a grid pattern on both sides and below the open suitcase. These items include shirts in blue, red, green, yellow, and white, pants in brown and blue denim, shoes, socks, belts, a tie, undergarments, a watch, a smartphone, a laptop, toiletries, and grooming products. Each item is carefully placed, with clear separation and alignment, and the materials range from cotton and denim to leather and plastic. The overall color palette is muted, with soft pastels and earth tones dominating the scene. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present, and the lighting is even, with no strong shadows, suggesting a well-lit environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
