    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a man initially positioned in the center-right foreground, bent over his skateboard, which is also in the foreground. To his left, in the middle ground, a black sedan is parked, with a light pole slightly behind it. Green bushes are visible in the right middle ground, with a modern building in the right background. Palm trees are seen in the left and central background. The man then pushes off with his left leg, causing him and the skateboard to move forward and slightly towards the left within the frame, remaining in the foreground. By the end of the sequence, the man is slightly left of center in the foreground, continuing to move forward. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light skin tone is skateboarding on a sidewalk. He wears a white tank top, black pants, a black knit hat, white socks, and black and white sneakers. He is initially bent over his skateboard and then pushes off with his left leg.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set on a concrete sidewalk in an urban environment, illuminated by ambient light. To the left, a street with parked cars, including a prominent black sedan, runs parallel to the sidewalk. A tall, metallic light pole stands near the curb. To the right, a modern building with a light-colored facade featuring vertically placed ornamental railings is visible, along with a cut-out garage entrance composed of numerous hexagonal patterns. Lush green bushes and several palm trees line the edge of the sidewalk and the area in front of the building. The sky appears bright. A fisheye lens effect is visible in the upper right and lower right corners.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
