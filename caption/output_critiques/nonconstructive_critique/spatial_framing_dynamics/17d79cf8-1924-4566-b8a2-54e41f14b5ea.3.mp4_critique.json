    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective looking down, the initial frame shows the person's feet in blue flip-flops positioned in the bottom center foreground. Their hands are also in the foreground, with the right hand holding a brick in the center-right and the left hand holding another brick in the bottom left. Numerous red bricks are scattered across the middle ground, predominantly in the top half and center of the frame. A green bowl containing a gray mixture sits in the bottom left middle ground, resting on the reddish-brown dirt ground that covers the foreground and middle ground. The camera then pans left and tilts slightly up as the person turns. In the final view, the feet remain in the bottom center foreground. The left hand still holds a brick in the bottom left foreground. The green bowl is now in the center-left middle ground, and a second, gray bowl with mixture is visible in the center-right middle ground. Bricks are now concentrated more towards the right middle ground. A partially constructed brick wall appears in the top left background/middle ground, with some greenery visible in the far left background. The camera maintains its high-angle position throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person engaged in construction work, captured from a head-mounted camera perspective. The individual, with medium skin tone, is wearing a light-colored shirt with rolled-up sleeves, purple patterned shorts with buttons, and blue flip-flops. They are holding a brick in their left hand while picking up bricks from the ground with their right hand. Red bricks are scattered on the ground, and a green bowl containing a gray mixture, likely cement, is nearby. In another part of the video, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, along with more bricks and construction materials on the ground, suggesting an outdoor construction site.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place outdoors during the day at a construction site with a focus on bricklaying. The ground is covered with reddish-brown dirt and scattered bricks, some whole and others broken. A person’s hands are visible, interacting with the bricks, indicating active construction work. Two round containers filled with gray cement are present, suggesting ongoing masonry tasks. In the background, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, while greenery is located on the ground outside the construction area, adding a natural element to the scene. The environment is dry. The overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor and construction activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

Numerous red bricks are scattered across the middle ground, mainly in the top half and center of the frame. A green bowl containing a gray mixture is located in the bottom left middle ground, resting on the brown earth that covers the area. The camera then shifts left as the person turns. In the final view, the feet remain in the middle ground. The left hand still holds a brick in the bottom left.
