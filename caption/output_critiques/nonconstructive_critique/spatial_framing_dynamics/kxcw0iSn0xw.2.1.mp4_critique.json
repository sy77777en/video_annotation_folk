    "pre_caption": "This wide shot initially frames a man on a scooter in the center-right middle ground, positioned before a wooden ramp that extends from the bottom-left foreground. Another man lies on the ground in the bottom-left foreground, at the base of the ramp. In the left middle ground, a third man stands near a silver truck, while a parking garage structure occupies the background. The main subject rides the scooter toward the center, launches off the ramp, and performs a front flip in the center of the frame, moving slightly from right to left in the air before landing. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man performing a stunt on a scooter in a parking garage. He wears a black helmet with white lettering, a black short-sleeved t-shirt, light-colored pants, and bright turquoise sneakers. His scooter has a gold-colored frame, red handlebar grips, and turquoise wheels. The man rides toward a small wooden ramp and launches into the air, performing a front flip while holding onto the scooter. He performs this trick over another man who is lying face-up on the ground at the end of the ramp, wearing blue jeans and dark boots. In the background, a third man stands near a silver pickup truck, holding up a phone as if to record the stunt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on the top level of a concrete parking garage under a clear blue sky on a sunny day. The ground is marked with white painted lines designating parking spaces, including the word \"COMPACT.\" A makeshift ramp made of light brown plywood is set up in an open area. In the background, a lower level of the parking structure is visible, containing parked vehicles such as a white van and a black pickup truck, some behind a metal fence and others outside of it. A person on a gold-colored scooter with turquoise wheels rides up the ramp, performs a backflip in mid-air, and lands. Another person is at the end of the ramp, while a third individual stands near a silver truck in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
