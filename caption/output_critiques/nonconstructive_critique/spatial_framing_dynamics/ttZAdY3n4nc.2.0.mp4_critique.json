    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot where a leaf-covered dirt path is positioned in the center, starting in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and receding into the background. On the left and right sides, dense trees and green foliage occupy the foreground and middle ground, forming a dark, natural tunnel over the path. This tunnel frames a bright, hazy area of light in the distant background, located in the center of the frame. Small, luminous particles float through the air, primarily in the foreground and middle ground on the right. The camera remains static at a height level with the path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot depicting a dirt path winding through a dense, dark forest. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and enchantment. Trees with thick, green foliage arch over the trail, forming a natural tunnel that recedes into the distance. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled light and long shadows across the leaf-strewn ground. At the far end of the arboreal tunnel, a brighter, hazy light glows, suggesting an opening or clearing just beyond view. Small, luminous particles, resembling fireflies or magical motes, drift through the air, further enhancing the scene's ethereal quality.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dirt path, covered in fallen brown leaves, leads through a dense forest. On either side of the path, there is lush green foliage and dark tree trunks. The branches of the trees overhead form a natural, dark tunnel. Sunlight filters through the canopy, creating patches of light and shadow on the ground. A gentle breeze lifts the fallen leaves into the air, adding movement to the serene scene. In the distance, the end of the path is illuminated by a brighter, hazy light. Small, bright yellow particles float through the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
