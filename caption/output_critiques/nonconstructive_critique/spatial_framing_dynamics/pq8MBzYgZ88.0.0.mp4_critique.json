    "pre_caption": "A full shot of a woman pushing a cart is initially positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a long hallway. The camera tracks backward at the same pace that the woman walks forward, maintaining her central position and consistent size within the frame. As the camera moves, a reception desk with another person appears in the left background. The camera continues to track backward through a doorway, revealing a man sitting in a chair in the left foreground as it enters a large hospital ward. The shot concludes with the woman and her cart in the center middle ground, framed by the man on the left and empty hospital beds on both sides of the room. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the entire shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a woman with dark, styled hair wearing a purple headscarf or headband, a white lab coat over an orange crew-neck dress, and dark heels. She is walking directly toward the camera while pushing a two-tiered, wheeled metal cart that holds electronic equipment on the top shelf and a clipboard on the bottom. As she proceeds down a hallway, a second woman in a light-colored nurse's uniform and cap is briefly visible in the background, sitting at a curved desk. The main subject then enters a room where a man in a dark uniform is sitting in a chair with his legs crossed, reading a document. He looks up as she enters and greets her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the day inside a brightly lit medical facility. The view moves steadily down a long, straight corridor with a light-colored floor, white walls, and sections of brown wood paneling. Along the hallway are several wooden doors, some with small windows and others without, and simple, round ceiling lights. The corridor passes a reception desk before opening into a spacious ward. This larger room contains multiple white, metal-framed hospital beds, some separated by green privacy curtains. Sunlight streams into the ward from large windows. A stainless steel medical cart on wheels is pushed through the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
