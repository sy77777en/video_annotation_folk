    "pre_caption": "The video captures an extreme wide shot of an urban construction site, showcasing the entire scene without focusing on specific objects. The camera starts with a view of the construction site in the foreground, positioned towards the bottom left of the frame, while two prominent cranes dominate the middle ground, extending upwards into the top right and center. Surrounding the construction site, modern high-rise buildings form the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame. As the camera pans to the left, the construction site shifts slightly towards the center, and the buildings on the left edge become more prominent. The sky, initially soft blue, gradually transitions to warm sunset hues, filling the top part of the frame. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned above the construction site, providing an aerial perspective throughout the sequence. The spatial dynamics highlight the expansive view of the developing area and the surrounding urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a static urban environment with a focus on the overall atmosphere and scale rather than a specific object. The scene includes multiple construction cranes towering over a developing area, surrounded by modern high-rise buildings. As the camera pans to the left, the sky transitions from a soft blue to a warm sunset hue. The emphasis is on the bustling city life and ongoing development, highlighting the expansive view and the interplay of natural and urban elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, presents an aerial view of an urban construction site. The setting is outdoors, featuring a bustling cityscape with several high-rise buildings surrounding the area. Prominent construction cranes tower over the site, where various materials and equipment are visible. As the camera pans to the left, the sky transitions from a soft blue to warm hues of orange and pink, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The buildings, primarily made of glass and steel, reflect the changing colors of the sky, adding a dynamic visual element. The overall atmosphere is one of development and transformation, with the construction site actively contributing to the evolving city skyline.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
