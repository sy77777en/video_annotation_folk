    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured at the subject's level, frames a silver sports car in the foreground, positioned on the left and extending toward the center of the frame. In the middle ground on the right, another vehicle is visible further down the street. The background consists of multi-story buildings, with an illuminated sign in the top-left middle ground and traffic signs on the right. The entire scene remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A silver, modified Nissan GT-R is positioned on the left side of a street at night, viewed from a rear three-quarters angle. The car is equipped with a large, black rear wing that has \"PANDEM\" written in white on its side plate, and it features a widebody kit with flared fenders. Its four signature circular taillights are illuminated in bright red, as is a single, smaller circular light at the bottom center of the rear bumper. A white Japanese license plate with green characters, including the number \"1 08,\" is visible on the trunk. In the midground to the right, a dark-colored minivan or SUV is seen from the rear with its taillights on.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A modified silver sports car is parked on the left side of a city street at night. The car's four circular taillights and a single lower light are illuminated in red, casting a glow on the dark asphalt below. It is equipped with a large black rear wing that has \"PANDEM\" written in white on its side plate. The Japanese license plate is visible on the rear. In the background, the street is lined with multi-story buildings, some with lit signs. The sign that reads \"Jackpot\" is located in the middle ground. Various traffic signs and another vehicle with its taillights on can be seen further down the dimly lit road.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
