    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially shows a tabby cat positioned center-right in the middle ground, standing on a large, reddish-brown rock formation that occupies the foreground and extends into the middle ground across the lower half of the frame. The cat then walks from right to left and slightly downwards across the rock, moving towards the center-left of the frame while remaining in the middle ground. In the background, an arid landscape with low-lying vegetation is visible above the rocks, and a clear blue sky fills the top portion of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tabby cat with dark stripes on its brownish-grey fur and a striped tail is on a large, reddish-brown, textured rock. The cat is oriented towards the left and is looking downwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in an arid, rocky landscape under a clear blue sky during the daytime. In the foreground, large, reddish-brown rocks with a coarse, granular texture dominate the view, bathed in abundant sunlight. A tabby cat is positioned on top of these sunlit rocks. In the background, a hazy expanse of low-lying green and brown vegetation stretches towards the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
