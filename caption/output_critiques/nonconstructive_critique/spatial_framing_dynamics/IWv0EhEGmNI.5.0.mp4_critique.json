    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a rifle is held in the foreground, occupying the bottom-center and bottom-right of the frame. Initially, an empty swimming pool is visible in the middle ground, extending from the center to the left side of the frame. A man briefly climbs out of the pool in the center-left middle ground before moving out of sight. A large pillar stands in the center-right middle ground. The camera moves forward, advancing past the pool on the left and toward the pillar, which shifts to occupy the center of the frame. As the camera continues forward, it moves past the pillar, revealing a potted plant to its right in the middle ground. Static HUD elements are present, with a vertical bar on the left, a crosshair in the center, and an ammunition count in the bottom right. The camera is positioned at eye level relative to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person wearing tactical gloves holds a black assault rifle equipped with a holographic sight. The scene is viewed through a green-tinted night vision filter, which includes a digital heads-up display showing an ammunition count of 7/82 and other on-screen graphics. The setting is a dark, indoor area containing what appears to be an empty, tiled swimming pool with metal handrails. A large, white, classical-style pillar stands near a potted plant. A man with a gun is seen walking up from the pool.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark indoor space viewed with a green night vision filter. The setting is an indoor pool area, featuring a rectangular, tiled pool with metal handrails along its edge. Large, white, classical-style pillars are present in the room, and a potted plant sits beside one of them. The perspective advances slowly past the pool and towards a pillar. Overlay elements are visible, including a heads-up display (HUD) with a central crosshair, a vertical bar graph on the left, a 100% battery icon in the lower left corner, and ammunition counters in the lower right corner. A grenade icon briefly appears on a box in the scene. The overlay text \"Checkpoint reached\" briefly appears at the top of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
