    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a subway station, capturing a man as he passes through the turnstiles. Initially, the man is positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, moving towards the center. As he approaches and goes through the turnstile, he transitions from the foreground into the middle ground. The turnstiles occupy the central area of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. Above the turnstiles, a red sign reading \"Red Line trains\" is prominently displayed in the upper middle part of the frame. The tiled pillars with blue and white patterns are situated on the left side, while additional turnstiles and station elements extend to the right. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective as the man moves from left to right across the frame. The overall spatial composition shifts subtly as the man exits the turnstile, leaving the foreground momentarily empty before the camera continues to capture the station's interior.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with short hair passing through the turnstile. He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes, with his back turned slightly towards the camera. The setting is a subway station, indicated by the signage for the \"Red Line trains\" above the turnstiles. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting within a subway station, focusing on the entrance to the Red Line trains. The environment is dimly lit, making it difficult to determine whether it's day or night. The scene features turnstiles and a prominent red sign indicating the train line. The station has a utilitarian design with tiled walls, including pillars covered with blue tiles, and fluorescent lighting. A person is seen passing through the turnstiles, adding a sense of human presence to the otherwise mechanical and structured environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
