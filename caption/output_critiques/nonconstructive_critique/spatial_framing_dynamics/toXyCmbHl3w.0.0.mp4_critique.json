    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a man seated in the driver's seat of a red sports car. The man occupies the center of the frame, with his upper body and face clearly visible. He is positioned in the foreground, while the car's interior, including the steering wheel and dashboard, is also in the foreground. The background consists of an urban street at night, with buildings and streetlights visible in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout the sequence. Initially, the windshield is clear, providing a direct view of the man and the street behind him. As the video progresses, raindrops appear on the windshield, slightly obscuring the view but not altering the man's position or the camera angle. The spatial framing remains consistent, with the man centrally framed and the urban environment consistently in the background. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man seated in the driver's seat of a red sports car. He has a light skin tone, short dark hair, and a beard. He is wearing a red jacket over a dark shirt and is focused on the road ahead, with a serious expression. The car's interior is visible, showing the steering wheel and part of the dashboard. In the second part of the video, raindrops are visible on the windshield, slightly obscuring the view of the man, but his features and attire remain discernible. The setting appears to be an urban environment at night.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a nighttime urban setting viewed from a locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to a car, maintaining a fixed perspective. The scene unfolds on a city street, characterized by modern buildings with large glass windows. The environment is dimly lit, with streetlights casting a soft glow on the pavement. The car, a sleek red vehicle, is central to the scene, with its glossy surface reflecting the ambient light. Raindrops are visible on the windshield, indicating recent or ongoing rain, adding texture to the glass. The street is relatively empty, suggesting a quiet night, with the car moving smoothly along the road. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the focus on the car's journey through the cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
