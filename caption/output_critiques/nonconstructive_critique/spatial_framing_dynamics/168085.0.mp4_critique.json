    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot. The video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a large, flat-topped mountain from a high-angle, aerial perspective. The mountain, with a waterfall emerging from a central crevice, is the primary element, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. The waterfall descends into a dark canyon located in the center-bottom of the frame. A small river is visible at the very bottom-center, winding through the foreground forest. The central mountain is flanked by lush green slopes on the left and right sides in the middle ground. In the background, layers of distant mountains extend across the top of the frame, beneath a hazy sky. The composition remains fixed throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a breathtaking aerial view of a massive, flat-topped mountain, known as a tepui. Its surface is covered in vibrant green vegetation and is uniquely split by a central crevice from which a spectacular waterfall plunges into the deep, shadowed canyon below, with the surrounding vista filled with rolling green mountains fading into a hazy horizon. There is no main subject because the focus is on the immense scale and majestic beauty of the natural environment itself. The shot's purpose is to convey the awe-inspiring atmosphere of the location, with the unique geological formation and waterfall serving as the central elements of the composition.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of what appears to be Angel Falls in Venezuela during the daytime. The scene is dominated by a massive, flat-topped mountain, or tepui, whose summit is covered in vibrant green vegetation and split by a central crevice. From this crevice, a slender white waterfall plunges down the sheer, layered rock face of the cliff into a dark canyon below. The tepui is situated within a vast, mountainous landscape covered in dense green forest, with distant mountain ranges fading into a light haze under a partly cloudy sky. A river can be seen emerging from the base of the falls and winding through the jungle.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
