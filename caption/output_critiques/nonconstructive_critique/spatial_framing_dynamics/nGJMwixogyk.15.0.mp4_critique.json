    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a group of people and the surrounding street scene. At the start, a person with a stroller is positioned in the bottom center foreground, close to the camera’s height, and quickly moves forward, exiting the frame. Two women in kimonos walk side by side on the right side of the street, occupying the middle ground and right-center of the frame as they move away from the camera. A woman in white stands near a shop entrance on the left, positioned in the middle ground and left side of the frame. Other people, including a man in a patterned shirt, are visible further along the street in the background, distributed across the center and right. The camera remains at an eye-level height, moving smoothly forward along the street, causing the foreground subjects to shift out of view while middle- and background subjects gradually become more prominent in the frame. The shops and buildings line both sides of the frame, creating a sense of depth and leading lines that draw the viewer’s eye toward the background, where green hills are visible above the rooftops.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a man in yellow clothing on the far right, wearing a towel on his head and a mask. As the camera moves forward, he exits the frame. Initially, a man and a woman walk towards the camera in the center; the woman on the left wears a white dress and a mask, while the man on the right is in a black top with a white pattern and dark pants. He exits the frame from the left side. Behind them, a man in a black short-sleeved shirt and blue shorts pushes a stroller with a young girl, accompanied by a woman in black clothing and green pants, also wearing a mask. Further back, two women holding umbrellas walk towards the camera. After they exit the frame from the left, two women in kimonos appear, walking side by side on the right side of the street. As the camera continues forward, the street becomes less crowded, with only a few pedestrians visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves along a narrow outdoor street lined with small shops and traditional-style buildings under a clear blue sky in the late afternoon. The street is paved with textured stone and flanked by storefronts featuring awnings in shades of beige, orange, and yellow, with some displaying colorful merchandise and signs in Japanese. The buildings are constructed from wood and concrete, with sloped roofs and a mix of natural and painted finishes. Shadows stretch across the ground, indicating the low angle of the sun. In the background, green hills rise behind the buildings, and as the perspective gradually moves closer, the hills transition from the background to the middleground, becoming more prominent in the scene. The overall setting is brightly lit with warm sunlight. People walk along the street, some carrying bags or umbrellas, and their placement adds a sense of movement and daily activity to the setting. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

The description of the two women in kimonos is inaccurate regarding their direction of movement and their eventual exit from the frame. The caption also mischaracterizes the camera's movement and fails to describe the spatial transition of the background elements toward the end of the video. Furthermore, the spatial positioning and movement of the man in the patterned shirt are described incorrectly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene. In the foreground, a person with a stroller is positioned in the bottom center and moves diagonally to the left, exiting the frame. On the right side, two women in kimonos walk side by side, moving toward the camera and eventually exiting to the left. A woman in white stands near a shop entrance on the left, remaining stationary throughout the scene. A man in a patterned shirt is visible in the background, moving from the left to the right side of the frame. The camera maintains an eye-level height and pans smoothly to the right, allowing the foreground subjects to exit while the middle- and background elements, including shops and buildings, become more prominent. This movement creates a dynamic sense of depth, with the viewer's eye drawn toward the background, where green hills rise above the rooftops, becoming more visible as the video progresses.",
