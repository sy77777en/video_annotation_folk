    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a gloved hand holding a cylindrical toggle switch is positioned in the left foreground. The hand interacts with a dark control panel that occupies the center and right of the frame in the middle ground. On the panel, the text \"PULL LEVER DOWN\" and three yellow arrows are located in the center. To the right of the text is an ON/OFF switch, with a red light at the top right and a partially visible warning sign at the bottom right. The hand moves the toggle switch downwards, following the direction indicated by the arrows. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's right hand, covered in a smooth, white glove, grips a small, black toggle switch with a distinct yellow band near one end and a metallic, silver-colored tip. The hand is moving a lever or joystick downward on a dark, industrial-looking control panel. The panel features yellow text that reads \"PULL LEVER DOWN\" above three yellow, downward-pointing arrows. To the right of this, there is a switch with \"ON\" and \"OFF\" labels, and a red rectangular light is visible at the top of the panel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a gloved hand moves the toggle switch on a dark control panel from the up position to the down position. The panel features a red indicator light at the top and bold white text that reads \"PULL LEVER DOWN\" next to three large, yellow, downward-pointing arrows. At the bottom of the panel, a yellow warning sign is partially visible. The overall scene is characterized by low, cool-toned lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
