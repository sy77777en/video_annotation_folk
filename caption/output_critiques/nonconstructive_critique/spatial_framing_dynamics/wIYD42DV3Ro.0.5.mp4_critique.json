    "pre_caption": "A wide, high-angle shot frames a pack of horses and jockeys in the middle ground, positioned in the center-left of the frame as they race along a brown dirt track that curves from the bottom left to the top right. The camera pans to the right, following the collective movement of the horses as they navigate the turn, shifting their position across the frame toward the center-right. A white fence in the middle ground separates the track from a green grass infield that occupies the bottom right foreground. In the top left background, an outer fence and a building are visible. An informational graphic is stationary in the bottom left foreground, with a timer and logo fixed in the top right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A high-angle shot captures a group of horses and jockeys competing in the 148th Kentucky Derby. The jockeys, wearing colorful silks in red, blue, yellow, green, and purple, are crouched low as they race around a bend on a brown dirt track. An on-screen graphic in the lower-left corner lists several competing horses, such as \"EPICENTER\" and \"MESSIER,\" along with their corresponding numbers and betting odds. A timer in the upper-right corner indicates a time of 1:10.34 for the 3/4 mile mark.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, a horse race unfolds on a wide dirt track during the daytime. The brown dirt track curves to the right, bordered on the inside by a white fence and a green grass infield. In the background, another fence and a building with a large sign are visible. A large pack of horses with jockeys in brightly colored silks gallops around the turn. Overlays are present on the screen. In the top right corner, a timer reads \"3/4 MILE 1:10.34\" next to a network logo. In the bottom left, a graphic for the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" displays a list of horses, their numbers, odds, and jockey silk designs, identifying one as the \"FAVORITE.\"**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
