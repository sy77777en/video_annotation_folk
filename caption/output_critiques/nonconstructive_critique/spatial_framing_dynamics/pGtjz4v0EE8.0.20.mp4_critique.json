    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot capturing the ornate facade of a cathedral, which fills the entire frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking across at the building. In the upper half of the frame, rows of statues are set within niches. A large triangular pediment is positioned in the lower-center and left, while a large rose window occupies the bottom right. The only movement within the static shot is the slow progression of long, dark shadows creeping across the facade from left to right, indicating a time-lapse of the sun's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a static, detailed view of a magnificent Gothic cathedral's facade. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the grandeur of the structure rather than a specific subject. Bathed in the golden light of the sun, the building's intricate polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, is thrown into high relief by deep, slowly shifting shadows. The composition highlights rows of sculpted figures standing in ornate, pointed-arch niches, the detailed relief carvings within a large triangular pediment over a portal, and the complex tracery of a large rose window on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A detailed view captures the ornate, polychrome marble facade of the Florence Cathedral. The Gothic Revival architecture features intricate patterns of white and dark green marble. Rows of white statues stand within individual, pointed-arch niches along the upper portion of the building. Below, a large triangular pediment above an entrance is filled with detailed relief sculptures. To the right, a large, circular rose window with elaborate tracery is visible. The entire scene is illuminated by golden sunlight, which casts long, sharp shadows that slowly creep across the detailed stonework in a time-lapse effect.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
