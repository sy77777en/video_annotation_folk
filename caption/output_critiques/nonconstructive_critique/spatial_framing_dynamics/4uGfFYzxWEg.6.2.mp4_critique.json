    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a stylized white figure from behind, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. This main subject is flanked by other stylized grey figures, also in the middle ground: one to the left, and two to the right. In the background, a wall of television screens occupies the upper portion of the frame. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level. A text overlay reading \"[1,8]\" is visible in the bottom left corner of the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a stylized, low-polygon figure of a man, seen from behind in the center of a dark room. He is rendered in a solid, matte white color and appears to be wearing a top that might be a short-sleeved shirt. He stands facing away from the viewer, looking towards a wall of television screens. Surrounding him are other similarly stylized, low-polygon figures rendered in a darker grey. In front and to his left, another man-like figure is slightly turned towards him. In front and to his right, a figure in what appears to be a hooded jacket holds a hand to its face, while another figure is partially visible on the far right. The screens in the background show multiple blurry, repeated images of a person's face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indoor setting, several stylized, low-poly figures stand before a large wall of television monitors. The figures, rendered in a simple, polygonal style, are seen from behind and are silhouetted against the glow of the screens. The wall features two rows of monitors, each displaying a blurry image of a person. The room is dimly lit, with the screens providing the main source of illumination. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"[1,8]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
