    "pre_caption": "This wide shot features a bald man in a blue shirt sitting on a brown leather couch in the middle ground, positioned on the right side of the frame. In the background center, another man in a red t-shirt emerges from a doorway. Behind the seated man and to the left, a mint-green tool cabinet and a workbench occupy the background, while a small kitchenette is visible in the background on the far right. The man in the red t-shirt walks from the background into the middle ground, moving towards the left side of the frame and approaching the seated man. The seated man remains on the couch, gesturing and turning his head slightly to his right to face the other man. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A muscular Black man with short hair, wearing a mauve t-shirt and dark jeans, walks out of a doorway holding a red can and a green bottle. In the middleground, a light-skinned, bald man in a light blue button-down shirt and grey trousers is seated on a brown leather couch. He sits upright with his hands clasped in his lap. In the second half of the video, this seated man speaks while facing the camera, then looks slightly to his right as the other man approaches.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a rustic, wood-paneled room during the daytime. In the middleground, a man in a light blue shirt sits on a brown leather couch. The background features a workshop area with a large, mint-green tool cabinet mounted on the wall, its doors open to reveal a neat arrangement of tools. A wooden workbench with various items sits in front of the cabinet. To the right, a small kitchenette with a white sink is visible, and a framed picture of a lighthouse hangs on the wooden wall. Another man in a pink t-shirt walks from the background to the middleground through a doorway, holding a red can and a green bottle. The room is illuminated by soft, natural light from several windows.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
