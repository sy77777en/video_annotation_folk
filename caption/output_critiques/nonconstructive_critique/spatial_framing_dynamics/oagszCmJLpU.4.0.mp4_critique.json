    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, focusing on the scenery. A dark, silhouetted landscape is positioned in the foreground along the bottom of the static frame. The middle ground and background are dominated by a massive formation of dark storm clouds that fills the upper two-thirds of the scene. A particularly dense, dark cloud mass occupies the left and center of the frame. Intermittent flashes of lightning occur in the background, primarily within the clouds in the top left and upper center regions. A brighter area of the sky glows in the background on the right side, situated between the horizon and the overlying clouds. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up towards the vast expanse of the storm.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at dusk or dawn. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. The sky is dominated by a massive, turbulent formation of storm clouds, tinged with deep purple and violet hues. Intermittent flashes of lightning illuminate the clouds from within, revealing their complex, layered structure, while a brighter, pinkish glow emanates from the horizon, creating a stark contrast with the dark, ominous cloud mass that looms over a silhouetted landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dramatic thunderstorm unfolds at dusk over a silhouetted landscape. The sky is dominated by massive, dark purple storm clouds that swirl and layer upon each other. Intermittent flashes of lightning illuminate the clouds from within, casting a lavender glow across the turbulent sky. The ground below remains a dark, undefined silhouette against the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

A dark, silhouetted landscape stretches across the bottom of the static frame, extending into the middle ground. The scene is dominated by a massive formation of dark storm clouds that occupy a significant portion of the sky. A particularly dense, dark cloud mass is prominent in the left and center of the frame. Intermittent flashes of lightning illuminate various parts of the clouds, adding to the storm's intensity. A brighter area of the sky is visible on the right side, nestled between the horizon and the overlying clouds. The camera is positioned at a low angle, capturing the vast expanse of the stormy sky.",
