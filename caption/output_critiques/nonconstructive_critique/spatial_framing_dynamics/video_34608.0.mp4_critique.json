    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on a mountainous landscape. Initially, a large, green, conical mountain peak is positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Thick white clouds are in the foreground and middle ground, swirling around the base and sides of this peak, particularly on the right side of the frame. In the background, the tips of two other distant peaks are visible in the top-center, emerging from the sea of clouds under an overcast sky that fills the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high aerial height level with the upper part of the main peak, moves steadily forward and slightly to the right. As it advances, the main peak shifts towards the left of the frame, and the camera flies alongside its slope, eventually moving into the dense clouds which increasingly fill the frame from the right and bottom, obscuring the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is an aerial landscape scenery shot that glides alongside a majestic, conical mountain peak covered in a dense, lush green forest. Thick, white clouds and fog swirl around the mountain's base and sides, creating a serene and ethereal \"sea of clouds\" effect, with the tips of other distant peaks visible in the background under a bright, overcast sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the grand scale and atmospheric mood of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of nature rather than a specific object or entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a mountain range on an overcast day. A prominent, conical peak covered in dense green forest occupies the center of the view, its summit ridge visible above a thick layer of white clouds. The clouds swirl around the mountain's base and sides, obscuring the landscape below. In the distance, other bluish-gray peaks emerge from the sea of fog. The camera moves slowly forward, flying alongside the main peak and into the enveloping clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
