    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of two subjects, a young person and an older man, both occupying the central area of the frame. They are positioned side by side, with the young person slightly to the left and the older man to the right. Both are in the foreground, with their upper bodies and faces clearly visible. In the background, which is out of focus, there is a lab worker situated towards the top right, further back in the scene. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the sequence. The overall composition keeps the two main subjects as the focal point while subtly including the background activity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young person and an older man, both wearing white hooded suits with orange stripes. They have goggles resting on their foreheads. The young person, with short blonde hair visible under the hood, has a fair skin tone and a focused expression. The older man, with a mustache and a fair skin tone, appears concerned. Both subjects are facing forward, suggesting they are looking at something directly ahead.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a stark, clinical atmosphere. The environment is predominantly white, featuring smooth surfaces and minimalistic design elements. Two individuals are present, dressed in white suits with orange stripes, wearing goggles on their heads. In the background, a lab worker in white is conducting experiments alone. The lighting is bright and even, contributing to the clean and controlled ambiance of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
