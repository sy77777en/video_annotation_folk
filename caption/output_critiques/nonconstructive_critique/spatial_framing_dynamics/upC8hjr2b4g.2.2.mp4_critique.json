    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of several low-poly figures. A figure is positioned in the foreground on the left, with only its arms and hands visible over a desk. In the middle ground, left of center, a woman with long hair sits in profile at her own desk, facing right. In the background on the right, a computer monitor emits a vertical glow next to a small orange cup. The camera then slowly pulls back and pans slightly to the right, transitioning into a full shot. This movement reveals more of the foreground figure and the surrounding dark environment, while the woman in the middle ground shifts more toward the center of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, three light-gray, low-polygon figures are shown sitting at desks. In the very foreground, a figure is partially visible from the side, with only the arms shown in the frame. Further back, a second figure, a man, is seen from behind and to the right, with his faceted hands positioned as if on a keyboard. In the very background, a woman, identifiable by her long, faceted hair, sits in profile on a dark chair. She is also positioned at a desk, facing a glowing computer monitor. All figures are rendered in a geometric, sculptural style, with visible flat planes making up their forms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, indoor environment where three white, low-poly figures are present. In the foreground, only the arm of one figure is visible. A man is seated in the middleground, while a woman with long hair is positioned further back. The figures have a faceted, geometric, statue-like appearance. The surrounding space is predominantly black, contrasted by a thin red light strip running along the base of the furniture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
