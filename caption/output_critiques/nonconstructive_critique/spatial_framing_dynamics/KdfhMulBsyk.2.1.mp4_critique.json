    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, forward-moving perspective, focusing on the landscape. A dark asphalt road, marked with a white center line, occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground at the bottom and receding into the background. It is flanked on the left and right by arid, light-brown terrain in the foreground and middle ground. A pile of rocks sits in the middle ground on the right, with sparse vegetation visible in the background on the far right. A small, silhouetted figure stands in the distant background, centered on the road at the crest of a hill, under a clear blue sky that fills the top portion of the frame. The camera moves steadily forward along the road, causing the foreground to rush past and the elements in the middle ground to expand and move toward the edges of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a long, straight asphalt road that recedes into the horizon. The road, marked by a white center line, cuts through a vast and arid landscape characterized by sandy, light-brown terrain and scattered rocky outcrops under a clear, deep blue sky. There is no distinct main subject; the camera's forward-moving perspective emphasizes the scale and desolation of the environment itself. A person on a motorcycle travels along the highway, eventually disappearing from view after cresting a ridge, accentuating the vastness and isolation of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The view is from a camera mounted low on the front of a vehicle moving along a straight, paved road that cuts through an arid, open landscape under a clear, blue sky. The dark asphalt road features a white dashed center line and extends forward over a slight incline into the distance. Flanking the road is dry, light-brown earth, with a pile of rocks on the right shoulder and sparse, low vegetation visible further away. Two short white pillars stand on each side of the road. A person on a motorcycle travels forward along the road, eventually disappearing over the ridge at the distant crest of the hill.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a slightly elevated, forward-moving perspective, emphasizing the expansive landscape. A dark gray road, marked with a white center line, occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground at the bottom and receding into the background. It is flanked on the left and right by arid, light-brown terrain that stretches from the foreground into the background. A pile of rocks is visible in the background on the right, with sparse vegetation scattered in the distance on the far right. A small, silhouetted figure stands in the distant background, slightly off-center on the road at the crest of a hill, under a clear blue sky that fills the top portion of the frame. The camera moves smoothly forward along the road, creating a dynamic sense of motion as the foreground elements rush past and the middle ground elements expand and shift toward the edges of the frame. The figure in the background remains stationary, adding a sense of scale to the scene.",
