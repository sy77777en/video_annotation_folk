    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a woman positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, with a microphone in the bottom center foreground. The background consists of a red running track and a green field inside a stadium. The camera then zooms out to a medium shot, revealing two additional women standing to the right of the first. In the final composition, the first woman is on the left, the second is in the center, and the third is on the right, all occupying the middle ground. A hand holding a microphone enters from the right foreground, pointed towards the group. The stadium setting remains in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up of a Black woman with long black braids, some of which are adorned with red and yellow beads, and a yellow butterfly clip in her hair. She is draped in an American flag, revealing a blue and white striped top and a silver necklace with a circular pendant underneath. She smiles as she speaks into a black microphone. The shot then pulls back to reveal two other Black women standing to the right of the original woman, positioned on the left side of the frame. The woman in the middle has her dark hair pulled back, is also draped in an American flag over a blue top, and is laughing while holding a water bottle. The woman on the far right wears a white headband in her dark hair and is draped in an American flag over a blue top with the name \"TERRY\" in white letters. All three women are smiling. A hand holding a black microphone with the NBC logo alongside the word \"Sports\" is extended towards them from the right side of the frame, indicating they are being interviewed as a group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set at night within a large, brightly lit athletics stadium. A red running track encircles a green grass infield, with multi-tiered red and white spectator stands visible in the background, though the seats appear mostly empty. Blue banners with white \"TDK\" logos line the edge of the track. Three female athletes, draped in red, white, and blue American flags, are being interviewed near the track as a microphone with a \"Sports\" logo is held up to them. The stadium lights illuminate the scene, while a few people on the field and around the track remain softly out of focus, enhancing the scene's realism.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up of a Black woman wearing an American flag, speaking in an interview in a stadium. The camera then zooms out to reveal a group of Black women, all wearing American flags, showing their upper bodies. There is a hand holding a microphone in the foreground on the right of the frame, suggesting these Black women are being interviewed together.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
