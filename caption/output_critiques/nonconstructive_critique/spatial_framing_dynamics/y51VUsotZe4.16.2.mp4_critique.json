    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot, with a woman positioned in the right foreground, her profile facing left as she eats. A small, white-topped table is visible in the center-left middle ground, with a stool in the bottom-left foreground. In the left background, two men are seated at a table. Further to their right, in the center background, two more men are seated at another table, and a fifth person in a light top is visible in the more distant center-left background. A counter area with shelves occupies the top-left to top-center background, while a tiled floor extends from the bottom of the frame into the background. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with dark, shoulder-length hair is seen in a close-up profile, actively eating noodles, some of which are visible in her mouth. She wears a dark purple, patterned top and has wide eyes. In the background, several men are seated at tables. On the left, a man in a dark collared shirt is visible. Next to him sits another man wearing a dark jacket over a dark shirt. Further to their right, a man in a dark-colored shirt and another man in a reddish-brown collared shirt are also seated. In the more distant background, a person, likely male, in a dark top is present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds indoors within a small restaurant, characterized by a pervasive, strong green artificial light that casts a dark ambiance over the setting. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern, and the space is furnished with small, white-topped tables on dark legs, accompanied by simple stools. Simple white sofas are located on the left side of the scene. In the background, other patrons are visible at their tables, and the wall features shelves stocked with items. The clock is positioned on the signboard.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
