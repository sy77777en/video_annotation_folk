    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a high angle. A large wooden contraption dominates the foreground, extending from the bottom left to the center of the frame. A dark spherical ball rests on a ramp in the bottom left foreground. In the middle ground, an asphalt runway stretches across the scene from left to right. A small model biplane is positioned in the upper right, suspended from the wooden structure, with a white bag hanging below it in the center-right. The background features large buildings on the right and distant mountains on the left horizon, all under a partly cloudy sky that fills the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of an airfield under a partly cloudy sky. A large, complex wooden contraption, resembling a transportation system, occupies the foreground on dry, grassy ground beside a wide asphalt runway. A small, vintage-style biplane is suspended from the structure, with a white bag hanging underneath it. The wide-angle perspective captures the expansive environment, including distant buildings and mountains, emphasizing the scale of the scene rather than focusing on a single subject. The focus is on establishing the setting and the relationship between the various elements within the vast, open space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a wide, paved airfield under a partly cloudy sky. In the foreground, a large and intricate wooden structure, resembling a transportation machine, dominates the view. It is constructed from light-colored wooden beams and features a ramp, a crane-like arm, and a vertical post. A dark, spherical ball is positioned to slide down a ramp on this structure. Nearby, a separate unit features a small model biplane positioned at the top, with a white bag hanging from a string. The paved runway extends into the distance, flanked by dry, grassy areas. In the background, a large building, possibly a hangar, is visible, along with several large, dark, geometric structures and distant mountains on the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
