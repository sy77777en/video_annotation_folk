    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot. The scene opens with a low-angle view, framing the large dome of a basilica in the top-left and center of the frame against a cloudy sky in the top-right background. The camera then simultaneously tilts down and trucks to the left. This movement reveals the full facade of the basilica, which occupies the left and center middle ground, and a wide staircase leading down from it. In the bottom foreground, a canal and several moored gondolas come into view. A second, simpler building is positioned in the middle ground on the right. The camera angle becomes more level relative to the base of the basilica, and the slow, continuous trucking motion to the left persists throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the architectural grandeur and atmosphere of a Venetian setting, focusing on a magnificent, domed basilica constructed from light-colored stone, adorned with statues and intricate carvings. The dome is a slightly darker gray compared to the rest of the building. A wide staircase leads up to a large, dark green central door, with a simpler building featuring a red-tiled roof visible to the right. In the foreground, a canal is visible, with dark gondolas moored in the water at the foot of the stairs. Small figures of people on the steps and in the vicinity highlight the monumental scale of the main structure under an overcast sky. Initially, the camera is angled upwards, focusing on the dome and sky, before tilting down to a level angle to reveal the canal and gondolas. The camera is slowly moving to the left, suggesting it is traveling along the canal.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene from a canal in Venice captures the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute under a cloudy sky. The grand, white stone church features an ornate facade with numerous statues, columns, and a large, dark arched door, all beneath a massive grey dome. A wide set of stone steps descends from the basilica's entrance to the edge of the murky green water. In the foreground, several dark blue gondolas are moored to wooden poles. To the right of the main church, a simpler building with a red-tiled roof is visible. The perspective slowly trucks left, revealing more of the steps and the boats at the water's edge, where a few people are seen walking.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
