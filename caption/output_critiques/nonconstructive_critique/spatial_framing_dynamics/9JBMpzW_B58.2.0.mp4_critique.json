    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot presented as an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective, looking forward from the bow of a container ship. The ship's deck, stacked with containers, occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. The ocean fills the middle ground, stretching from the ship's bow to the horizon line. The sky dominates the top portion of the frame in the background. The camera remains stationary relative to the ship, which moves forward, creating a dynamic where the clouds streak rapidly across the sky in a time-lapse effect. A watermark is visible as a foreground overlay in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic seascape scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship. The focus is not on a specific subject but rather on the immense scale of the natural environment and the feeling of a journey across the open water. The ship, with its stacks of blue, red, and beige containers filling both the foreground and extending into the midground, enhances the depth and perspective of the scene. Above, the deep blue sky is filled with clouds that streak and billow rapidly, their motion accelerated to create a powerful sense of passing time, while the vast, smooth ocean stretches out to a hazy horizon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on the bow of a container ship, the vessel moves across the open ocean. Rows of stacked shipping containers in shades of blue, red, and beige fill the foreground and extend into the midground. The dark sea stretches to a flat horizon under a dramatic, deep blue sky. In a time-lapse effect, fast-moving white and grey clouds streak across the sky, creating a sense of rapid movement. An overlay in the form of a watermark with the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" is visible at the lower right corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
