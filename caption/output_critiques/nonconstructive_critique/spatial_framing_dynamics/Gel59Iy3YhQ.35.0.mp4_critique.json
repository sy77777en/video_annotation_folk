    "pre_caption": "A high-angle wide shot frames an elevated, ruined courtyard. Initially, a small, fox-like character stands in the bottom left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the center of the frame, a large, stone-like enemy assembles itself from a pile of rocks. As the enemy forms, it remains in the center and attacks, sending orange energy beams across the arena. The fox character moves from the bottom left to the center-right of the frame to dodge the attack before closing in on the enemy in the center to strike back. The camera remains static throughout the sequence, maintaining its overhead perspective. Game interface elements are overlaid in the foreground in the corners of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two main subjects. The first is a large figure with a brown-green color and a non-humanoid appearance. It has an imposing presence and is constructed from angular shapes, featuring three illuminated objects resembling eyes in blue, pink, and green. The second subject is a smaller, fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic. This creature is positioned near the larger figure, highlighting a stark contrast in size and form. Both subjects exhibit a stylized, animated design, contributing to their atypical and striking appearances.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a battle unfolds within an elevated, outdoor courtyard made of green stone. The arena features a floor of green grass, small white flowers, and blue-tiled pathways, with ruined pillars in the surroundings. A tiered stone platform sits in the center, and a small hexagonal pool of water is located on the left. A small, orange, fox-like character faces a large, blocky, stone-like enemy that assembles itself from a pile of rocks. The enemy attacks with a sword, which generates sweeping orange laser beams when swung, while the fox character dodges and strikes back, causing bright white flashes on impact. Overlays on the screen include a heads-up display with three vertical bars in pink, red, and blue at the bottom left, item icons in the top right, and the enemy's name, \"Garden Knight,\" in the bottom right. The scene is framed with black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The initial position of the fox-like character is described incorrectly, and its depth is wrongly stated as 'middle ground'. The description of the enemy's attack is incomplete, as it omits that the camera moves to keep the enemy centered and that it swings a sword. Consequently, the statement that the camera remains static is incorrect. The description of the fox character's movement also begins from the wrong starting position. Finally, the game interface elements are incorrectly described as being in the foreground.",
