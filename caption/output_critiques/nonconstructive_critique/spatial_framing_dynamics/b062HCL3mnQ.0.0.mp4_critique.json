    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a woman sits at a table in the center middle ground of a retro diner. She is seated in a red and white booth that occupies the center and right middle ground. In the background, a red Coca-Cola vending machine and a neon \"ROCK 'N' ROLL\" sign are positioned in the center. To the left in the background, a Coca-Cola poster and a traffic light are visible. On the right side of the background, framed photographs hang on the wall. The black and white checkered floor extends from the foreground to the middle ground, with a portion of another red booth visible in the bottom right foreground. The camera is positioned at the woman's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with fair skin and dark hair sits alone at a table in a diner booth. Her dark hair is styled in a 1950s fashion, pulled back from her face and adorned with a pink bow. She wears a vintage-style dress with a full, floral-patterned skirt in shades of blue and green, a light blue collar, and short sleeves. With a pensive expression, she rests her clasped hands on the white tabletop, looking slightly off-camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime scene unfolds inside a retro-style diner featuring a black and white checkered floor. Red and white vinyl booths are paired with white-topped tables against dark, wood-paneled walls. The dimly lit space is decorated with a vintage red Coca-Cola vending machine, a glowing red and white neon \"ROCK 'N' ROLL\" sign, and a Coca-Cola advertisement poster. In a corner, a traffic light with illuminated red, yellow, and green lenses is visible, while framed black and white photographs adorn the wall. A woman in a floral, vintage-style dress sits alone at a table.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
