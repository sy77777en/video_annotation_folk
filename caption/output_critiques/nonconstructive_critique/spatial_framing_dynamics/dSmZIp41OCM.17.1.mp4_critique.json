    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a pumpkin-headed character is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground. To the right, a garden plot occupies the middle ground, while fences are visible in the background on the left and top of the frame. UI elements are situated in the foreground at the bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right. The character walks from the middle ground toward the foreground. As they move, the camera pulls back, revealing a circular stone well that moves from the bottom edge to occupy the foreground of the scene. The character stops in front of the well, and a text prompt appears over it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid character with an orange, pumpkin-like head stands in a grassy area. The head features glowing, carved, oval-shaped eyes and a carved, smiling mouth. This figure is clad in a long, grey, hooded cloak that obscures its body, revealing only thin, stick-like legs. The scene includes a square garden plot containing small green sprouts, enclosed by a white picket fence and a border of round stones. Nearby is a circular stone well with a wooden roof structure and a bucket suspended by a rope. A user interface is visible, with a gold coin icon and the number 160 in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom-center, and two vertical glass tubes on the right, one of which is partially filled with a blue liquid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video, a small, cloaked character with an orange, pumpkin-like head stands in a grassy yard at night. The scene, rendered in a stylized, cartoonish aesthetic with thick black outlines, is illuminated by a warm, orange light. The character walks from a tilled garden plot, which is enclosed by a white picket fence and contains rows of small green sprouts, towards the foreground. As they approach, the camera pulls back to reveal a stone well with a wooden roof and a bucket, situated in the center of a circular brick path. A heads-up display is present, showing a coin icon with the number 160 in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom-center, and two vertical vials in the bottom-right, one of which is partially filled with a blue liquid. A text prompt reading \"HOLD [F]\" appears over the well as the character gets near.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
