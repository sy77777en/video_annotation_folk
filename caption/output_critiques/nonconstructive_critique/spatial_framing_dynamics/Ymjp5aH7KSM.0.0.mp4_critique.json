    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing a man in a leather jacket in profile on the left side of the frame in the foreground. Across a table from him, a bearded man is positioned in the middle ground on the right, facing toward the camera. The table itself occupies the bottom center of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, holding a paper, a glass, and a military cap. In the background, a window is visible on the top left. The camera then performs a slow, clockwise orbital movement around the subjects. This motion shifts the man in the jacket to the center foreground, showing his back, while the bearded man moves to the left side of the frame, turning into a profile view. By the end of the shot, the jacketed man's back is in the right foreground, and the bearded man is in the left middle ground, with background windows now visible on the right. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two men are seated across from each other at a wooden table in a dimly lit room. The man initially on the left is light-skinned and middle-aged, with styled brown hair. He wears a black leather jacket and is shown in profile, leaning forward to write on a paper. The second man, seated opposite him, is also light-skinned and middle-aged, with short dark hair and a full dark beard. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt with suspenders and leans forward with one fist resting on top of the other, looking intently at the man who is writing. As the view circles around them, the man in the jacket is seen from behind, while the bearded man is shown in profile, with both men maintaining their positions and focused interaction across the table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a dimly lit, rustic room during the day. A large wooden table serves as the focal point, holding a sheet of white paper, an inkwell, a glass of water, a German military-style peaked cap, and dark gloves. One of the men is holding a pen and writing on the paper. The two men are seated near each other, separated by the corner of the table. Light from small-paned windows filters into the dark interior, which contains a wooden staircase and other simple furnishings in the background. The perspective slowly shifts, orbiting the table and altering the view of the two figures and the room around them.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins by focusing on the upper bodies of two people sitting at a table in the room—one is seated sideways, and the other faces the camera. As the camera rotates around the table, the perspective shifts from one person’s back and one side view to two side views, with the two characters swapping positions on the left and right sides of the frame. Overall, it is a medium shot of the two individuals.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
