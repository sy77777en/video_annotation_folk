    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a high-angle view of a tabletop. A hand holding a glass occupies the left foreground, positioned over a napkin. In the middle ground, a spilled olive is located near the top of the frame, while a small pink elephant is on the right. As the elephant walks toward the right, the camera rapidly zooms in, transitioning the shot to an extreme close-up that centers on the elephant's eye, which ultimately fills the entire frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stylized, cartoon-like scene with an orange background, a red-colored hand holds a short glass filled with a swirling liquid that appears uniform with bright cyan and magenta patterns, influenced by the color of the glass. To the right, a small, solid pink elephant wearing a tiny yellow party hat walks across the surface. The video zooms in to a close-up of the elephant's single visible eye, which has a blue and purple iris. Near the elephant, a green olive on a red toothpick lies in a small, brown puddle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, animated scene set on a solid orange surface, a reddish-pink hand holds a glass containing a swirling liquid of cyan and pink. The hand holds the glass above a white napkin stained with a wet ring. Nearby, a spilled brown puddle surrounds a toothpick with a green olive. A small, pink elephant wearing a yellow party hat walks to the right across the surface, as the camera zooms into its single, detailed eye with a blue and purple iris.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
