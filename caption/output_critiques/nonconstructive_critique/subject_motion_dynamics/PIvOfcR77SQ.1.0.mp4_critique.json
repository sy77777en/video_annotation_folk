It continues to move forward and pan right, passing various pieces of furniture and a wooden door. The camera then moves in closer to a wooden key holder on the wall, where a hand enters the frame from the right, takes hold of a padlock, and lifts it off its hook.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video reveals the interior of a yurt through a series of camera movements, including moving forward, pedestaling up, and panning right, as it follows a person toward the house. The structure has a distinctive wooden lattice wall and a conical roof with radiating wooden poles, covered by a white fabric liner. The space is furnished with a small kitchenette area featuring a wooden countertop, a white mini-fridge, and a black electric kettle. Other furniture includes a blue armchair holding a brown furry pillow, a blue chest of drawers, and a light-wood chest of drawers decorated with small Christmas-themed figures. A white electric heater is mounted on the wall, and a black and orange backpack rests on the dark floor near a wooden door. As the person approaches the key hanging on the wall, the camera continues to pan right while moving forward, then pans left to center the key in the frame, finishing with a forward movement. A person's light-skinned hand appears, approaching a padlock beside a light blue tag, attempting to remove it from a wooden hook on the wall.**",
