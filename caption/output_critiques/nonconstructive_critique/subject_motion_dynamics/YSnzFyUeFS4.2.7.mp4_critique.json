    "pre_caption": "A group of people walks down a sunlit city sidewalk, moving away from the camera. A woman in a black tank top and denim shorts walks in the center, while a woman in a pink tank top and another in a white sweatshirt walk beside her. Three men enter the frame from the right and walk behind the women. To the left, several other people stand on the sidewalk, with one person holding a bicycle. A white car is parked and stationary on the street.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A group of people walks and stands on a sunlit city sidewalk. In the center, a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a black tank top and light-blue denim shorts, walks away from the camera. To her right, a woman with reddish-blonde hair is wearing a pink tank top, and next to her is another woman in a white sweatshirt. To the left of the woman in the center, two men stand on the left side of the sidewalk. Three men walk into the frame behind the three women. The man walking in the middle is carrying a black bag, wearing a white T-shirt and black pants. The man to his right is dressed all in black. The man walking behind them is wearing a black hat, a yellow T-shirt, and blue floral pants.On the far right and left, the arm and torso of a person with fair skin are partially in view. A white sedan is parked on the street to the left, with a darker car behind it.**",
