The buildings on the left are older with a more classical architectural style, featuring detailed facades and smaller windows. The buildings on the right are modern with large glass windows, reflecting the surrounding cityscape. The street is empty, with no visible vehicles or pedestrians, and the ground appears wet, possibly from recent rain. As the camera continues to move, the perspective shifts slightly, revealing more of the buildings' facades and the street below.",
