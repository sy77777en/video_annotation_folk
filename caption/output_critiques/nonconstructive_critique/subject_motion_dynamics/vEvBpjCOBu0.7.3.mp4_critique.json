    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a wooden paneled wall and a hanging plant, with a piece of furniture partially visible on the right side. A tray starts to fall from above, gradually becoming more visible as it descends. The tray, which has two clear glasses attached to its handles, continues to fall and rotate slightly as it approaches the ground. The tray and glasses hit the ground, with the glasses rolling and settling on the floor. The final frames show the tray and glasses lying on the floor, with one glass partially out of the frame and the other glass settled on its side.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video initially presents a level angle above the ground of a dark, textured floor in front of a brown wooden paneled wall, where a dark green hanging plant and the wooden leg of a piece of furniture are visible. Subsequently, a rectangular tray, which appears to be made of a coppery or dark metallic material and features ornate, dark metallic handles on its shorter sides, falls into the frame from above. Two clear, cylindrical glasses, which are slightly tapered towards their bases, fall along with the tray. After impact, the tray comes to rest on one of its longer edges, while the two glasses roll across the floor. One glass rolls partially out of the frame or becomes obscured, while the other glass rolls and settles on its side, remaining fully visible on the floor.**",
