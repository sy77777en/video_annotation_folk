The corridor has a few wooden benches on the left side and a series of shops on the right, with a blue banner hanging above one of the shops. As the camera moves forward, more of the shops and their signs become visible, including a digital display board and a chair placed outside the shop. The camera continues to move closer to the shop with the blue banner, revealing more details of the shop's entrance and the surrounding area, including a potted plant and additional seating. The camera finally stops in front of the shop, showing the blue banner in detail, the digital display board, and the shop's interior through the glass windows.",
