    "pre_caption": "A man in a purple athletic outfit and helmet is skateboarding in a concrete bowl at a skatepark, with palm trees and a cityscape in the background. As he skates, colorful animated elements, including a sun, flying vehicles, and horses, appear around him, adding vibrant energy to the scene. The camera follows the man as he moves upward and to the left, eventually focusing on a large billboard that reads 'The World is Your Canvas' in bold, colorful letters. The background features a cityscape with illuminated buildings and a sky with blue and pink clouds, enhancing the artistic and dynamic atmosphere of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a vibrant skate park scene transitioning to a colorful billboard. Initially, a man in a purple jacket with a yellow and black striped pattern on its back is seen skating in a bowl. He is positioned to the left, actively maneuvering on his skateboard. Surrounding him are animated elements, including colorful shapes and smoke effects in bright yellow and pink, enhancing the dynamic atmosphere. The scene then shifts to a large billboard displaying the phrase \"The WORLD is your Canvas\" in bold, multicolored lettering. The billboard is mounted on a structure, with additional animated characters and designs surrounding it, including playful creatures and abstract shapes. The transition from the skate park to the billboard highlights a shift from an active, energetic environment to a more artistic and expressive visual display.**",
