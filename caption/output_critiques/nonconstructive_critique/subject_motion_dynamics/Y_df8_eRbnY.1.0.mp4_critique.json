    "pre_caption": "A climber, illuminated by a headlamp in a dark space, holds onto a rock face with both hands. They shift their body to the right, move their right hand to a higher crevice, and pull themselves upward, twisting their torso. They then bring their left hand up to a new hold before reaching higher again with their right hand to continue their ascent. The camera follows their upward progress from a low, unstable angle, shaking and tilting throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person with dark brown hair falling to the shoulder, held in place by the strap of a headlamp, is shown rock climbing in a dark, confined space. They are wearing a dark brown long-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and a headlamp that illuminates the rough, grey rock face directly in front of them. Seen from a low angle, the climber uses both hands to grip crevices in the rock, contorting their body as they navigate the climbing route. The headlamp creates a bright, focused circle of light, leaving the rest of the scene and the climber's features in deep shadow. Around the three-second mark, another man's head with red hair briefly appears in the bottom right corner of the frame, looking towards the climber. Additionally, around the four-second mark, a left arm in a pink-sleeved jacket is momentarily visible in the bottom right corner, gesturing towards the climber.**",

Before the climber moves their right hand, they first move their right leg onto the crevice the right hand was initially honding onto, in order to boost themselves up when they reach with the right hand to a higher crevice. \n2. The video ends right after the left hand gets newly placed, so the climber does not reach higher again with their right hand. \n3.

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A climber, illuminated by a headlamp in a dark space, holds onto a rock face with both hands.

The camera initially captures their progress from a mid-level angle, transitioning smoothly to a higher, more stable perspective.
