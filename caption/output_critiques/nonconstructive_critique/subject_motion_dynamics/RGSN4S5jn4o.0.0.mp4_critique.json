    "pre_caption": "A man in a green jacket and blue jeans walks across a checkered crosswalk on a city street, with a yellow taxi in the background. As he walks, an animated logo appears and transforms the crosswalk into a maze-like pattern. The woman in the background, dressed in a green and yellow outfit, transitions into a pink cartoon character. Another figure, initially a person, transforms into a headless cartoon character with a pink jacket. The background includes a flower stand with colorful flowers and a man in a suit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a city street scene with a checkered crosswalk. A yellow taxi is visible in the distance, driving along the road. On the right, a man with dark skin tone is walking, wearing a green jacket, blue jeans, and carrying a backpack. In the foreground, an animated logo drops onto the ground, transforming the checkered crosswalk into a maze-like pattern. A woman with pink hair transitions into a pink cartoon character through a mixed reality effect. Another figure starts as a person with dark skin tone, wearing a blue hoodie and dark yellow jacket, and transforms into a headless cartoon character with a pink jacket and blue pants. Further back, a man in a suit with a white shirt and red tie stands in front of a flower stand, which is filled with colorful flowers. The scene blends real and mixed reality elements, creating a dynamic visual contrast.**",
