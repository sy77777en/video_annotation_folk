    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, takes place in a dimly lit and narrow indoor hallway. The walls feature patterned wallpaper above dark wood wainscoting and are marked with prominent blood splatters and a red streak. At the end of the corridor, a closed wooden door with a \"no entry\" symbol is illuminated by an overhead light. The perspective, holding a black shotgun, moves forward and then turns to peer down an adjacent, darker hallway where a figure is visible in the distance. A white radiator is positioned against the left wall. Overlays are present, including a heads-up display in the bottom right corner showing ammunition counts and weapon icons. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, reading, \"Price: Get that door open, Sergeant!\" Red splotches occasionally appear on the edges of the view, and a white crosshair is centered on the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "bad_caption": "A third-person aerial drone shot captures a wide, open outdoor plaza at midday, surrounded by modern glass buildings reflecting sunlight. The ground is paved with large, light gray tiles arranged in a geometric pattern, and several circular fountains with clear water are spaced evenly throughout the area. Groups of people are scattered across the plaza, some sitting on metal benches while others walk along tree-lined pathways. In the center, a large bronze sculpture shaped like an abstract spiral stands on a raised platform. Overlays include a transparent map in the top left corner showing the plaza layout, a digital clock in the top right displaying \"12:45 PM,\" and a scrolling news ticker at the bottom with headlines about local events. Occasional gusts of wind cause leaves from the nearby trees to swirl across the tiles. The camera slowly circles the plaza, providing a panoramic view of the scene.",
