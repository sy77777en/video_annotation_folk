A hazy, blueish atmosphere, possibly due to rain or mist, is illuminated by numerous light sources, including beams cutting through the air. In the foreground, a lone, silhouetted figure stands on a wet, reflective surface. Dominating the left side is a large, glowing blue digital billboard displaying an advertisement for \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS,\" featuring a woman in a white bikini and a palm tree. To the right, another, smaller digital billboard initially shows a red and white advertisement with a pig-like character and the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24,\" which then transitions to display a red and white circular logo. The overall environment is dark, with the billboards and city lights providing the primary illumination.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

The spacious hall features polished marble floors and rows of wooden benches, some occupied by travelers with suitcases. Overhead, a massive analog clock with gold trim hangs from the ceiling, displaying the time as 4:15. To the left, a green and yellow kiosk offers fresh flowers, while on the right, a red vending machine stands beside a pillar marked with a blue “Platform 7” sign. Several digital overlays appear in the lower third of the scene, including white subtitles in a sans-serif font and a translucent logo in the upper right corner. The environment is bright and lively, with people moving briskly toward the platforms and the sound of distant train whistles echoing through the hall.",
