    "pre_caption": "The video captures a lush, green forest scene from a drone's perspective, showcasing a vibrant ecosystem filled with tall trees and dense foliage. The setting is outdoors, characterized by a steep, wooded landscape with a waterfall cascading down rocky terrain into a small pool below. The time of day appears to be mid-afternoon, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating dappled patterns on the ground. Notable visual elements include the varying shades of green from the leaves, the rough texture of the tree bark, and the smooth, reflective surface of the water. The scene transitions smoothly, revealing the waterfall and surrounding vegetation, emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of the forest environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "bad_caption": "A first-person view moves through a bustling indoor train station during the early evening, with artificial lighting casting a warm glow over polished tile floors and metal benches. Large digital departure boards with bright yellow text are mounted above the platforms, while commuters in business attire walk briskly past vending machines and ticket kiosks. The scene includes glass storefronts displaying colorful advertisements and a row of potted plants along the main corridor. Occasional overhead announcements are visible as scrolling text overlays at the top of the screen, providing train schedules and platform changes. The camera pans to reveal a staircase leading to an upper mezzanine lined with shops and cafes, with reflections of neon signs visible on the glass railings.",
