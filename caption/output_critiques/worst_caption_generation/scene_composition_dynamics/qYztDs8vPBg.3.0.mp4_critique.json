    "pre_caption": "The video presents an overhead POV shot, capturing a close-up view of a tabletop setting. The environment is indoors, with a focus on two smartphones placed on a flat surface. The time of day is indicated by the phone screens, showing a digital clock display. One phone shows a date and time, while the other displays a world clock with different time zones. The scene includes a pair of hands interacting with a transparent, flexible material, possibly a screen protector, which is being manipulated above one of the phones. The tabletop is cluttered with small items, including a pen and a yellow object, adding to the casual, everyday setting. The lighting is bright, providing clear visibility of the objects and actions within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective.**\"",

  "bad_caption": "A wide-angle first-person view shows an outdoor picnic scene in a grassy park during late afternoon, with sunlight casting long shadows across the area. A wooden picnic table is covered with a red-and-white checkered cloth, and several round ceramic plates with sandwiches and fruit are arranged neatly. A large glass pitcher filled with lemonade sits near the center, surrounded by clear plastic cups. A pair of hands is seen pouring lemonade into a cup, while a blue frisbee and a folded newspaper rest at the edge of the table. In the background, tall trees with dense green foliage line the park, and a paved walking path curves gently behind the table. The scene includes a semi-transparent overlay in the lower right corner displaying the text “Summer Picnic 2023” in bold white letters.",
