    "pre_caption": "The video depicts an indoor setting, likely an office or conference room, with a focus on a man standing in front of a large whiteboard displaying architectural blueprints. The room is well-lit, suggesting daytime. The whiteboard features detailed drawings of building designs, including floor plans and elevations. In the foreground, there are two holographic models of buildings, rendered in a translucent blue material with a smooth texture, adding a modern, technological element to the scene. The man, dressed in a suit, is positioned centrally, facing the whiteboard, suggesting he is analyzing or presenting the designs. The environment is minimalistic, with a focus on the architectural elements. Overlay elements include text and icons at the bottom of the video, providing additional information or context, but they are not part of the physical scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "bad_caption": "The video presents a first-person perspective inside a spacious indoor greenhouse filled with rows of tall, leafy green plants under bright artificial lighting, suggesting daytime. The environment features glass walls and a high ceiling supported by metal beams, with condensation visible on the transparent surfaces. In the center, a large circular table made of polished wood holds several potted cacti of varying sizes, each with distinct ribbed textures and small white labels. A person wearing gardening gloves and a wide-brimmed hat is seen tending to the plants near the table, occasionally misting them with a spray bottle. The floor is covered with light-colored gravel, and a narrow stone path winds between the plant beds. Overlay elements include a semi-transparent weather icon and temperature reading in the top right corner, displaying \"Sunny, 28°C,\" along with a green progress bar at the bottom indicating \"Plant Growth Cycle: 65%.\"",
