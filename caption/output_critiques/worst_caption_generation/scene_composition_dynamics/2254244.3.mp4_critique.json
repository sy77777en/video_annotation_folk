    "pre_caption": "The video presents a drone POV showing an aerial view of a small urban area during the day. The setting features a mix of historic and modern architecture, with prominent buildings including a multi-story structure with arched windows and a dome, and a tall, pointed church steeple. The streets below are lined with trees, and a few vehicles are visible. In the background, rolling hills and a body of water can be seen, suggesting a scenic landscape surrounding the town. The lighting is bright, with the sun casting long shadows, indicating a clear day. The overall scene combines urban and natural elements, providing a comprehensive view of the town's layout and its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the description.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights.  \n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A drone POV showing an aerial view.**\"",

  "bad_caption": "A first-person perspective captures a bustling indoor marketplace at night, illuminated by rows of hanging lanterns casting a warm glow over the scene. The environment is filled with wooden stalls arranged in neat rows, each topped with striped red and white awnings. Shoppers move between the stalls, some carrying woven baskets filled with fresh produce and colorful textiles. In the center, a large circular fountain made of polished marble features intricate carvings of animals, with water gently cascading down its tiers. The floor is paved with patterned tiles in shades of blue and gold, reflecting the lantern light. Overlays in the upper right corner display digital icons for temperature and humidity, while a scrolling text banner at the bottom provides event announcements in bold white letters. The atmosphere is lively, with visible movement as people interact and vendors arrange their goods.",
