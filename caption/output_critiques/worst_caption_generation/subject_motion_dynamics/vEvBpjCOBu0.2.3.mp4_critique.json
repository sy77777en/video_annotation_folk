  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up of a large cruise ship docked at a busy harbor, with passengers walking along the upper deck and waving to people onshore. As the camera pans to the right, several lifeboats are lowered into the water, and crew members can be seen preparing supplies on the dock. The ship’s horn sounds, and the vessel slowly begins to move away from the pier, creating gentle waves in the harbor. The camera continues to follow the ship as it sails past a row of colorful beach umbrellas and small fishing boats anchored nearby, eventually revealing a lighthouse in the distance as the ship heads out to sea.",
