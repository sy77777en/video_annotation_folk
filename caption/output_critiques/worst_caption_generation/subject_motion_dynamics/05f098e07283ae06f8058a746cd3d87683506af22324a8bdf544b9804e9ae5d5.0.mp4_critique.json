    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an aerial view of a dense forest, with tall trees and lush greenery covering the landscape. As the camera moves forward, a waterfall becomes visible in the distance, cascading down a rocky cliff into a small pool below. The waterfall is surrounded by dense foliage, and the water appears to be flowing steadily. The camera continues to move forward, providing a closer view of the waterfall and the pool it feeds into, which is partially obscured by the surrounding trees. The scene remains consistent with the waterfall and pool as the focal points, with the forest providing a serene and natural backdrop.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a bustling city skyline, where several skyscrapers tower above busy streets filled with moving cars and pedestrians. As the camera gradually pans to the right and zooms in, a large suspension bridge comes into view, spanning a wide river with boats passing underneath. The camera continues to glide forward, offering a closer look at the bridge as a commuter train crosses from one side to the other. The scene remains focused on the bridge and the river traffic, with the cityscape providing a dynamic urban backdrop.",
