  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a cyclist riding quickly down a narrow alleyway, passing by a row of red brick apartment buildings. The camera follows the cyclist as they turn sharply to the right, narrowly avoiding a group of pedestrians crossing the path. As the cyclist continues, a delivery truck reverses out of a driveway, causing the cyclist to slow down and swerve to the left. The scene ends with the cyclist stopping at a busy intersection, waiting for the traffic light to change.",
