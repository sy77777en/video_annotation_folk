As the camera pans to the left, a food truck pulls up to the curb and several people line up to order snacks. The camera then zooms in on a man riding a unicycle past a row of potted plants, and finally comes to rest on a group of friends sitting at an outdoor caf√©, chatting and laughing together.",
