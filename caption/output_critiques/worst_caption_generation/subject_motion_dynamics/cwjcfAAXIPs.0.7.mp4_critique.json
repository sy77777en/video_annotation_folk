    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of the camera held by the person, showing the scene in front of them, which includes the foggy quay, the boats, and the distant buildings. The person gradually lowers the camera, revealing more of the foggy quay and the boats as the camera moves downward. The background remains consistent with the foggy atmosphere, the boats, and the distant buildings becoming more visible as the camera continues to lower.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video presents a first-person perspective of two light-skinned hands holding a black digital camera, its rear screen displaying the live view of the scene. The camera is aimed at several traditional wooden boats, predominantly dark brown or red with distinctive yellow accents on their high, curved sterns and bows, moored at a stone-paved quay. These boats, possibly rabelo boats, feature masts and some rigging, with small flags visible. A tall, slender, dark lamppost stands on the left edge of the quay, and further left, a multi-story building with visible windows lines the waterfront. The entire scene is enveloped in thick, grey fog, which heavily obscures the background, although the faint silhouette of a bridge and a distant building on a hill can be discerned through the haze over the calm water.**",

  "bad_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of a cyclist riding quickly along a sunlit forest trail, weaving between tall trees. The cyclist then slows down, dismounts, and leans the bicycle against a wooden fence. After a brief pause, the cyclist walks toward a small stream, kneels down, and splashes water onto their face. The video ends as the cyclist stands up and looks back toward the trail, preparing to continue their ride.",
