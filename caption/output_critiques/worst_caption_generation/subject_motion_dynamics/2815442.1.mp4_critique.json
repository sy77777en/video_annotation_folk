    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide view of a large lake surrounded by forested hills and mountains under a clear blue sky. As the camera moves forward, a boat appears on the left side of the lake and starts moving across the water, creating ripples behind it. The boat continues to move towards the right side of the frame, leaving a trail in the water. The camera keeps moving forward, capturing the boat as it progresses further across the lake. The boat becomes smaller in the distance as the camera continues to move forward, showing more of the lake and the surrounding landscape. The video ends with the boat almost out of sight, and the camera still moving forward, providing a broader view of the lake and the scenic surroundings.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up of a bustling city street filled with pedestrians walking in different directions. As the camera pans upward and to the right, several cyclists weave through the crowd, ringing their bells as they pass. A street performer on the right side of the frame begins juggling brightly colored balls, drawing the attention of nearby onlookers who pause to watch. The camera continues to rise, capturing the cyclists as they turn onto a side street and disappear from view. The pedestrians gradually thin out as the camera keeps moving upward and to the right, eventually revealing the rooftops and skyline of the city. The video concludes with the street performer finishing his act, bowing to the remaining audience as the camera provides a wide view of the urban landscape.",
