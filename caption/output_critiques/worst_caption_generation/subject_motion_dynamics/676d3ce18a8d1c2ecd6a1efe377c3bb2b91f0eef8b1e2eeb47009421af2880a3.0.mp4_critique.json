  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide aerial shot of a bustling city harbor, where several cargo ships move slowly through the water while cranes on the docks lift containers onto trucks. A large suspension bridge stretches across the background, and cars can be seen driving steadily across it. The camera pans to follow a ferry as it departs from the dock, creating ripples in the water. In the foreground, a group of kayakers paddles in formation near the shoreline. The camera continues to track the movement of the ships and vehicles, maintaining a dynamic view of the harborâ€™s activity throughout the video.",
