As the camera ascends, it pans to follow a group of dolphins swimming alongside the boat, occasionally leaping out of the water. The shot continues to rise, providing a sweeping view of the crowded docks, colorful market stalls, and people unloading crates of fresh seafood, all set against a backdrop of lush green hills.",
