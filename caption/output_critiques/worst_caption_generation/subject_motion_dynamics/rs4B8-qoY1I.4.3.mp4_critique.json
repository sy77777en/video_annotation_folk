    "pre_caption": "In a retro-style game with a magenta color scheme, a small pixelated character is seen climbing on a magenta block structure. The character starts at the bottom left of the structure and gradually moves upward, using the blocks to ascend. The character reaches the top of the structure and continues to move to the right, eventually exiting the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a retro-style game with a distinctly atypical visual presentation. The game world is rendered in an isometric perspective using highly pixelated graphics, dominated by a magenta color for its blocky architectural elements, such as walls with arched openings and a central multi-level rectangular structure, all set against a stark black background. A small, magenta, highly simplified pixelated player character is depicted climbing on the magenta structure. The user interface at the bottom features two magenta scroll-like elements on either side. The left scroll displays another small, white, abstract pixelated figure next to the white number \"04\", with a green shoe icon below it. This shoe later disappears and reappears in front of the wall within the game, having changed to a magenta color. In the center, the word \"DAY\" appears in a yellow pixelated font, accompanied by a small yellow pixelated graphic. The right scroll contains a red-outlined rectangular area, within which a white, abstract, curled-up pixelated figure is visible. The overall aesthetic is characterized by its extremely limited color palette and low-resolution, blocky design, giving all subjects an archaic and stylized appearance.**",
