    "pre_caption": "In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a very long, dachshund-like dog walks forward. A large pair of scissors descends from the top of the frame and cuts the dog's body. The front section of the dog then grows hind legs and a tail, becoming a shorter, complete dog that continues to walk forward. The rear section regenerates a head and front legs, becoming another long dog that also moves forward. This process repeats, with the scissors continuously descending to cut the newly formed long dog, creating a line of shorter dogs that all walk in the same direction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a cartoonish, dachshund-like dog with an extremely elongated body and short legs is shown. A large pair of scissors, also drawn in a pencil sketch style, repeatedly descends from the top of the scene to cut the long dog's body. Each time the scissors snip, the front segment of the dog develops two hind legs and a tail, forming a complete dog, while the rear segment regenerates a head and two front legs, creating another complete dog. The rear body appears to extend indefinitely, only to be cut by the scissors again. This cycle repeats, with all the newly formed dogs continuing to move forward in the original direction.**",

  "bad_caption": "In a black and white pencil sketch animation, a group of small birds hops along a winding path. A large hand reaches down from above and gently places hats on each bird’s head. As each bird receives a hat, it begins to flap its wings and rises into the air, joining a growing flock that circles above the path. This sequence repeats, with the hand continuing to add hats to new birds, causing more to take flight and join the swirling group overhead.",
