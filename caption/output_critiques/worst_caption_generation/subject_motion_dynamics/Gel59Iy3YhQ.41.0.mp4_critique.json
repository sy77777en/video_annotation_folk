    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a distant view of a person standing in front of a rocky wall with a sign that reads 'ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK' and another sign for the National Park Service. The person is holding a blue umbrella and reading a book. As the camera zooms in, the person continues to read, and the subtitle 'I will never forget this weekend, Dad' appears at the bottom of the screen. The camera continues to zoom in, focusing more closely on the person and their actions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a young person with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a purple shirt, an orange vest, and dark pants. They stand outdoors in front of a rocky wall and a sign that reads \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK.\" The person holds a blue umbrella over their head with their right hand and reads from a white book held in their left hand. An overlay resembling a camera screen covers the entire video. The video includes a subtitle that reads, \"I will never forget this weekend, Dad.\" The camera quickly zooms in and is unsteady before focusing on the young person as they continue to read.**",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up of a cyclist riding along a paved trail lined with tall pine trees. The cyclist slows down, dismounts, and leans the bicycle against a wooden bench. As the camera pans to the right, the cyclist takes out a map from a backpack and points toward a distant mountain peak. The camera then zooms out, showing several other cyclists passing by in the background as the main subject folds the map and prepares to continue riding.",
