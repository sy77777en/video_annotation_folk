This motion slowly reveals the full extent of the surreal and empty environment.\n\nThe scene is a long, narrow, enclosed space, like a corridor or channel, filled with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, off-white or pale green tiles, creating a sterile and monotonous texture. Rows of bright, square lights are embedded in the ceiling, casting a stark, slightly greenish glow that reflects off the tiled surfaces and the water. At the far end of the corridor, a doorway and what appear to be steps leading out of the water are visible, adding to the liminal and slightly unsettling atmosphere of the location.",

The camera follows their movement as they chase a red ball, which bounces along the grass. One child leaps to catch the ball, then tosses it to another, while others gather around and cheer. In the background, a teacher walks along the edge of the playground, watching the children play.",
