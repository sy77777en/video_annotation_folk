  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up of a sandy beach where several crabs scuttle sideways along the shoreline. As the camera pans upward, a group of dolphins can be seen leaping out of the water in the distance. The camera then zooms out, revealing a long pier stretching into the ocean, with people walking and fishing along its length. The scene concludes as a flock of seagulls flies overhead, moving toward the horizon.",
