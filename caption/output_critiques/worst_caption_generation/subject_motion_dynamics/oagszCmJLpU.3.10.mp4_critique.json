  "bad_caption": "A time-lapse sequence shows a large flock of birds migrating across a bright, sunlit sky. The birds first gather in a dense cluster, then spread out into a long, undulating line as they move steadily from left to right. Occasional flashes of sunlight reflect off their wings, creating brief glimmers of gold and orange. The flock gradually descends toward a wide, open field, where the birds land and begin to forage together.",
