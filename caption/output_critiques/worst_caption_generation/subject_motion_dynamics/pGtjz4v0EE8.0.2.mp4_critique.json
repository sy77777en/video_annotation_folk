In the background, a large suspension bridge comes into view, with vehicles moving across it in both directions. The camera pans to follow the cyclists as they approach the bridge, then tilts downward to show a river flowing rapidly beneath. As the cyclists reach the bridge, they slow down and dismount, gathering at the railing to look out over the water.",
