    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of an underwater environment, featuring large rock formations and glowing flora. The camera moves forward, revealing more of the underwater landscape, including floating particles and a blue light source in the distance. As the camera continues to move, the blue light source becomes more prominent, and the glowing flora and particles remain visible. The camera then shifts slightly, showing a clearer view of the blue object or creature in the foreground. The video concludes with the camera focusing on the blue object or creature, highlighting its distinct spiky features against the backdrop of the underwater environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video presents an underwater scene viewed from a first-person perspective, as if through the eyes of a diver. The surroundings are partially obscured by the diver's mask, enhancing the immersive experience. Large, towering rock formations and pillars are covered in luminescent flora, casting a soft glow in shades of green and blue. Small, glowing creatures or particles float gently through the water, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Initially in the background, a distinct, spiky, blue object or creature gradually approaches the camera as the diver swims forward, eventually exiting the frame from the lower right corner. The overall atmosphere is mysterious and serene, with the interplay of light and shadow creating a captivating visual experience.**",

The camera moves upward, revealing a flock of birds flying overhead and sunlight filtering through the leaves. As the camera continues to rise, a squirrel can be seen leaping from one branch to another, while a deer walks slowly across a clearing below. The camera then pans right, following the movement of the birds as they scatter, and the squirrel disappears behind the foliage.
