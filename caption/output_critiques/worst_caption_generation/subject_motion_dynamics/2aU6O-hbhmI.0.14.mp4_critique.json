The camera starts to tilt upward, gradually revealing more of the cityscape and the construction site below. As the camera continues to move upward, the construction site becomes more prominent, with visible structures and equipment. The camera keeps tilting upward, showing a broader view of the construction site and the surrounding buildings, with the sky transitioning from dusk to night. The video concludes with a wide view of the construction site and the cityscape, with the sun setting in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up of a river where several kayakers paddle downstream, maneuvering around rocks and small rapids. The camera pans to follow the kayakers as they navigate a sharp bend, with one of them briefly stopping to adjust their helmet. As the group continues, the camera tilts upward to reveal a suspension bridge overhead, with pedestrians crossing and pausing to watch the kayakers below. The video ends with the kayakers regrouping near the riverbank, preparing to carry their boats ashore.",
