The floor is dirty and scattered with debris, and the corridor is lined with windows on the right side, allowing some natural light to filter in. As the camera moves forward, more details of the corridor become visible, including broken windows and more graffiti. The camera continues to move forward, revealing more debris and damage along the walls, including peeling paint and additional graffiti. The corridor appears to be in a state of disrepair, with some sections of the floor and walls showing significant wear and tear.

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a group of children running down a brightly lit school hallway, each carrying colorful balloons. As the camera follows them, the children take turns tossing their balloons into the air and chasing after them. Along the left side of the hallway, several teachers stand clapping and encouraging the children as they pass by. The children continue to run and play, occasionally stopping to pick up dropped balloons before resuming their race. Near the end of the hallway, the group gathers in a circle and releases all the balloons at once, watching them float toward the ceiling.",
