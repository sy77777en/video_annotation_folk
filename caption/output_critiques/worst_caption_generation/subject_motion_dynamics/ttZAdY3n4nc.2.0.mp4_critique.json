The trees form a natural archway or tunnel, leading towards a brighter, slightly misty clearing in the distance.\n\nThe camera slowly moves forward along the path, drawing the viewer into the woods. Small, glowing particles, possibly dust motes or a visual effect, float gently through the air, adding to the scene's enchanting quality.",

Furthermore, the white glowing particles mentioned are actually holes in the forest canopy that appear and disappear due to camera movement, rather than effects or magical motes. \n\nDo not say \"which are actually\" in the final caption; just say what they correctly are once. For example \"Small, glowing particles, which are actually holes in the forest canopy, appear and disappear due to camera movement, enhancing the scene's enchanting quality.\" is a bad way to describe it. You should instead say \"holes in the forest canopy appear and disappear due to camera movement, enhancing the scene's enchanting quality\". ",

  "bad_caption": "A group of cyclists rides in single file along a paved road bordered by open fields, their helmets glinting in the sunlight. The camera tracks alongside them, gradually panning upward to reveal a distant mountain range. As the cyclists approach a sharp bend, one rider signals and the group slows down, coasting to a stop near a wooden signpost. In the background, a flock of sheep crosses the road, briefly halting the cyclistsâ€™ progress before they resume their journey.",
