The structure appears to be a historical or military fortress, with multiple levels and walls, and is surrounded by several buildings with red-tiled roofs. The camera slowly rotates around the structure, providing different angles and perspectives of the fortress and its surroundings. The ocean waves crash against the base of the structure, creating white foam. In the background, a few boats can be seen moving on the water, leaving trails behind them.",

People walk in various directions, some stopping to chat while others cross the street at a busy intersection. Several cyclists weave through the crowd, and a group of street performers sets up instruments near a fountain. Cars drive past in the background, and a tram slowly approaches the stop, allowing passengers to board and disembark. Throughout the video, the camera pans across the square, capturing the continuous movement of people and vehicles.",
