    "pre_caption": "Two individuals are kayaking through a narrow canyon with steep, grey, rocky walls. The main subject, wearing a red jacket, black and green life vest, and a helmet with an orange and white 'Teva' logo, is paddling vigorously with a double-bladed paddle. The water is turbulent, and the main subject is seen making steady progress through the narrow passage. The background shows the rocky canyon walls closing in as they move forward. The main subject continues to paddle through the narrow waterway, approaching a more agitated section of whitewater.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two individuals kayaking through a narrow canyon with steep, grey, rocky walls. The main subject, viewed from behind, is wearing a red long-sleeved outer garment, a black and green life vest, and a grey helmet with an orange and white \"Teva\" logo. They are seated in a red kayak, actively paddling with a double-bladed paddle through turbulent water. At the beginning of the video, another individual is visible in the background, positioned ahead of the main subject. This person is also wearing a red long-sleeved outer garment and a helmet while seated in a separate kayak. As the video progresses, this individual drifts forward and eventually moves out of the frame. The main subject continues to navigate the kayak forward, moving through the confined waterway towards a more agitated section of whitewater ahead.**",

Both riders begin by pedaling slowly, with the main subject wearing a blue jacket, yellow backpack, and a helmet with a green stripe. As they reach a steep downhill section, the main subject stands up on the pedals and coasts rapidly. Entering a shaded area, both cyclists dismount and walk their bikes side by side, moving at a relaxed pace as the trail narrows between dense undergrowth.",
