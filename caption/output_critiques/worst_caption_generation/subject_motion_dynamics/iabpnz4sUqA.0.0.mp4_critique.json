As the camera moves upward, the rainbow remains prominent, and the tops of houses and trees become less visible. The camera continues to ascend, revealing more of the landscape, including a road with moving vehicles and a distant town. The rainbow remains the central focus as the camera reaches a higher altitude, showing a broader view of the surrounding area, including fields and more trees.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a flock of flamingos walking along a sandy shoreline, occasionally dipping their beaks into the water. As the camera pans to the right, several flamingos take flight, flapping their wings and gliding above the waves. The camera then tilts upward, following the birds as they soar higher, eventually revealing a large cruise ship passing by in the background. The flamingos continue to fly in a loose formation as the camera ascends, providing a wider view of the coastline and the open sea.",
