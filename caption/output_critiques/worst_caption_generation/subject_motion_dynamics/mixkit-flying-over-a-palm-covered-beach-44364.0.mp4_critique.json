As the camera pans upward, the cyclists turn sharply at an intersection and pass beneath a large suspension bridge. Gradually, a parade of colorful floats enters the frame from the right, moving slowly past the cyclists. The camera continues to track the parade as it heads toward a large fountain in the city square, with the cyclists following behind.",
