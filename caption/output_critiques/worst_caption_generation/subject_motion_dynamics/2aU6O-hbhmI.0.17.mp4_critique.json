The camera moves closer to the building, capturing more details of the structure, including the balconies and windows. As the camera continues to approach, the lighting from the building's lights and the setting sun becomes more prominent. The camera angle shifts slightly, revealing more of the building's side and the surrounding area. Finally, the camera focuses on a specific balcony where two people are standing, visible against the backdrop of the building and the sunset.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a busy train station, where several trains are arriving and departing on parallel tracks. The camera pans along the platform as passengers board and exit the trains, some carrying luggage. As the camera moves closer, it captures a conductor signaling for a train to depart. The camera then shifts to follow a group of cyclists riding alongside the tracks, weaving between waiting passengers. Finally, the camera zooms in on a ticket booth where a long line of people waits to purchase tickets.",
