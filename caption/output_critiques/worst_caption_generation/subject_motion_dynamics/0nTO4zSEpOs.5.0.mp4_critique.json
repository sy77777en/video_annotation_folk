The corridor has a few wooden benches on the left side and a series of shops on the right, with a blue banner hanging above one of the shops. As the camera moves forward, more of the shops and their signs become visible, including a digital display board and a chair placed outside the shop. The camera continues to move closer to the shop with the blue banner, revealing more details of the shop's entrance and the surrounding area, including a potted plant and additional seating. The camera finally stops in front of the shop, showing the blue banner in detail, the digital display board, and the shop's interior through the glass windows.",

Several people are seen browsing the shelves, occasionally pulling out books and flipping through the pages. As the camera pans to the right, a librarian pushes a cart filled with returned books down the aisle. A group of children walks past, each carrying a stack of books toward a reading area at the far end of the hallway. The camera follows the librarian as she stops to reshelve books, then zooms in on a display table featuring new arrivals. The video ends with the children sitting in a circle on the floor, reading quietly together.",
