    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a highway surrounded by trees and a clear sky with a few clouds, as the camera moves forward along the road. As the camera progresses, more vehicles, including trucks and cars, appear on the highway, driving in both directions. The camera continues to move forward, passing through a tunnel illuminated by overhead lights, where a few cars are seen driving ahead. Exiting the tunnel, the camera continues on a road with trees on both sides, and more vehicles are visible. The camera then moves through a more urban area with buildings and streetlights, and continues to follow the road as it curves and straightens. The video shows the camera moving through various types of roads, including those with traffic lights and residential areas, with the sky gradually darkening. The final frames show the camera moving through a tree-lined street and a more densely built area, with the scene becoming increasingly blurred due to the motion.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a train moving slowly along tracks bordered by open fields, as the camera pans alongside the trainâ€™s motion. As the train continues, several cyclists appear, riding parallel to the tracks in the same direction. The camera follows the train as it enters a large open station, where passengers are seen boarding and disembarking. After leaving the station, the train passes through a series of bridges over a river, with boats visible moving beneath. The camera then tracks the train as it travels through a mountainous region, winding along steep cliffs, before finally arriving at a small rural platform where the train comes to a gradual stop and the scene fades out.",
