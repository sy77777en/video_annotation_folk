  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up of a single tree swaying gently in the wind during the daytime. As the camera slowly pans downward, a group of deer emerges from behind the tree and begins to graze on the grass below. The camera continues to descend, capturing the deer as they move together toward a small pond, where they pause to drink. The gradual downward movement of the camera reveals more of the forest floor, including scattered wildflowers and a narrow dirt path winding through the trees.",
