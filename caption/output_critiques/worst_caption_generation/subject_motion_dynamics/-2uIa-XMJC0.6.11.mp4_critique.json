    "pre_caption": "A man is seen on a circular screen, speaking and moving his head slightly. The background shows a blurred cityscape with buildings. The man continues to speak and move his head, and a hand appears from the bottom of the screen, holding a USB drive. The hand plugs the USB drive into the screen's port, and the screen's lights change colors. The man on the screen continues to speak, and a smaller circular frame with a Black man in a red hoodie appears at the bottom right of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a man with short, brown hair, wearing a gray hoodie and a necklace, appearing within a circular frame that resembles a digital interface. A smaller circular frame appears, featuring a Black man in a red hoodie, with a focused expression. The setting suggests a virtual or digital communication scenario, viewed from a first-person perspective as the red hoodie man's hand briefly appears at the bottom of the screen. **\n\nThis caption is only to help you learn the video thoroughly, so don't rely on it too much. Focus on the subject’s motion!! \n",

She pauses to answer a phone call, then stands up and walks out of the frame. A robotic arm enters from the left, places a green notebook on the desk, and then retracts. The screen briefly flickers to show a calendar before returning to the woman, who sits back down and resumes typing. In the lower left corner, a small square frame pops up showing a child drawing with crayons.",
