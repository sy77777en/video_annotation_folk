A tram slowly approaches from the left, stopping to let passengers board. In the background, tall skyscrapers reflect the sunlight, and as the camera pans upward, a flock of pigeons takes off from a nearby rooftop, flying across the skyline. The camera then tilts back down, following a street vendor as they push a cart along the sidewalk, passing by a line of waiting taxis.",
