A prominent rocky hill covered in patches of greenery rises on one side, contrasting with the deep blue of the ocean and the bright sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The focus is on the natural beauty and tranquility of the environment, emphasizing the vastness and peacefulness of the scene rather than any specific object or subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

In the center, a man in a dark business suit and red tie, with light skin and short brown hair, is carrying a black briefcase and looking at his phone while walking briskly. To his left, a woman in a yellow dress and white sneakers, with medium skin tone and long black hair, is holding a coffee cup and talking to another woman in a blue jacket and jeans. Several cars, including a bright green taxi and a white delivery van, are parked along the curb. The overall focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between pedestrians as they navigate the busy street.",
