    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot depicting a dimly lit apartment entryway at night. A dark wooden door stands slightly ajar in the center of the frame, with a bright sliver of light peeking out from the bottom. To the left, a warm glow emanates from a lamp with a white shade resting on a wooden console table, which also holds a few framed photographs. To the right of the door, a low shoe rack sits beneath a large framed piece of art, and the silhouette of a houseplant is visible in the corner. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the quiet, atmospheric environment. The moody, low-key lighting and static composition emphasize the setting itself, creating a sense of stillness and anticipation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a daytime scene showing a spacious kitchen with large windows letting in bright sunlight. In the center, a stainless steel refrigerator stands open, revealing neatly organized shelves of fresh produce. To the left, a woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue apron over a white shirt and jeans, is chopping vegetables on a marble countertop. On the right, a young boy with curly brown hair, dressed in a red t-shirt and khaki shorts, is sitting on a wooden stool, reading a book. Several potted herbs line the windowsill, and a black cat is curled up on a patterned rug near the sink. The focus is on the lively, well-lit environment and the interaction between the woman and the boy, creating a sense of warmth and activity.",
