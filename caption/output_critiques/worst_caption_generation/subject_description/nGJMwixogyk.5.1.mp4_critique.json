Several yellow taxis and a red double-decker bus move along a wide, busy avenue lined with streetlights and billboards. Pedestrians in business attire, including men in dark suits and women in blue dresses, cross the street at a large intersection. The focus is on the dynamic urban environment and the fast-paced movement of people and vehicles, highlighting the energy and modernity of the city rather than any single subject. The overall scene conveys a sense of urban vibrancy and contemporary life.",
