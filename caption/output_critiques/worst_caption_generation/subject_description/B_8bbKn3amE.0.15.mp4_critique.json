    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic landscape scenery shot, flying low and fast across the surface of a vibrant, turquoise glacial lake. In the background, a massive, rugged mountain rises steeply, its lower slopes a mix of brown and purplish rock, while its peaks are crowned with a thick, white glacier under a clear, deep blue sky. Thin waterfalls of meltwater cascade down the rocky face from the glacier's edge, feeding the lake below. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vast, pristine, and powerful alpine environment. The focus is on capturing the majestic scale and raw beauty of the natural scene rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene, with a group of people walking along a wide sidewalk lined with tall palm trees. The main subject is a middle-aged man in a bright yellow jacket and blue jeans, carrying a red backpack and talking on a cellphone as he moves toward the camera. To his left, a woman in a white dress and sunhat pushes a baby stroller, while a young boy in a green shirt rides a skateboard nearby. Several parked bicycles are visible along the curb, and a row of colorful food trucks is stationed on the opposite side of the street. The shot remains focused on the lively urban activity, highlighting the diversity of people and the vibrant atmosphere of the city rather than any single landmark or building.",
