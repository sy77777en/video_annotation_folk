    "pre_caption": "The video presents an indoor recreational scenery shot, depicting a pool area with large, brightly colored waterslides. A prominent red waterslide curves downwards towards a pool of water, partially obscured by a metal railing in the foreground. Behind it, a green waterslide is also visible. The surrounding area features white tiled walls and what appears to be a tiled platform or walkway with a grid pattern. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay of these elements, rather than a specific object, highlighting the atmosphere and design of the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows an outdoor botanical garden scene featuring a large, circular stone fountain at the center, surrounded by a variety of flowering plants and tall palm trees. Several wooden benches are arranged along a gravel pathway that winds through the garden, and a bronze statue of a woman holding a basket of fruit stands near the fountain. The area is enclosed by a low wrought-iron fence, and the focus is on the lush greenery and the arrangement of decorative elements, rather than on any individual person or animal, emphasizing the tranquil and carefully landscaped environment.",
