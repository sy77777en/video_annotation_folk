    "pre_caption": "This video captures a serene landscape scenery shot of a calm lake nestled within a vast canyon of reddish-brown rock formations. The focus is on the grand scale and dramatic atmosphere of the natural environment rather than a specific subject. A white houseboat is moored in a small, quiet cove, its presence serving to emphasize the immense size of the surrounding landscape. The scene is set at either sunrise or sunset, with a dark, cloudy sky overhead contrasting with a bright, warm glow on the horizon, which casts a gentle reflection across the still surface of the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video shows a bustling city street filled with people walking along wide sidewalks lined with tall glass skyscrapers. The main subject is a man in a dark blue business suit and black tie, carrying a brown leather briefcase and talking on a smartphone as he moves quickly past a row of parked yellow taxis. Several women in bright summer dresses and sun hats are gathered near a street vendor selling colorful balloons, while a group of children in school uniforms cross the street at a busy intersection. The scene is set during midday under a clear blue sky, with sunlight reflecting off the buildings and casting sharp shadows on the pavement.",
