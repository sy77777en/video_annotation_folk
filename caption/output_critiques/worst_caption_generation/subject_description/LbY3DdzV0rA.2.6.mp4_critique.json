    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, captured as a time-lapse. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with dark, purplish-gray storm clouds that loom over the scene. In stark contrast, the horizon glows with a fiery orange and red light from a setting sun, illuminating sheets of distant rain falling from the cloud base. A multi-lane highway stretches from the foreground into the vanishing point, with the movement of vehicles captured as continuous streaks of white and red light, indicating the flow of traffic through the expansive, arid terrain. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment, emphasizing the dramatic interplay of the storm, the sunset, and the vast, open landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city park during midday, with the scene centered on a group of children playing soccer on a grassy field. Several adults, dressed in light summer clothing, are seated on nearby benches, watching the game and chatting with each other. A large, leafy oak tree provides shade over part of the field, and a golden retriever can be seen running along the sidelines, occasionally chasing after the ball. In the background, a row of colorful food trucks lines the edge of the park, with people queuing for snacks and drinks. The focus is on the lively atmosphere created by the interaction of the children, adults, and pets, highlighting the sense of community and recreation in the urban green space.",
