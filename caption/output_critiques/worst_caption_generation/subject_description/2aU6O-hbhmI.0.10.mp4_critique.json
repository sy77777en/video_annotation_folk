The focus is on the scale and complexity of the urban landscape, highlighting the intricate network of cranes, buildings, and construction materials. The sweeping angles and vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and the ongoing development, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of movement and progress within the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

Several trees with dense green foliage line the edges of the scene, and a white dog is seen running near the children. The children, dressed in colorful sports uniforms, are actively kicking a bright orange ball, while a woman in a yellow jacket stands nearby watching. The overall composition highlights the recreational activity and the lively atmosphere of the park, with attention on the group of children and their energetic movements.",
