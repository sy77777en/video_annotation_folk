Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

Several adults in white lab coats stand at the edge of the field, observing the game and taking notes on clipboards. In the background, a tall wooden fence separates the field from a row of small red barns, and a flock of sheep grazes near the fence. The sky is clear and blue, and the overall scene centers on the lively activity of the children and the presence of the adults monitoring the event.",
