    "pre_caption": "This is a time-lapse landscape scenery shot capturing the dramatic development of a massive storm over an arid desert. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the weather system itself. A colossal, initially bright white cumulonimbus cloud against a blue sky rapidly expands and darkens, its ominous, gray base spreading to engulf the horizon. Below, a flat, tan-colored desert with sparse, dry vegetation stretches into the distance, becoming progressively shadowed as the storm rolls in, with visible sheets of rain falling in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A group of people in brightly colored raincoats and rubber boots are walking along a narrow forest trail, carrying large backpacks and umbrellas. The group consists of two men and three women, all appearing to be in their thirties, with varying skin tones and hairstyles. One man with a beard and glasses leads the way, holding a map, while a woman with long blonde hair and a red raincoat follows closely behind. The others are chatting and occasionally pointing at the dense green foliage and tall pine trees surrounding the path. The ground is muddy, and puddles reflect the overcast sky above. There are no animals or vehicles present, and the focus remains on the hikers as they make their way deeper into the lush, wet forest.",
