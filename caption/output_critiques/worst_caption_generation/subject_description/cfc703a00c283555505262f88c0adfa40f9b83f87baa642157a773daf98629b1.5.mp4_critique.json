    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a wide, fast-flowing river with white-capped rapids, flanked by rocky riverbanks. On the left bank, a line of green trees and vegetation extends towards distant, hazy mountains. The right bank is a broad expanse of lighter-colored rocks and pebbles, leading up to a steep, tree-covered hill with exposed, lighter-colored patches of earth or rock. The sky above is blue with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the expansive natural environment, the dynamic movement of the water, and the overall atmosphere of the scene, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the landscape rather than a particular object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a cityscape shot featuring a bustling urban intersection with several tall glass office buildings and a large digital billboard displaying advertisements. Numerous pedestrians in business attire, including men in dark suits and women in colorful dresses, are crossing the street in different directions, while a line of yellow taxis waits at a red traffic light. On the right side, a street vendor with a red and white striped cart is selling hot dogs to a small group of people. The sky is overcast with gray clouds, and the overall focus is on the lively atmosphere and movement of the city rather than on any single individual. There is no main subject, as the scene emphasizes the energy and scale of the urban environment.",
