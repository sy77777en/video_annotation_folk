    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured from a fast-moving aerial perspective, flying low along the spine of a steep, golden-brown grassy ridge. To the left, a serene, dark-water lake is nestled at the base of the mountains, while in the distance, a majestic range of jagged, snow-capped peaks rises against a deep blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The video lacks a single main subject, as the sweeping camera motion and wide-angle view are intended to immerse the viewer in the vast scale and breathtaking beauty of the alpine environment itself. The focus is on the grandeur of the natural world rather than any specific object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A group of people in brightly colored hiking gear, including red and blue jackets, are gathered around a large wooden picnic table set on a grassy field. Several medium-sized brown and white dogs are sitting or lying near the group, some looking up attentively. In the center, a man with light skin, short dark hair, and a trimmed beard is pouring drinks from a silver thermos into metal cups, while a woman with long blonde hair tied in a ponytail and wearing a green vest is handing out sandwiches wrapped in paper. The group appears to be enjoying a casual outdoor meal, with relaxed postures and occasional laughter, as a yellow school bus is parked in the background. The focus is on the social interaction and shared activity among the people and their dogs.",
