    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic weather event. A massive, turbulent system of dark grey storm clouds dominates the sky, hanging low over a vast, open plain of green and yellow grasslands. Distinct columns of heavy rain, or rain shafts, can be seen falling from the base of the clouds, connecting the ominous sky to the distant horizon. There is no main subject, as the video's focus is on conveying the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the storm over the expansive natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a cityscape shot featuring a bustling urban intersection. Several tall glass office buildings with reflective windows line the streets, while a steady stream of cars and yellow taxis moves through the crosswalks. Pedestrians in business attire, some carrying briefcases and wearing dark coats, are seen waiting at the corners, and a cyclist in a bright blue helmet rides past a row of parked bicycles. There is no main subject, as the videoâ€™s focus is on capturing the dynamic energy and movement of the city environment during a busy weekday morning.",
