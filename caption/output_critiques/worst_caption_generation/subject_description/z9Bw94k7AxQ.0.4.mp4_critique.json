    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, captured from a low-angle perspective looking straight up from a narrow space between two towering buildings. The structures are rendered in deep, imposing silhouette against a sliver of pale, greenish-blue sky. Intricate, dark metal fire escapes and balconies cling to the sides of the buildings, creating a dense, geometric pattern that enhances the feeling of a claustrophobic urban canyon. There is no main subject; the focus is instead on conveying the overwhelming scale and oppressive atmosphere of the dense city environment, emphasizing the feeling of being dwarfed by the architecture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a group of three elderly women with light skin, each wearing brightly colored floral dresses and wide-brimmed hats, sitting together on a wooden park bench. The women are facing forward, engaged in conversation, with one gesturing animatedly while the others listen. A small white dog with curly fur sits at their feet, looking up attentively. The scene is well-lit, and the women’s relaxed postures and close proximity suggest familiarity and friendship. There are no other people or animals visible, and the focus remains on the interaction among the women and their dog.",
