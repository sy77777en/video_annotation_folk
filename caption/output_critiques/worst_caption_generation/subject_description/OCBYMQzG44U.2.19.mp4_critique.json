    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot of a liminal, pool-like environment. Filmed from a low angle at the surface of dark, murky water, the scene captures a large, sterile room where the walls are covered in small, white, grid-like tiles. Overhead fluorescent lights cast a greenish, institutional glow on the scene, illuminating a dark, circular tunnel opening at the waterline on the far wall and a set of white, tiled stairs ascending out of the water on the right. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the unsettling and expansive atmosphere of the environment. The composition emphasizes the strange, empty space rather than any specific entity within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

At the center, a woman with long black hair, wearing a bright yellow sweater and blue jeans, is reading a newspaper while sipping from a white ceramic mug. To her left, a man in a gray suit and red tie is typing on a laptop, his short brown hair neatly combed. In the background, a barista in a green apron stands behind a counter lined with pastries and a large espresso machine. The walls are decorated with colorful abstract paintings, and potted plants are placed near the windows, adding greenery to the space. The overall composition highlights the lively social atmosphere and the interactions between the café patrons.",
