  "bad_caption": "The video is a close-up wildlife shot featuring a group of deer grazing in a sunlit meadow. Several adult deer with brown fur and white spots are scattered across the grass, some standing while others are lying down. In the center, a young fawn with lighter fur is nuzzling the ground, while a large stag with prominent antlers stands alert nearby. The focus is on the animalsâ€™ natural behavior and interactions, with the soft light highlighting the texture of their coats and the gentle movement of their ears and tails. There are no human subjects or artificial structures visible, and the scene emphasizes the peaceful coexistence of the deer within their natural habitat.",
