The scene includes a shop with large windows warmly lit from within, and a table draped in a red-and-white striped cloth displaying various items outside. The street stretches gently uphill, flanked by utility poles and wires, leading the eye toward a lush, green hillside in the distance under a clear blue sky. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and environment, emphasizing the tranquil urban setting and the harmonious blend of architecture and nature rather than any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

A woman in a bright yellow dress and wide-brimmed hat stands near a blue bicycle, holding a basket filled with oranges. Nearby, a man with dark skin, short curly hair, and a green jacket is arranging sunflowers in tall metal buckets. In the background, a red double-decker bus passes by a row of modern glass storefronts, while a small white dog on a leash sits patiently beside a bench. The overall focus is on the lively activity and interaction among the market visitors.",
