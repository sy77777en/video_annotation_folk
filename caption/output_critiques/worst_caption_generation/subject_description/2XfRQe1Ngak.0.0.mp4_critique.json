    "pre_caption": "The video features a person, viewed from behind, as the main subject. This individual is wearing a red long-sleeved outer garment, a black and green life vest, and a grey helmet adorned with an orange and white \"Teva\" logo. They are seated in a red kayak and are actively paddling with a double-bladed paddle through turbulent water within a narrow canyon defined by steep, grey, rocky walls on either side. The person is navigating the kayak forward, moving through the confined waterway towards a more agitated section of whitewater ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

The main subject, seen from the side, is a man wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt, black cycling shorts, and a white helmet with a blue stripe. He is riding a silver mountain bike and gripping the handlebars as he pedals steadily along the dirt path. Ahead of him, another cyclist is visible, wearing a yellow jacket and a black helmet, also riding a mountain bike. As the video continues, the cyclist in the yellow jacket accelerates and eventually disappears around a bend in the trail. The main subject maintains a steady pace, continuing to ride deeper into the wooded area as sunlight filters through the leaves above.",
