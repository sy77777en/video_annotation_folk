    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A group of children in brightly colored raincoats are playing with a large red and yellow beach ball on a sandy shoreline. The children, who appear to be between six and ten years old, have varying hair colors and styles, and some are wearing rubber boots. One child with curly brown hair and a blue raincoat is reaching out to catch the ball, while another in a green raincoat is laughing and running toward the water. The scene is lively, with the childrenâ€™s movements creating splashes in shallow puddles along the beach. There are no adults or animals present, and the focus remains on the playful interaction among the children.",
