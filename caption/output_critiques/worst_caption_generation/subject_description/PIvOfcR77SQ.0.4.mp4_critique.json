    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil, snowy rural area in winter. The video lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on the expansive, wintry environment and the atmosphere of quiet isolation rather than a specific person or object. A vast, snow-covered field stretches across the foreground under a gray, overcast sky, with snowflakes visibly falling. In the mid-ground, a cluster of white, circular yurts with conical roofs sits near a traditional red wooden house and a few smaller sheds, all blanketed in snow. A dark, dense forest of evergreen trees lines a distant hill, completing the serene and cold winter tableau.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The video does not highlight a single main subject, as the focus is on the lively movement of people and vehicles within the city environment rather than on any particular individual or object. Numerous pedestrians in light summer clothing cross wide, paved streets, while yellow taxis and red double-decker buses navigate the traffic. Tall glass skyscrapers with reflective windows line both sides of the avenue, and green-leaved trees are planted along the sidewalks, contributing to the vibrant and energetic city atmosphere.",
