It captures a tranquil river meandering through a lush, green area with dense foliage and scattered trees. The atmosphere is calm, with soft lighting suggesting early morning or late afternoon. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the peaceful ambiance, rather than any specific object or subject. The presence of animals, such as elephants, adds to the natural setting but does not dominate the scene, allowing the viewer to appreciate the scale and beauty of the landscape.",

Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "bad_caption": "The video is a cityscape shot, focusing on a bustling urban intersection filled with tall glass buildings and busy traffic. It captures a crowded street where several yellow taxis and red double-decker buses move alongside pedestrians in business attire, some carrying briefcases and wearing dark coats. The lighting is bright, suggesting midday, and the emphasis is on the dynamic movement of vehicles and people rather than any single landmark. Occasional glimpses of street vendors selling newspapers and hot dogs add to the lively city atmosphere, but no specific individual or object dominates the scene, allowing the viewer to take in the energy and scale of the metropolitan environment.",
