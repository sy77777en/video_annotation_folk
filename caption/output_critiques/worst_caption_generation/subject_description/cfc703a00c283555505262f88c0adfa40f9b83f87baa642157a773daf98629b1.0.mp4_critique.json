    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a wide, fast-flowing river with dark blue water and white rapids. The river is bordered by expansive, grey, pebbly banks. In the background, a line of lush green trees and vegetation gives way to rolling green hills and distant mountains, all set against a bright blue sky filled with large, fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in this video, as the composition is intended to capture the scale and atmosphere of the natural environment, focusing on the interplay between the powerful river and the serene mountain landscape rather than a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene with several yellow taxis driving along a wide, paved road lined with tall glass office buildings. Pedestrians in business attire, including men in dark suits and women in light-colored dresses, walk briskly along the sidewalks, some carrying briefcases or talking on cell phones. Streetlights and traffic signals are visible at the intersections, and a large digital billboard displays colorful advertisements above a busy crosswalk. The overall focus is on the dynamic movement of people and vehicles in an urban environment, with no single individual or object serving as the main subject.",
