    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast, open highway at dusk or night. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject, instead focusing on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural event, making the environment itself the central focus. Turbulent, dark purple storm clouds dominate the sky, from which sheets of rain descend and brilliant forks of lightning strike the ground, illuminating the entire scene in flashes of pink and white. Below the storm, the horizon glows with a warm orange and pink light, while the headlights of distant cars on the parallel highways create long, glowing light trails that stretch into the heart of the tempest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a group of cyclists riding along a narrow forest trail during a bright, sunny afternoon. The main subject is a man in a neon green jersey and black shorts, wearing a white helmet and sunglasses, leading the group as he pedals uphill. Behind him, two women—one in a blue tank top and the other in a red T-shirt—follow closely, both with long hair tied back and wearing black cycling gloves. The trail is lined with tall, leafy trees casting dappled shadows, and the ground is covered in dry leaves and small rocks. Occasionally, a squirrel darts across the path, and the cyclists navigate around it without slowing down. The scene remains focused on the group as they continue their ride, with no significant changes in subjects or transitions throughout the video.",
