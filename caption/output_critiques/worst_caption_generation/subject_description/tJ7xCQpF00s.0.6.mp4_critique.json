    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a dark, narrow, and wet urban alleyway. The scene is framed by the towering, shadowy walls of adjacent buildings, creating a strong sense of confinement that leads the eye toward a brightly lit opening in the far distance. The ground is slick with rainwater, forming puddles that reflect the dim, cool-toned light, while numerous large dumpsters and trash bins line the path, adding to the gritty, neglected atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the environment itself, emphasizing the moody, cinematic quality and the stark contrast between the dark foreground and the distant light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a wide, sunlit meadow filled with tall, golden grass and scattered wildflowers. The scene is dominated by a large, leafy oak tree at the center, its branches spreading out to provide shade for a wooden picnic table beneath. A small group of people, including a woman in a bright yellow dress and a man wearing a straw hat, are seated at the table, appearing to share a meal. In the background, a clear blue sky stretches above distant rolling hills, and a flock of white birds can be seen flying overhead. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the tranquil, open environment and the leisurely gathering, highlighting the warm, inviting atmosphere and the gentle contrast between the sunlit grass and the shaded areas under the tree.",
