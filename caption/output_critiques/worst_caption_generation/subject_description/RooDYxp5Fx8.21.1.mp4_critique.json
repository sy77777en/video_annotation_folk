    "pre_caption": "This video captures a tranquil streetscape scenery shot in a traditional Japanese town. The focus is on the serene atmosphere and architectural details of the environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of place and calm. The narrow, paved street is empty, flanked by classic Japanese buildings with wooden facades and tiled roofs. In the distance, a lush, green hill rises against a clear blue sky. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a modern storefront for a shop named \"TOHGORO,\" which displays pottery and other goods through its large glass windows. A \"No Bicycle Parking\" sign stands on a utility pole, and a red-and-white striped cloth covers a table on the sidewalk, adding a touch of color to the quiet morning scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street in a modern European metropolis, with the focus on a busy intersection filled with pedestrians and cyclists. Several people in business attire, including a man in a navy suit and a woman in a white blouse and black skirt, cross the street while carrying briefcases. Bright yellow taxis and a red double-decker bus wait at a traffic light, and a large digital billboard displays advertisements for electronics above a glass-fronted caf√©. On the left, a street vendor with a striped awning sells fresh fruit from a wooden cart, while a group of schoolchildren in matching uniforms walk past. The camera pans left, revealing a bronze statue of a historical figure on a stone pedestal near a row of tall, modern office buildings.",
