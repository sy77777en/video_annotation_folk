    "pre_caption": "This is a coastal scenery shot that presents a layered view of the sea from a rocky shoreline. A large, dark rock with patches of yellow lichen dominates the right foreground, creating a natural frame for the scene beyond. The midground features the dark, choppy sea, with several smaller, seaweed-covered rocks breaking the surface. In the distance, a prominent, pale, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon beneath a cloudy, overcast sky. The video lacks a distinct main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural environment. The static composition emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks, the vastness of the water, and the imposing presence of the distant island.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a cityscape shot that presents a bustling urban intersection viewed from a high vantage point. A bright red double-decker bus with large advertising banners dominates the right foreground, providing a vibrant focal point for the scene. The midground features busy streets filled with yellow taxis and pedestrians crossing at multiple crosswalks. In the distance, a tall glass skyscraper with a distinctive spire rises above the skyline under a clear blue sky. The video lacks a distinct main subject; instead, the focus is on the dynamic energy and scale of the metropolitan environment. The static composition emphasizes the movement of vehicles, the density of the crowd, and the architectural prominence of the distant tower.",
