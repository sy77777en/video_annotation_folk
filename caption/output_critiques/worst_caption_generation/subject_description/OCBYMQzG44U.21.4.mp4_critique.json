The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and anticipation as the camera's perspective moves steadily upwards. The wide staircase is enclosed by walls and a ceiling covered in small, white, square tiles with a faint greenish hue, flanked by simple, thin black handrails. An intensely bright, white, and hazy light floods the space from the top of the stairs, obscuring the destination and lending the scene an ethereal, almost otherworldly quality.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a cityscape video focusing on a bustling outdoor market filled with people and colorful vendor stalls. The scene is dominated by a group of women wearing bright yellow dresses and wide-brimmed hats, standing near a large wooden fruit cart overflowing with oranges and bananas. Several men in blue uniforms are seen unloading crates from a red delivery truck parked along the street, while a small brown dog weaves between the shoppers. In the background, a tall clock tower with a green roof rises above the market, and strings of festive lights are draped overhead. The camera pans slowly across the lively crowd, capturing the energetic atmosphere and the variety of goods on display. There are no significant transitions, as the focus remains on the vibrant activity and interactions among the marketâ€™s visitors.",
