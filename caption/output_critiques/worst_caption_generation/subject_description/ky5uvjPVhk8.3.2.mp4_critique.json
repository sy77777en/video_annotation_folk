    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene and picturesque scene of a traditional Japanese garden during what appears to be late afternoon, as indicated by the warm, golden light casting long shadows across the landscape. The focal point is a tranquil pond, surrounded by meticulously arranged rocks and vibrant autumn foliage, including trees with leaves in shades of red, orange, and green. A stone lantern stands near the water's edge, adding to the classical aesthetic. In the background, modern buildings contrast with the natural beauty of the garden, creating a harmonious blend of tradition and contemporary architecture. The sky is partly cloudy, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through, enhancing the reflective surface of the pond and casting a peaceful ambiance over the entire scene. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the environment, capturing the tranquil atmosphere and the interplay of light, color, and reflection that define this beautiful setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a bustling city street during a rainy evening, with several people walking under large, colorful umbrellas. The main subject is a young man in a bright yellow raincoat and blue jeans, holding a red umbrella and looking at his phone as he walks along the sidewalk. To his left, an elderly woman with short gray hair, wearing a green scarf and a long brown coat, carries a shopping bag and glances at passing cars. A small white dog on a leash trots beside her, occasionally stopping to sniff the wet pavement. In the background, neon signs from nearby shops reflect off the slick road, and a row of parked bicycles lines the curb. The overall focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between pedestrians navigating the rainy weather.",
