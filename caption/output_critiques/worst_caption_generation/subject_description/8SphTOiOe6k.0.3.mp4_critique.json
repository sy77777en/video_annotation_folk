    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a quiet street in a small town. The scene features traditional wooden buildings with tiled roofs lining the street, creating a harmonious blend of architecture. A few people walk along the sidewalk, adding a sense of life and movement, while cars occasionally pass by, contributing to the urban atmosphere. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant mountains provide a scenic backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale and environment. The focus is on the overall ambiance and charm of the town rather than any specific object, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of nature and urban life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a bustling outdoor market scene with several food stalls arranged in a row, each covered by bright red and yellow umbrellas. Numerous vendors, including a woman in a green apron and a man wearing a white chefâ€™s hat, are preparing and serving food to a crowd of customers. The customers, a mix of adults and children, are dressed in summer clothing such as shorts and t-shirts, and many are holding plates of food or cold drinks. In the center, a street performer in a blue costume is juggling colorful balls, drawing the attention of a group of children gathered nearby. The market is set on a wide paved plaza, and tall palm trees line the area, providing shade. The focus is on the lively interactions and vibrant atmosphere of the market rather than any single individual or object.",
