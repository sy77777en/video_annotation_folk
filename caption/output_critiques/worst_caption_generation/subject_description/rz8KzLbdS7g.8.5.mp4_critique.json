The focus is on the environment, highlighting the peaceful atmosphere and the charm of suburban life. The scene features well-maintained homes with neatly trimmed gardens, vibrant greenery, and a clear blue sky, creating a serene and inviting ambiance. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the overall setting, allowing viewers to appreciate the harmonious blend of architecture and nature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a bustling city square filled with people and activity. At the center, a group of street performers, including a man in a bright yellow suit and a woman with long red hair wearing a blue dress, entertain a crowd with juggling and acrobatics. Several children, some holding colorful balloons, watch from the front, while adults in business attire stand nearby, some taking photos with their phones. In the background, a row of food trucks with vibrant signage lines the edge of the square, and a large digital billboard displays advertisements above the scene. The overall focus is on the lively interaction between the performers and the diverse audience, capturing the energetic atmosphere of an urban gathering.",
