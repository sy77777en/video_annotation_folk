    "pre_caption": "This video presents a coastal scenery shot, capturing a dramatic view of a turquoise ocean. White, foamy waves crash against large, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack topped with green vegetation. Perched atop a cliff on the right is a small, modern house with dark siding. The entire scene is framed through soft-focus, feathery reeds in the foreground, which adds a sense of depth. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the powerful and serene atmosphere of the natural landscape, emphasizing the scale of the ocean and cliffs rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene, highlighting a group of people waiting at a crosswalk. In the center, a man in a bright yellow raincoat and black boots holds a large red umbrella, while a woman beside him wears a blue business suit and carries a briefcase. Several cars, including a white taxi with a rooftop sign and a green compact car, are stopped at the intersection. A cyclist in a neon vest rides past on the right, and a street vendor with a striped cart sells snacks near the curb. The focus is on the lively urban environment and the interactions among pedestrians, vehicles, and vendors, rather than on any single individual.",
