    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, offering a close, out-of-focus perspective of a moss-covered stone wall in the foreground. Behind the wall, a line of lush green trees is blurred against a bright, overexposed sky. There is no distinct main subject; the shallow depth of field and soft focus emphasize the natural textures and create an atmospheric, almost abstract, impression of a tranquil outdoor environment. The focus is on the overall mood and setting rather than a specific object or figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a group of three children playing with a bright red soccer ball on a sandy beach. The children, two boys and one girl, are dressed in colorful summer clothingâ€”one boy in a yellow t-shirt and blue shorts, the other in a green tank top and white shorts, and the girl in a pink dress with her hair in pigtails. All three have light skin and are barefoot, running and laughing as they kick the ball back and forth. The scene is lively, with the children moving energetically across the sand, and the ocean waves visible in the background. The focus is on their playful interaction and the vibrant colors of their outfits.",
