The focus is on the environment, showcasing a blend of architectural styles with wooden and tiled structures, neatly trimmed greenery, and a clear blue sky. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the atmosphere and scale of the neighborhood, highlighting the peaceful and orderly setting rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The main subject is a man in a bright yellow jacket and black pants, carrying a large red backpack and talking on a cellphone as he moves past a row of parked bicycles. To his left, a woman with long brown hair, wearing a white blouse and blue jeans, is holding a small brown dog on a leash. In the background, a group of teenagers in matching green uniforms are gathered near a food cart, some of them eating snacks. The overall focus is on the lively urban atmosphere, with the various subjects interacting and moving through the crowded area.",
