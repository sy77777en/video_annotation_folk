    "pre_caption": "This video captures a scenery shot of a spacious and verdant zoo or park. The camera pans across a landscape featuring a combination of wooden boardwalks and wide, paved paths that wind through numerous leafy green trees and planters edged with natural stone. The animal enclosures are integrated into the environment with large, artificial rock formations and simple metal fences. The focus remains on the overall environment and its peaceful atmosphere, as the camera's sweeping movement captures the scale and design of the park rather than singling out any of the few visitors strolling through the area as a primary subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video shows a bustling city street filled with several yellow taxis and a group of people waiting at a busy crosswalk. Tall glass skyscrapers line both sides of the road, reflecting sunlight and creating a bright, urban atmosphere. The main subject is a man in a dark business suit and red tie, holding a briefcase and looking at his watch as he stands near the curb. Other pedestrians, including a woman in a blue dress and a child with a red backpack, are gathered nearby, some talking and others checking their phones. The focus remains on the lively street scene and the movement of traffic, with no animals or greenery visible in the area.",
