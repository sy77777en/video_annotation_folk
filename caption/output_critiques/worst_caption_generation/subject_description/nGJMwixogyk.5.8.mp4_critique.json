    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a traditional Japanese street. The scene features narrow, stone-paved pathways flanked by wooden buildings with tiled roofs, showcasing a blend of rustic charm and cultural architecture. Lanterns and signs adorn the structures, adding to the authentic atmosphere. Lush greenery, including bamboo and trees, lines the street, enhancing the serene and picturesque environment. The focus is on the overall ambiance and architectural details, rather than any specific object, highlighting the harmonious blend of nature and traditional design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video is a bustling beach scene featuring a wide stretch of white sand lined with colorful umbrellas and sunbathers. Several people in bright swimsuits are playing volleyball near the shoreline, while others are building sandcastles or relaxing on towels. Palm trees dot the area, providing shade, and a few food carts are visible along the edge of the sand. The ocean is calm with gentle waves, and a group of children can be seen splashing in the shallow water. The focus is on the lively atmosphere and recreational activities, rather than any single individual, highlighting the vibrant energy of a popular seaside destination.",
