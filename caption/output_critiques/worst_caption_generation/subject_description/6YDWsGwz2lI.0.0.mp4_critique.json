    "pre_caption": "This video features a moody cityscape scenery shot from the perspective of a moving elevated train, likely Chicago's \"L\". The camera looks down a street canyon flanked by tall, classic-style buildings under an overcast sky, which casts a greenish, desaturated light over the scene. As the train moves forward, a vertical red neon sign on a building and station signage for \"Washington/Wabash\" and \"Millennium Park\" come into view, while traffic, including a trolley, can be seen on the street below. There is no main subject in this shot; instead, the focus is on the urban environment and atmosphere. The moving perspective is used to immerse the viewer in the scale and feeling of the city, emphasizing the journey through the architectural landscape itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video shows a bustling outdoor market scene centered on a group of street performers. The main subject is a young woman with long blonde hair, wearing a bright yellow dress and playing an acoustic guitar while singing. To her left, a man with dark skin, a shaved head, and a blue jacket juggles colorful balls, drawing the attention of several children gathered nearby. In the background, a vendor with a white apron and a red cap stands behind a wooden cart filled with fresh fruit, handing a green apple to a customer. The performers are surrounded by a crowd of people of various ages and ethnicities, many holding shopping bags and some clapping along to the music. The overall focus is on the lively interaction between the performers and the audience, highlighting the vibrant atmosphere of the market.",
