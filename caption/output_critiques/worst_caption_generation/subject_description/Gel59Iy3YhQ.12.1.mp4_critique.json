    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of a dimly lit, futuristic industrial interior. The room is constructed from gray, metallic panels, with a large, rounded window on the left emitting an ominous red glow. In the background, a bright blue holographic console casts a stark light on a workstation, contrasting with the surrounding gloom. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to establish the environment's tense and mysterious atmosphere. The focus is on the interplay of light and shadow, the functional yet worn state of the room, and the sense of place rather than on any specific character or object. Details like a flashing red light on a wall panel, a fire extinguisher, and scattered debris on the floor contribute to the scene's lived-in, slightly distressed feel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a scenery shot of a brightly lit, spacious botanical greenhouse. The room is constructed from transparent glass panels, with a large, rectangular skylight overhead allowing sunlight to stream in. In the foreground, rows of tall green plants and colorful flowers are arranged in neat beds, while a white marble fountain sits at the center, surrounded by benches. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera’s slow pan is designed to showcase the lush vegetation and tranquil atmosphere. The focus is on the vibrant colors, the pristine and orderly state of the greenhouse, and the sense of calm rather than on any specific person or object. Details like a gently trickling water feature, a hanging basket of orchids, and gardening tools neatly stored along the wall contribute to the scene’s well-maintained, peaceful feel.",
