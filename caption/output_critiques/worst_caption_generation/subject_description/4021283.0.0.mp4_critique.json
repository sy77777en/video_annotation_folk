    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot focusing on expansive rice paddies. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing a patchwork of vibrant green and brown fields, interspersed with water-filled sections reflecting the sky. The scene captures the scale and layout of the paddies, with lines and patterns formed by the fields and irrigation channels. Lush greenery and distant trees frame the paddies, enhancing the sense of vastness and tranquility. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall beauty and harmony of the rural landscape.",

Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a bustling city street filled with tall glass skyscrapers and heavy traffic, with numerous yellow taxis and buses moving along wide asphalt roads. Pedestrians in business attire, including men in dark suits and women in bright dresses, cross busy intersections while carrying briefcases and shopping bags. Large digital billboards display colorful advertisements above storefronts, and street vendors with metal carts sell snacks on the sidewalks. The scene is dominated by the urban environment, with the focus on the energy and movement of city life, rather than on any single individual or landmark.",
