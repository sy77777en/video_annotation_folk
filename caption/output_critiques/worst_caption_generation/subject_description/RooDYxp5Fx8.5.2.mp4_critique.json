    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban street scene. The focus is on the bustling environment, with a wide road lined by modern buildings on one side and a mix of vehicles, including cars, vans, and buses, moving along the street. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, adding to the lively atmosphere. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant green hills provide a natural backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale and openness. The emphasis is on the dynamic interaction between the urban elements and the natural surroundings, rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a tranquil lakeside landscape, with a large body of water reflecting the surrounding dense forest of tall pine trees. A wooden dock extends into the lake, where a woman in a yellow raincoat and rubber boots stands holding a fishing rod, gazing at the water. Several ducks swim nearby, and a small rowboat is tied to the dock. The scene is calm, with mist rising from the water and no other people or vehicles present. The focus is on the peaceful interaction between the woman and the natural environment, emphasizing solitude and stillness rather than urban activity.",
