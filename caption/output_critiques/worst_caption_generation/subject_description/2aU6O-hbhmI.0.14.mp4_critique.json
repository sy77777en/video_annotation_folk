Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a group of people gathered in a lush park, with several children playing near a large fountain at the center. Adults, dressed in casual summer clothing such as shorts and t-shirts, are seated on benches and picnic blankets, some holding colorful balloons and snacks. A woman with long blonde hair and a wide-brimmed hat is walking a small brown dog on a leash, while a man in a green polo shirt and sunglasses is tossing a frisbee to a young boy. The scene is bright and sunny, with tall leafy trees providing shade throughout the area, and the overall focus is on the lively interactions among the park visitors rather than any single individual.",
