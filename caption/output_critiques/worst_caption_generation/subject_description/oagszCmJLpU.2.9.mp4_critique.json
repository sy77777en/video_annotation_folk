    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm system moving across a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by a massive, dark grey storm cloud that looms over the entire scene, with a concentrated downpour visible as a rain shaft in the distance, illuminated by a contrasting pocket of golden light. Below, a vibrant green field of wind-swept grass stretches to the horizon, where a few tiny buildings are dwarfed by the immense scale of the weather formation. There is no main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, emphasizing the atmospheric tension and the sheer scale of the natural spectacle rather than any single object or figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene, with a group of people walking along a busy sidewalk lined with tall glass buildings. The main subject is a man in a bright blue suit and red tie, carrying a briefcase and talking on a cellphone as he moves briskly past a row of parked yellow taxis. Several women in business attire, one wearing a green dress and another in a white blouse and black skirt, walk in the opposite direction, some holding coffee cups. In the background, a street vendor operates a colorful food cart with a striped umbrella, serving snacks to a small crowd. The focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between the various pedestrians, rather than on any single individual.",
