    "pre_caption": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures an expansive view of the ocean surrounding a large, fortress-like structure perched on a rocky outcrop. The focus is on the vastness of the sea and the imposing architecture, emphasizing the interaction between the natural and built environments. The water's deep blue contrasts with the structure's earthy tones, highlighting the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The scene conveys a sense of isolation and grandeur, with the ocean's expanse and the fortress's detailed design as key visual elements.",

Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a bustling city street scene featuring several people walking along a wide sidewalk lined with tall glass buildings. The main subject is a woman in a bright yellow dress and white sneakers, carrying a large red handbag and looking at her phone as she walks. To her left, a man in a dark suit and blue tie is holding a briefcase and talking to another man in a gray jacket. A cyclist wearing a green helmet and black backpack rides past in the bike lane, while a small brown dog on a leash trots beside an elderly woman in a floral blouse. The overall focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between pedestrians, with the modern architecture and busy street adding to the sense of movement and activity.",
