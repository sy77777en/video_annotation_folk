    "pre_caption": "The video is a serene landscape scenery shot capturing a tranquil park setting. It features a reflective body of water bordered by lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage, with trees displaying shades of red, orange, and green. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a warm, golden light over the scene, enhancing the colors and creating a peaceful atmosphere. In the background, a few buildings rise above the treetops, adding an urban contrast to the natural beauty. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the harmony between nature and urban elements rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a bustling city street scene with several people walking along a busy sidewalk. A group of three men in business suits, each carrying a black briefcase, are engaged in conversation as they move past a row of parked yellow taxis. A woman in a bright blue dress and white sneakers stands near a street vendorâ€™s cart, examining a display of colorful fruit. In the background, tall glass skyscrapers reflect the sunlight, and a red double-decker bus drives by, partially obscured by the crowd. The focus is on the lively urban activity and interactions between the various pedestrians, rather than on any single individual.",
