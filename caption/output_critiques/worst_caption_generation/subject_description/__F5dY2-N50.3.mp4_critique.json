There is no main subject because the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and environment of the location. The camera's perspective is meant to immerse the viewer in the setting, highlighting the arrangement of a dark, glass-topped table, black chairs, and grey loungers on a concrete patio that borders a sandy area with tropical plants.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The main subject is a woman with short blonde hair, wearing a bright blue sweater and glasses, who is reading a newspaper while sipping from a white ceramic mug. To her left, a man in a black suit and red tie is typing on a laptop, and a young boy in a yellow jacket is drawing with colored pencils at a nearby table. The café is filled with potted plants on shelves, and a large chalkboard menu is visible on the wall behind the subjects. The overall focus is on the lively social interactions and cozy atmosphere within the café.",
