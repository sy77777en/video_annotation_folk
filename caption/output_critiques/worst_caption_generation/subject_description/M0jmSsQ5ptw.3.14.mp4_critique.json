    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a long, white, cylindrical object suspended horizontally on a thin cable that stretches across a paved area. In the midground to the right, a yellow metal structure, which appears to be a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys, is positioned next to a tall black barrier. The camera then moves upward and to the right, shifting focus to a close-up of a different part of the apparatus. This new view shows a light-colored vertical post, on top of which a thick, gray, flat strap with a silver reflective stripe down its center moves rapidly over a black pulley wheel. A black cable is also visible, attached to the side of the post with a silver carabiner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A large blue rectangular box with rounded edges is positioned upright in the center, supported by four short metal legs. To the left, a man with light skin, short brown hair, and a green jacket stands holding a clipboard, facing the box. A small white dog with black spots sits near his feet, looking up at him. The camera slowly pans right, revealing a woman in a red dress and white sneakers, who is adjusting a row of colorful balloons attached to the top of the box. The camera then zooms in on the woman’s hands as she ties a yellow ribbon around one of the balloons, with the dog now standing on its hind legs beside her. A silver bicycle with a basket is partially visible in the background, leaning against a wooden fence.",
