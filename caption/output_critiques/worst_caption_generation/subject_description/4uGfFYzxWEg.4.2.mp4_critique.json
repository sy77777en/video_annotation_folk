    "pre_caption": "The video displays footage from the quiz show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" playing on an older, dark-cased television set. Initially, the TV screen shows two fair-skinned men on the show's set. The man on the left is balding with short, light-colored hair on the sides and is wearing a light blue and white striped button-down shirt with light-colored trousers. The man on the right has lighter, possibly graying hair and wears a dark turtleneck under a gray suit jacket; he smiles and has his arm around the first man's shoulder. The focus on the TV screen then shifts to the first man, identified as Adrian Pollock, sitting alone and looking towards the camera, followed by a graphic displaying his winnings of £32,000. Later, the TV screen features a woman with long, dark brown hair, fair skin, and wearing a red top. She is shown looking seriously towards the camera next to the show's prize money ladder, which also highlights the £32,000 level. Subsequently, she appears looking down and covering her face with her right hand while a question is displayed on the screen below her. As the video progresses, the camera zooms in, causing the TV screen content to dominate the view, leaving only a small border of the physical television visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a television displaying a quiz show with many characters. It's overall a full shot of the television initially. As the camera continuously zooms in, the frame becomes almost entirely filled with the video on the TV screen, leaving only a small portion of the TV's border visible.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a modern, silver-framed computer monitor displaying a live broadcast of a weather forecast. On the screen, a middle-aged woman with short, curly black hair, medium skin tone, and glasses stands in front of a large digital map. She wears a green blazer over a white blouse and points to a region on the map with a remote in her left hand. Next to her, a young man with dark skin, a neatly trimmed beard, and short hair, dressed in a yellow polo shirt and black slacks, holds a clipboard and nods as she speaks. The focus then shifts to a close-up of the man, who smiles and gestures toward the lower part of the map, where animated weather icons appear. Later, the screen displays a graphic of a seven-day forecast with colorful icons and temperature ranges, while the woman stands to the side, looking at the man. As the video continues, the camera zooms in so that only the digital map and forecast graphics are visible, with the edges of the computer monitor barely framing the scene.",
