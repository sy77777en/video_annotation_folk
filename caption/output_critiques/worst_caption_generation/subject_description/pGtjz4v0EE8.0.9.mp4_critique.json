    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a vibrant waterfront scene. The focus is on the expansive view of a historic city with a prominent bell tower rising above a cluster of ornate, classical buildings. The architecture is characterized by its intricate facades and domed roofs, reflecting a rich cultural heritage. The foreground features a bustling waterway with various boats and water taxis creating dynamic movement across the shimmering blue water. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the grandeur and atmosphere of the cityscape, highlighting the harmonious blend of architecture and natural elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video shows a rural landscape dominated by rolling green hills and wide open fields, with a large herd of brown and white cows grazing near a wooden fence. In the center, a red tractor is parked beside a small barn with a slanted tin roof, while a farmer in blue overalls and a straw hat stands nearby holding a pitchfork. Several chickens wander close to the barn, and a dirt path winds through the scene, leading toward a distant forest. The focus is on the peaceful agricultural setting, with no urban structures or water features present, emphasizing the simplicity and tranquility of country life.",
