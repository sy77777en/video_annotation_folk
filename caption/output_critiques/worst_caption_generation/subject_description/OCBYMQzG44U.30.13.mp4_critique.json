    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a stark, modernistic room. The space is defined by its curved walls, which feature a two-tone design with a dark, textured lower section and a smooth, off-white upper portion that blends into the ceiling where several recessed lights cast a soft, greenish-hued glow. A striking geometric pattern of large white and black tiles dominates the floor, and a narrow, arched doorway is visible in the distance. There is no main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the architectural space itself. The wide, low-angle perspective emphasizes the room's unusual curves, stark contrasts, and enigmatic, empty atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A middle-aged man with light brown skin, short black hair, and a neatly trimmed beard stands near the center of the room, wearing a bright blue suit jacket over a white shirt and black trousers. He is facing slightly to the left, holding a large, open book with a red cover in both hands. To his right, a young woman with long blonde hair, fair skin, and a green dress sits on a wooden bench, looking down at a small, silver laptop on her lap. A tall, leafy potted plant is positioned in the left corner, its broad green leaves partially obscuring a framed landscape painting on the wall behind it. The lighting is warm and yellow-toned, casting soft shadows across the polished wooden floor. No other people or animals are visible, and the overall focus is on the interaction between the man and the woman within this cozy, book-filled interior.",
