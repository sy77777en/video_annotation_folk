    "pre_caption": "This video presents a high-angle, architectural scenery shot of a sprawling, modern industrial or high-security complex, likely a digital rendering. The scene features two massive, parallel buildings with curved, corrugated metal roofs, surrounded by a meticulously planned network of roads and what appear to be multiple security barriers. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to establish the vast scale and sterile, geometric layout of the environment. The focus on the overall design and the monochromatic color palette creates an impersonal and imposing atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video shows a close-up view of a bustling outdoor market, with several people browsing colorful fruit and vegetable stalls. The main subject is a middle-aged woman with short black hair, wearing a bright yellow jacket and blue jeans, who is reaching for a basket of apples. To her left, a young man in a green hoodie and white sneakers is examining a stack of oranges, while a child in a red cap stands nearby holding a balloon. The market tables are covered with checkered cloths, and handwritten signs display prices. The overall scene is lively, with shoppers interacting and vendors arranging produce, creating a vibrant and busy atmosphere.",
