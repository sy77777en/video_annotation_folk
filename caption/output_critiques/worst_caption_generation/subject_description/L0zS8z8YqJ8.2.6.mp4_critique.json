    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot, moving through a series of simply furnished rooms. The camera glides from a storage area, featuring white-framed shelves with wooden surfaces against wood-paneled walls, into an adjoining bedroom. This second room contains a simple wooden bed with white linens and a matching wooden desk and chair. A small window offers a view of green trees against a grassy landscape. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment, showcasing the minimalist and utilitarian design of the wood-paneled interior.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling kitchen scene where two men in chef uniforms, one with dark skin and short curly hair and the other with light skin and a shaved head, prepare food at a stainless steel counter. The man with curly hair is chopping vegetables while the other stirs a large pot on the stove. Several pots, pans, and utensils are visible on the countertops, and a refrigerator with colorful magnets stands in the background. The focus is on the teamwork and activity of the chefs as they work together in the brightly lit kitchen.",
