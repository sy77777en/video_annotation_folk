The focus is on the environment, showcasing traditional houses with sloped roofs and neatly trimmed greenery lining the street. The scene is framed by a clear blue sky, with utility poles and wires adding an urban element. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the peaceful atmosphere and the harmonious blend of architecture and nature, inviting viewers to appreciate the overall ambiance rather than a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a bustling outdoor market scene, with several vendors standing behind colorful stalls filled with fresh fruit and vegetables. In the center, a woman wearing a bright yellow dress and a wide-brimmed hat is handing a basket of apples to a young boy with curly hair and a blue backpack. Shoppers of various ages, some carrying reusable bags, walk between the stalls, examining produce and chatting with the sellers. The market is shaded by large red and white striped umbrellas, and a street musician playing a violin is visible near the edge of the scene, drawing the attention of a small group of children. The overall focus is on the lively interactions and vibrant atmosphere created by the crowd and the abundance of goods on display.",
