    "pre_caption": "The video features an interior scenery shot of a minimalist, tiled room with water. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance created by the lighting and reflections on the water. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene by providing context and mood, or as an FPV shot, creating an immersive experience by drawing the viewer into the tranquil setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The main subject, positioned at the center, is dribbling an orange basketball while facing the camera, and the other two are standing on either side, one preparing to block and the other ready to catch a pass. The floor is made of polished wood, and a basketball hoop with a red rim is visible in the background. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the action and the playersâ€™ focused expressions as they move across the court.",
