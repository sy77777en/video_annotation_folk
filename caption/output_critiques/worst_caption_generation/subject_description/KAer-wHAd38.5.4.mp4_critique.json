    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil rural area in Vietnam. The view from a concrete bridge overlooks a muddy brown river, expansive, vibrant green rice paddies, and distant, lushly forested hills under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The camera pans to reveal that the bridge leads to the entrance of a small village, marked by a traditional red ceremonial gate adorned with colorful flags. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the picturesque and serene atmosphere of the countryside, emphasizing the harmonious relationship between the natural landscape and the small community nestled within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The view from a glass pedestrian overpass looks down onto a wide, multi-lane street filled with yellow taxis, modern high-rise office buildings with reflective windows, and large digital billboards displaying advertisements in Japanese. The camera pans to reveal a busy subway entrance surrounded by crowds of people in business attire, some carrying briefcases and others holding umbrellas. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the dynamic and energetic atmosphere of the city, emphasizing the contrast between the sleek architecture and the constant movement of commuters within the metropolitan environment.",
