    "pre_caption": "This is a high-speed, point-of-view scenery shot from the front of a train, capturing the rapid transition from a dark, covered section of track into a bright, open landscape. The camera looks down a set of wet, reflective tracks that curve into the distance, flanked by lush green hills covered in dense trees. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the dynamic experience of rapid travel and the immersive atmosphere of the journey. The composition uses the rushing scenery and leading lines of the track to emphasize the feeling of speed rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A group of cyclists wearing bright yellow and blue jerseys ride closely together along a wide, sunlit city street lined with tall glass buildings. The camera follows the cyclists from behind as they pedal in unison, their helmets and reflective gear catching the light. Several pedestrians in casual clothing watch from the sidewalks, some holding shopping bags. The scene focuses on the coordinated movement of the cyclists as they navigate gentle turns, with the cityscape providing a modern urban backdrop. There are no vehicles visible on the road, emphasizing the cyclists as the main subjects of the video.",
