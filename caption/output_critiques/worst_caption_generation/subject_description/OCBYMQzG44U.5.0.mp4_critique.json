    "pre_caption": "This is a surreal interior scenery shot of a liminal space, characterized by a long, narrow hallway flooded with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in glossy white tiles, illuminated by a series of stark, square light fixtures that cast a sterile, clinical glow. A simple metal handrail lines a narrow walkway on the right side of the flooded passage, which recedes into the distance where a large, yellow rubber duck with wide eyes floats in an alcove. There is no main subject because the focus is on the disquieting atmosphere and the unsettling scale of the environment itself. The combination of familiar architectural elements with the bizarre flooding and the out-of-place object creates a dreamlike and unnerving mood, making the space, rather than any single element within it, the central point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a modern office interior featuring a spacious, brightly lit corridor with polished wooden floors. The walls are painted a soft blue and adorned with framed abstract artwork at regular intervals. Recessed ceiling lights provide a warm, inviting glow throughout the space. On the left side of the hallway, a row of potted green plants sits atop a low, white shelf, while a glass door at the far end leads to a conference room. There are no people present, and the focus is on the clean, organized design and the calming atmosphere created by the combination of natural elements and contemporary decor. The scene emphasizes the functionality and aesthetic appeal of a professional workspace rather than highlighting any individual subject.",
