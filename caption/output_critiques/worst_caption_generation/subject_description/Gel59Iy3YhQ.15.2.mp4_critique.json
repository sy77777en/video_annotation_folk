    "pre_caption": "This is a somber coastal scenery shot depicting the upper portion of a dilapidated lighthouse against a stormy sky. The tower, made of a pale, weathered material, shows signs of disrepair with boarded-up windows and crumbling sections. It is topped by a dark, caged lantern room. The focus of the scene is on the oppressive atmosphere rather than the structure itself, with heavy rain slanting across the frame and a turbulent, murky green sky creating a bleak and desolate mood. The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A large, modern cruise ship dominates the scene, its white and blue exterior gleaming under a clear, sunny sky. Rows of bright orange lifeboats line the upper decks, and several passengers in colorful summer clothing are visible leaning on the railings, some waving and others taking photos. The shipâ€™s name, written in bold black letters, is clearly visible along the hull. In the foreground, a group of dolphins leaps playfully from calm, turquoise water, while a small sailboat with a striped sail passes nearby. The overall focus is on the lively, cheerful atmosphere created by the bustling activity and vibrant colors throughout the scene.",
