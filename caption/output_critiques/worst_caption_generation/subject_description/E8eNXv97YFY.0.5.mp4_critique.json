    "pre_caption": "This video presents a low-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing a moment of urban development. The composition is dominated by two towering skyscrapers set against a partly cloudy sky. On the right, a completed, modern high-rise with a dark, reflective glass facade rises to a cylindrical crown at its peak. To its left stands another skyscraper in the process of being built; its dark, curved structure is still an exposed frame of concrete and steel, with a prominent construction crane visible at its very top. The upward-looking perspective emphasizes the immense scale of these structures, with the tops of older, lower-rise buildings just visible in the foreground. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the broader environment, creating an atmosphere of architectural contrast and the dynamic nature of a growing city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The central subject is a large, circular fountain surrounded by people sitting on benches and children playing nearby. To the right, a row of colorful food stalls with striped awnings displays fresh produce and baked goods, while several bicycles are parked along the edge of the market. In the background, a group of musicians with brass instruments performs for a small crowd, and a woman in a yellow dress walks her dog past a flower stand. The overall focus is on the lively interactions and diverse activities within the market, highlighting the vibrant community atmosphere.",
