    "pre_caption": "This is a forest scenery shot depicting a network of wooden platforms and rope bridges suspended high among the tall, slender trunks of evergreen trees. The perspective is from one of these platforms, with a heavily blurred, textured tree trunk in the immediate foreground, creating a sense of depth and drawing the eye towards the distant structures weaving through the dense, green canopy. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the immersive atmosphere and impressive scale of the treetop walkway within its natural forest setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The perspective is from ground level, with a shiny red bicycle leaning against a metal railing in the immediate foreground, adding a sense of urban activity and drawing attention to the bustling vendors and customers gathered around the trucks. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on capturing the lively atmosphere and vibrant street food scene within the heart of the city.",
