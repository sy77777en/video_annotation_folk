    "pre_caption": "This is a rural landscape scenery shot, captured through night vision. There is no main subject because the focus is on the eerie atmosphere created by the night vision and the brief illumination of a desolate, unpaved road. The scene is initially very dark, with the silhouette of a prominent, bare, gnarled tree and a line of other trees visible against a grainy, greenish sky. Headlights then briefly illuminate the road, revealing its rough surface, some vegetation and a fence line along its edges, and a small, indistinct structure near the trees, before the light extinguishes, returning the scene to near darkness. The emphasis is on the environment and the unsettling feeling of the isolated, dimly lit location rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A group of three men in brightly colored athletic uniforms are jogging along a paved city street at midday. The man in front has light skin, short dark hair, and wears a blue tracksuit with white stripes, while the two men behind him, one with a shaved head and the other with curly hair, wear matching red and yellow outfits. All three appear focused, with neutral expressions, and are running in the same direction, their arms bent at their sides. On the right side of the scene, a silver sedan is parked next to a row of neatly trimmed bushes, and a tall streetlamp stands nearby. The emphasis is on the coordinated movement of the runners and the urban setting, rather than any particular landmark or building.",
