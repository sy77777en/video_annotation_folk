    "pre_caption": "This architectural scenery shot captures a surreal, flooded interior, creating a liminal and unsettling atmosphere. A long, white hall with a curved ceiling is illuminated by rows of square lights, casting a greenish, hazy glow over the dark, murky water that fills the space. The camera is positioned at water level, emphasizing the ripples and reflections as the view extends towards a raised platform and a tall doorway in the distance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the strange and expansive environment. The scale of the architecture and the mysterious quality of the water are used to evoke a specific mood rather than to draw attention to any single object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling indoor market scene with several people browsing colorful fruit and vegetable stalls. In the center, a middle-aged woman with short black hair, wearing a bright yellow jacket and blue jeans, is examining a basket of apples. To her left, a young man in a red hoodie and white sneakers is reaching for a bunch of bananas, while an elderly man with a gray beard and a green cap stands nearby, holding a reusable shopping bag. The market stalls are made of light wood and display a variety of fresh produce, including oranges, grapes, and leafy greens. Overhead, string lights provide warm illumination, and handwritten signs indicate prices. The camera angle is slightly elevated, capturing the lively interactions and the abundance of goods. There are no animals or vehicles present, and the focus remains on the people and their activities within the market.",
