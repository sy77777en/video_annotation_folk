    "pre_caption": "The video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot, moving forward through a long, dark, and symmetrical hallway. The corridor is lined with numerous identical closed doors on either side, with thin slivers of light seeping from underneath them. The floor is dark and highly reflective, mirroring the stark contrast between the shadowy foreground and the intensely bright, white light emanating from an open doorway at the very end of the hall. The focus is entirely on the environment and the feeling it evokes, using the strong leading lines and dramatic lighting to create a sense of mystery, infinity, or passage. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to draw the viewer's eye through the space itself, making the atmosphere and the journey toward the light the central experience. The stark, monochromatic aesthetic emphasizes form and contrast over specific details, further centering the environmental mood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a bustling city street scene during the daytime, with several people walking along a wide sidewalk lined with tall palm trees. The main subject is a middle-aged man in a bright yellow jacket and blue jeans, carrying a large red backpack and wearing sunglasses, who is walking briskly toward the camera. To his left, a woman in a green dress and white sneakers is pushing a baby stroller, while a young boy in a striped shirt runs ahead of her. Parked bicycles and a row of colorful street vendors selling fruit and flowers are visible along the curb. In the background, a red double-decker bus passes by, and a group of teenagers on skateboards weaves through the crowd. The overall focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the diversity of people and activities present in the scene.",
