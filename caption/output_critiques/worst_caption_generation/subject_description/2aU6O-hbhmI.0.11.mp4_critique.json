The scene includes numerous high-rise buildings, construction cranes, and a vibrant sky transitioning from day to night. The emphasis is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city rather than any specific object, highlighting the dynamic and expansive nature of the urban landscape.",

Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

    "gpt_feedback": "The phrase \"vibrant sky transitioning from day to night\" should be reconsidered, as the time remains constant, and the camera simply pans left to face the sunset directly.

  "bad_caption": "The video features a group of people gathered in a lush park during midday, with several children playing near a large fountain at the center. Adults, dressed in casual summer clothing such as shorts and t-shirts, are seated on benches and picnic blankets, some holding colorful balloons and others eating from open picnic baskets. A brown and white dog runs across the grass, chasing a frisbee thrown by a young boy with curly hair. The scene emphasizes the lively interactions among the park visitors and the vibrant greenery, with no focus on any particular building or urban structure.",
