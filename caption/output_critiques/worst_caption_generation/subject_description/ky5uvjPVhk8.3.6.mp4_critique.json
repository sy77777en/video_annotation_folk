    "pre_caption": "The video captures a serene garden scenery, focusing on the tranquil environment and lush greenery. A gentle stream flows over small stone steps, creating a soothing cascade, while vibrant autumn foliage in shades of red and green frames the scene. The stone and wooden structures blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, enhancing the peaceful atmosphere. The focus is on the overall ambiance and the harmonious blend of natural and architectural elements, rather than any specific object, highlighting the beauty and tranquility of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

Several cars, including a bright yellow taxi and a red convertible, are stopped at a traffic light. A man in a blue business suit and a woman in a white dress stand near the curb, both holding shopping bags. Tall glass buildings line the street, reflecting sunlight, while a street vendor with a striped umbrella sells snacks nearby. The focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between pedestrians and vehicles, highlighting the energy and movement of the city environment.",
