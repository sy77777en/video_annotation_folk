    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm developing over a desert at dusk. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment. The sky is filled with a massive, churning storm cloud, its dark purple and grey masses brilliantly illuminated from within by flashes of lightning, creating spectacular bursts of white and pink light. Below the turbulent cloud cover, sheets of rain fall over a distant mountain range, which is silhouetted against the warm, orange glow of the setting sun on the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The main subject is a group of people waiting at a crosswalk, including a man in a blue business suit holding a briefcase, a woman in a yellow dress with long brown hair, and a child wearing a red backpack. Several cars, including a white taxi and a green bus, are stopped at the traffic light. Tall glass office buildings line both sides of the street, reflecting sunlight. The overall focus is on the busy atmosphere and movement of pedestrians and vehicles in the city center.",
