    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot of a serene winter forest. The focus is on the environment, highlighting the tranquil atmosphere and the beauty of nature. Snow blankets the ground and clings to the branches of tall, leafless trees, creating a uniform white landscape. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft, dappled shadows and adding a warm glow to the otherwise cool scene. The absence of a specific subject emphasizes the vastness and peacefulness of the forest, inviting viewers to appreciate the overall ambiance and scale of the natural setting.",

Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a bustling city street scene with several people walking along a busy sidewalk. The main subject is a middle-aged man with dark skin, wearing a bright yellow jacket and blue jeans, carrying a large black backpack over one shoulder as he moves past storefronts. To his right, a woman with long blonde hair, dressed in a red dress and white sneakers, is holding a cup of coffee and talking on her phone. Several cars, including a red sports car and a white van, are parked along the curb, while a cyclist in a green helmet rides past in the background. The overall focus is on the lively urban environment and the interactions between pedestrians and vehicles, with the cityâ€™s tall glass buildings reflecting the afternoon sunlight.",
