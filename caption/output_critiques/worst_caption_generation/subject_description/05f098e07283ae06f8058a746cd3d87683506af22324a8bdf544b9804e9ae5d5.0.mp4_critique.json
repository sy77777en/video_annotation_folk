The main subject is a man in a dark business suit and blue tie, carrying a briefcase and talking on a smartphone as he moves briskly past a row of parked yellow taxis. A woman in a bright red dress and white sneakers stands nearby, holding a coffee cup and looking at a digital map on her tablet. In the background, a street vendor operates a small cart selling hot dogs, while a cyclist wearing a green helmet rides past.
