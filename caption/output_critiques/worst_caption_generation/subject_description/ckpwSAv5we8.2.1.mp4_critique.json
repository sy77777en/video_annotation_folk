    "pre_caption": "The video presents a landscape scenery shot, capturing a dramatic time-lapse of the night sky over a rugged, rocky terrain. Initially, wispy clouds streak across a dusky blue sky, gradually clearing to reveal a breathtaking celestial display. As darkness deepens, the starfield becomes incredibly dense, with the luminous band of the Milky Way galaxy emerging in stunning detail against the inky blackness. Framing the lower portion of the view are the silhouettes of two large rock formations, their reddish-brown surfaces catching the faint ambient light. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vastness of the environment and the atmospheric transition, emphasizing the grand scale of the cosmos against the static, earthly landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a bustling city street scene at midday, with a steady stream of pedestrians crossing a wide intersection. The main subject is a woman in a bright yellow raincoat and black boots, holding a large blue umbrella as she walks briskly toward the camera. To her left, a man in a gray suit and red tie is talking on a cellphone, while a cyclist wearing a green helmet and backpack weaves through the crowd. Several yellow taxis are lined up along the curb, and a street vendor with a striped cart is selling hot dogs nearby. The focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between the various city dwellers as they navigate the busy crosswalk.",
