The scene features a gently sloping road flanked by lush green trees and modest residential buildings, with wet pavement reflecting the overcast sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding to the urban atmosphere. The focus is on the serene environment and the interplay of rain and greenery, rather than any specific object, creating a tranquil and atmospheric mood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

Numerous shoppers, including a woman in a yellow dress carrying a woven basket and a man in a blue jacket examining apples, move between the stalls. Wooden crates filled with oranges, bananas, and leafy greens are stacked along the walkway, while a small brown dog sits near a vendorâ€™s table. The focus is on the lively interactions and vibrant produce displays, with the market atmosphere emphasized by the crowd and variety of goods.",
