    "pre_caption": "This video presents a streetscape scenery shot from a quiet Japanese town on a damp, overcast day. The shot lacks a central subject, instead focusing on the tranquil, rain-slicked atmosphere of the neighborhood. The stationary camera perspective invites the viewer to observe the environment's details, from the architecture to the flow of daily life. In the foreground, a brick-lined traffic island with a leafy tree and yellow flowers sits beside a patch of red-painted pavement. Cars, including a white kei car and a red hatchback, navigate the curving, wet asphalt. Across the street, a modern white building with \"EXTERIOR GARDEN\" signage and a small palm tree contrasts with more traditional residential houses, all under a web of overhead power lines against a cloudy sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A group of three cyclists wearing bright yellow rain jackets and black helmets ride side by side along a dry, sunlit boulevard in a bustling European city. The cyclists, two men and one woman, all appear to be in their thirties, with light skin and short hair, and are focused ahead as they pedal past a row of parked blue scooters. On the left, a large stone fountain with a bronze statue of a lion is surrounded by blooming tulips and benches occupied by people reading newspapers. In the background, a glass-walled café with outdoor seating is filled with patrons, while a double-decker red bus passes by a row of tall, leafy oak trees. The scene is lively and energetic, with the cyclists moving toward the left side of the frame as pedestrians cross the street at a busy intersection.",
