    "pre_caption": "The video is a rural landscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet, sunlit country road that gently curves through a verdant area under a vast, partly cloudy sky. The scene features lush greenery along the roadside, a few scattered houses with red roofs, and a tranquil atmosphere enhanced by the expansive blue sky filled with billowing white clouds. The focus is on the environment and the sense of open space, emphasizing the peacefulness and scale of the rural setting rather than highlighting any specific object or individual, which is why there is no main subject in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

Pedestrians in business attire, some carrying briefcases, cross the street in groups, while a street vendor with a striped umbrella sells snacks on the corner. The focus is on the dynamic urban environment and the interactions between people and vehicles, highlighting the energy and movement of a busy downtown area rather than any single individual or object.",
