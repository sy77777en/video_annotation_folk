    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot of Venice, Italy, captured during a golden sunset. The camera glides down the Grand Canal, moving towards the iconic, white stone Rialto Bridge with its distinct arches. The city's dense architecture, characterized by buildings with red-tiled roofs, is bathed in the warm, low-angled light of the setting sun. On the dark green water of the canal, several long, white water buses (vaporettos) are docked or moving, alongside smaller motorboats and gondolas. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is instead on conveying the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the entire urban landscape, emphasizing the unique interplay of historic architecture, water, and light that defines the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a panoramic aerial view of a sprawling desert landscape, captured under the bright midday sun. The camera soars above a wide, sandy expanse dotted with tall, green cacti and scattered boulders, moving toward a large, modern glass pyramid structure at the center. The area is bordered by a winding, blue river where several yellow kayaks and paddleboards are visible, along with a few people in colorful swimsuits relaxing on the shore. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is instead on showcasing the vastness and unique features of the arid environment, highlighting the contrast between the geometric architecture, natural desert elements, and the vibrant activity along the waterâ€™s edge.",
