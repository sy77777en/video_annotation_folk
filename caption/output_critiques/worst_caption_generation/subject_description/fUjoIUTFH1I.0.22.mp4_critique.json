    "pre_caption": "This video presents a moody cityscape scenery shot of a street in New Orleans on an overcast day. The perspective is from a wide, wet stone sidewalk bordered on the left by a tall, black wrought-iron fence and lush trees, including a palm tree. On the right, the street is lined with parked vehicles, most notably a large white Penske rental truck, and features a row of classic, colorful buildings with ornate balconies. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the overall environment to capture the city's distinct atmosphere and architectural charm. The few pedestrians walking along the sidewalk serve only to add a sense of scale and life to the scene rather than acting as a focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling outdoor market scene in Tokyo on a sunny afternoon. The perspective is from a narrow, busy street lined with red paper lanterns and wooden stalls selling fresh seafood and colorful produce. On the left, a group of elderly women in traditional kimonos are seated on low benches, chatting and sipping tea. On the right, a row of bicycles is parked beside a small, blue delivery van, and several young men in white aprons are grilling skewers over open flames. The main focus is on the vibrant activity and interactions among the vendors and shoppers, with the lively crowd and decorative banners creating a festive atmosphere. There are no prominent architectural features, as the emphasis is on the people and the dynamic market environment.",
