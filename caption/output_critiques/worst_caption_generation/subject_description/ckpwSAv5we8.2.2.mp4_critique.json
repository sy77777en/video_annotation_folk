    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast desert under a bright, hazy sun. The scene is dominated by massive, rolling sand dunes that create a series of smooth, undulating lines across the horizon against a pale blue sky. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and stark, windswept atmosphere of the desert environment. A few distant palm trees are visible, but they serve only to emphasize the vastness of the landscape rather than acting as a focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a cityscape shot featuring a bustling urban plaza filled with people walking and gathering near a large, modern glass fountain. The scene is dominated by tall skyscrapers with reflective windows, casting long shadows across the paved square. Several street vendors with colorful umbrellas are visible, selling food and drinks to passersby. The focus is on the lively atmosphere and the interaction between the diverse crowd and the contemporary architecture, with no single individual serving as the main subject. A few bicycles are parked along the edge of the plaza, adding to the sense of everyday city life.",
