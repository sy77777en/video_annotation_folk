    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a wide, gently flowing river bordered by rocky banks and lush green vegetation, with distant hills and mountains rising under a clear blue sky dotted with large, billowing white clouds. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the river and its surroundings rather than highlighting any specific object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the atmosphere and beauty of the landscape as a whole, inviting viewers to appreciate the serene and unspoiled character of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

Several cars, including a bright yellow taxi and a red convertible, are parked along the curb. In the center, a woman in a blue business suit with short black hair and light skin is walking briskly while holding a briefcase. To her left, a man wearing a green jacket, jeans, and a baseball cap is riding a bicycle. Street vendors with colorful umbrellas line the sidewalk, displaying various goods on tables. The scene is lively, with people interacting and vehicles passing by, capturing the energy and diversity of urban life.",
