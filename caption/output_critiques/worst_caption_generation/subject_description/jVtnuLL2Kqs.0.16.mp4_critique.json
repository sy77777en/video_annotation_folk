    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot focused on a grand, classical-style building. There is no main subject, as the camera's sweeping motion is intended to capture the impressive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment rather than a specific person or object. The shot begins low to the ground, emphasizing the massive, round stone base of a large column before pulling back to reveal a wide set of stone steps leading up to the building's curved facade. The structure features light-colored stone block walls and a window with a grid pattern, while in the background, a street with other buildings and a black car can be seen under an overcast sky, with wet pavement reflecting the muted light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a tranquil park scene centered on a large bronze statue of a horse rearing up on its hind legs. The camera is positioned slightly above ground level, highlighting the lush green grass and a winding gravel path that curves around the statue. Several tall, leafy trees with dense canopies frame the area, and a wooden bench sits nearby with a man in a blue jacket and gray hat reading a newspaper. In the distance, a small pond with ducks swimming can be seen, and the sky is clear and bright, casting strong sunlight and sharp shadows across the landscape. There are no vehicles or buildings visible, and the focus remains on the peaceful natural setting and the striking equestrian statue.",
