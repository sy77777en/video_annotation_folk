    "pre_caption": "The video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, initially flying low along a sunlit canal in Venice, flanked by colorful, historic buildings with terracotta roofs. The camera then ascends, revealing a broader panorama of the densely packed city, showcasing more canals, diverse architecture, and the expanse of rooftops under a clear blue sky. There is no single main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall environment, atmosphere, and architectural scale of Venice, emphasizing the unique urban landscape formed by its waterways and historic structures rather than singling out a specific element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a bustling mountain village scene, beginning with a close-up of a group of sheep grazing on a grassy hillside dotted with wildflowers. The camera gradually pulls back to reveal several wooden cabins with snow-covered roofs, nestled among tall pine trees. As the view widens, a narrow dirt road becomes visible, winding through the village and leading to a small stone bridge over a rushing stream. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the tranquil rural environment, the natural landscape, and the traditional alpine architecture, rather than highlighting any particular animal or building.",
