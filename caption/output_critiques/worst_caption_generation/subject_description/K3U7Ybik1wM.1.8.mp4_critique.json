    "pre_caption": "This video presents a countryside scenery shot, focusing on the atmosphere of a quiet, rural setting rather than a specific subject. The view begins from a wet, flagstone patio, looking out over a vibrant green lawn towards a wooden-fenced pasture where two brown horses graze among yellow wildflowers under a cloudy sky. The camera then gently tilts down, shifting the focus from the pastoral landscape to the detailed, irregular pattern of the damp, weathered stones of the patio itself. The absence of a main subject allows the viewer to absorb the tranquil environment and the textures of the natural and man-made elements within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene, centering on a group of people waiting at a crosswalk. The main subject is a middle-aged man with light skin, short black hair, and glasses, wearing a blue business suit and holding a black briefcase in his right hand. To his left stands a young woman with long blonde hair, dressed in a red jacket and jeans, looking down at her smartphone. Several cars, including a yellow taxi and a white van, are stopped at the intersection, while a cyclist in a green helmet rides past in the bike lane. The camera briefly pans upward, revealing tall glass office buildings reflecting the sunlight, before returning to the street level where the traffic light changes and the group begins to cross. The focus on the busy urban environment and the interactions among the pedestrians highlights the energy and movement of the city.",
