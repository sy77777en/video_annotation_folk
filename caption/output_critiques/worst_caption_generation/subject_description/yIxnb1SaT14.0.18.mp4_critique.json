    "pre_caption": "This video presents a vibrant, time-lapse cityscape scenery shot of a bustling Parisian street at night. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject; the time-lapse photography intentionally blurs the pedestrians into streams of motion, emphasizing the dynamic energy of the city itself. The scene is illuminated by the warm, golden glow of ornate buildings, one of which is covered in a dense web of white fairy lights, and the bright lights of a cafe with a prominent red awning. A classic Art Nouveau \"METROPOLITAIN\" metro entrance stands centrally, its green ironwork and glowing sign a key feature. The wet pavement reflects the myriad of colorful lights, creating a glossy, dreamlike quality that enhances the romantic and lively ambiance of the location.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a tranquil, daytime park scene centered on a large, open grassy field with a single, mature oak tree providing shade near the middle. A group of children in bright yellow uniforms are playing soccer, with one child in a blue cap kicking a red ball toward a portable white goal. To the right, a woman in a long green dress and sunhat sits on a wooden bench reading a newspaper, while a brown and white dog lies at her feet. In the background, a row of bicycles is parked along a low stone wall, and a small pond with ducks swimming is visible beyond the field. The overall focus is on the leisurely activities and relaxed atmosphere of the park, with clear blue skies and sunlight casting soft shadows across the scene.",
