    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of the Colosseum's interior, with the focus on the architectural scenery rather than any specific subject. From a high-angle perspective, the camera captures the vast ruins, with the exposed, vegetation-dotted hypogeum in the foreground and lower half of the frame. A modern wooden platform extends from the left middle ground toward the center, while the multi-tiered, arched walls of the amphitheater curve around the middle ground and background, with the sky visible at the top. The camera executes a slow pan to the right and a subtle zoom-in, following the structure's elliptical shape. This movement shifts the composition, bringing more of the right side of the interior into view and repositioning the wooden platform more centrally within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot, offering a sweeping view of the interior of the Colosseum in Rome. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and historical grandeur of the ancient amphitheater. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc inside the vast, ruined structure, revealing its elliptical shape and multiple tiers of arched corridors. Much of the original arena floor is missing, exposing the intricate network of subterranean tunnels and chambers of the hypogeum below, now overgrown with patches of green grass. Tourists, appearing small in comparison to the massive stone walls, can be seen walking along the remaining pathways and gathered on a modern wooden platform that extends over a portion of the exposed lower level. The overcast sky casts a soft, even light over the weathered brown and grey stone, enhancing the monument's ancient and timeworn atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An expansive view from within the Colosseum in Rome reveals the ancient amphitheater's ruined interior under an overcast sky. The weathered, tan-colored stone structure features multiple tiers of arched openings and seating areas, with the upper walls showing rectangular windows against the gray sky. A modern, light-colored wooden platform reconstructs a section of the arena floor, standing over the exposed hypogeum—a complex network of stone-lined underground chambers where green vegetation grows. Numerous small figures of tourists can be seen walking on the platform and along the upper-level walkways. The soft, diffused daylight filtering through the clouds gradually shifts the scene's tone from warm to cool as the video progresses.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The statue stands on a raised pedestal, with its head nearly level with the camera, which is placed slightly below eye level. To the left and right in the middle ground, two large fountains are visible, each spraying water upward, creating a symmetrical effect. In the background, a row of tall pine trees lines the upper edge of the frame, with no sky visible. The camera slowly tilts upward, shifting the statue’s head from the lower center to the upper center of the frame, while the fountains remain stationary. The shot maintains a consistent distance from the statue, and the camera’s height remains just below the subject throughout the movement.",
