    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle perspective. Initially, the red lattice arm of a large construction crane is positioned in the foreground, extending from the right side of the frame diagonally toward the top left. A second crane is visible in the middle ground on the left, with a dense cityscape of skyscrapers filling the bottom and center of the frame. The camera moves forward, causing the foreground crane's arm to sweep across the top of the frame, revealing more of the urban environment below and altering the composition of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot from a high, sweeping perspective during a vibrant sunset. The camera moves alongside the immense, red lattice structure of a construction crane, which frames the view of a sprawling urban center below. Another crane is visible in the distance, silhouetted against a sky painted with brilliant orange, yellow, and pink clouds that transition to a cool teal color higher up. The scene is filled with a dense collection of modern skyscrapers and buildings, their lights beginning to twinkle as evening approaches. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the urban environment, using the prominent cranes to emphasize the theme of a city in a state of constant growth and development.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-altitude perspective of a dense cityscape during a colorful sunset. The sky transitions from orange and yellow at the horizon to a pale turquoise, with scattered clouds. The camera moves forward, flying close to the long, red lattice arm of a large construction crane in the foreground. A second red crane stands in the distance against the vibrant sky. Below, the urban environment is filled with numerous modern high-rise buildings and skyscrapers, with some lights visible in the windows.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

At the start, a person wearing a blue jacket stands in the center foreground, facing the camera, with a bicycle positioned to their left in the middle ground. Behind them, a row of small trees lines the bottom right of the frame, while a fountain occupies the background, stretching across the top of the image. The camera slowly pans to the left, causing the person and bicycle to move toward the right edge of the frame, while the trees and fountain remain visible but shift further into the background. The camera maintains its height above the subjects throughout the movement.",
