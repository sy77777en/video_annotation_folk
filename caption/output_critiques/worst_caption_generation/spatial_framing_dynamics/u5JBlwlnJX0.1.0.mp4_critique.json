    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman with a staff stands in the middle ground, left of center, on a grassy hill. Positioned slightly closer to the camera, a cloaked figure stands in the center of the frame. A low stone wall runs across the foreground from the left, while a large rock formation occupies the foreground on the right. The sea fills the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned above the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with dark hair pulled back stands on a grassy hill, carrying a long, dark staff on her back. She wears a light-colored, sleeveless top, dark pants, and has a bag slung over her shoulder. In front of her and on slightly lower ground, another person stands with their back to the viewer, wearing a long, hooded, light brown cloak that conceals their form. The two figures appear to be facing each other on a cliffside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a wide shot of a rugged, coastal landscape under an overcast sky. A green, grassy hill slopes down towards a vast, grey-blue sea. A low wall constructed from dark, stacked stones runs along the hillside. Large, weathered rock formations, some marked with yellow lichen, are scattered across the terrain, particularly on the right side of the scene. Two figures stand on the hill against the backdrop of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

In the background, tall city buildings fill the upper left portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level with the seated man.",
