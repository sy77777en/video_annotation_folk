    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a serene garden scene. In the first frame, the stream flows from the top center to the bottom center, with stone steps in the foreground and vibrant autumn foliage framing the scene on the left and right. The wooden and stone structures are positioned on the right side, extending from the middle ground to the background. The camera is at the subject's height, capturing the scene from a slightly elevated perspective. In the second frame, the path curves from the bottom center to the top left, bordered by greenery on both sides. Signs are positioned in the middle ground, and a person is visible on the path in the background, moving from the center to the right. The camera maintains a consistent height, providing a continuous view of the garden's tranquil setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene garden scenery, focusing on the tranquil environment and lush greenery. A gentle stream flows over small stone steps, creating a soothing cascade, while vibrant autumn foliage in shades of red and green frames the scene. The stone and wooden structures blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, enhancing the peaceful atmosphere. The focus is on the overall ambiance and the harmonious blend of natural and architectural elements, rather than any specific object, highlighting the beauty and tranquility of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a serene outdoor setting viewed from a first-person perspective, as if through the character’s eyes. It captures a tranquil garden scene with a small stream cascading over stone steps, surrounded by lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage in shades of red and orange. The setting appears to be a traditional Japanese garden, with a wooden building featuring stone walls on one side. The path is well-maintained, bordered by neatly trimmed grass and small flowering plants. The time of day is likely late afternoon, as the lighting is soft and natural. The environment is peaceful, with the gentle sound of water enhancing the calm atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

Tall glass office buildings rise in the background, filling the top half of the frame. The camera is positioned at ground level, looking slightly upward toward the buildings. As the camera pans to the left, a group of street performers enters from the right foreground, moving toward the center. Food carts line the bottom right, and a digital billboard is visible in the top left background. The camera maintains a low angle throughout, emphasizing the height of the surrounding structures and the activity on the street.",
