    "pre_caption": "This static, extreme wide shot presents a high-angle aerial view of the scenery. The turquoise water of a canal fills the foreground and the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, several small motorboats travel across the water. The city of Venice occupies the middle ground, stretching horizontally across the frame, with the prominent white Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute positioned in the center-left and adjacent buildings extending to the right.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing an expansive aerial view of Venice, Italy. The scene is dominated by the vibrant blue-green water of a major canal, with several small motorboats creating white wakes as they traverse its surface. Along the waterfront, the city's historic architecture is on full display, featuring a prominent white stone basilica with a large dome, adjacent buildings with red-tiled roofs, and a distant bell tower. There is no single main subject, as the composition is intentionally broad to emphasize the grand scale and unique atmosphere of the iconic city. The focus is on the overall environment and the interplay between the water and the dense, historic urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high, observational vantage point, the scene captures a wide view of Venice, Italy, on a hazy day. The turquoise waters of a wide canal fill the foreground, with several motorboats creating white wakes as they travel across its surface. On the far bank, the city's dense architecture features buildings with terracotta-tiled roofs. Dominating the skyline is the large, white stone Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute with its prominent dome, situated next to the long, low-lying Punta della Dogana building. In the background, a body of water is visible, with several buildings located beyond it, adding depth to the scene. The cityscape stretches into the distance, where industrial port cranes are visible under a pale blue sky with light cloud cover.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

In the foreground and lower center of the frame, a group of cyclists ride from left to right, occupying most of the visible space. The middle ground features a row of market stalls with colorful umbrellas stretching horizontally across the frame, while pedestrians move between them. In the background, tall modern office buildings rise along the top edge of the frame, with a large digital billboard on the top right displaying advertisements. Throughout the video, the camera remains fixed, and the spatial arrangement of subjects does not change.",
