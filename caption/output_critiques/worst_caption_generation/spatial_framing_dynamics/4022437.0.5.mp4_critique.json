    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot, filmed at the subject's level, initially frames the back of a tan leather car seat in the left foreground. To the right, in the middle ground, is the front passenger seat, with an open door and a sunroof visible at the top of the frame. The camera then executes a slow downward tilt. This movement brings the rear of the center console, featuring an air vent, into view in the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground between the seats, while the sunroof moves out of the top of the frame. By the end of the shot, the storage pockets on the backs of both front seats are visible at the bottom left and bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures an interior view of a car from a position just behind the front left seat, facing the front right seat. The tan leather car seats are prominently featured, with the back of the front left seat, showcasing its stitched seams and lower storage pocket, in the foreground. To the right, the front passenger seat with its headrest is visible. Above, a rectangular, tinted glass sunroof is set into the light-colored roof lining, with a grab handle near the right side. As the camera moves downward and tilts slightly, the rear section of the center console comes into view between the front seats. This console is crafted from dark, polished wood and is complemented by silver trim, including a silver-trimmed air vent. The front passenger door is open, revealing a bright exterior through the window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a car with tan leather upholstery, viewed from the back seat looking toward the front passenger side. The back of one front seat occupies the left foreground, while the passenger seat with its headrest is in the middle ground on the right. The passenger door is open, revealing a bright, sunlit exterior with a building visible in the distance. A glass sunroof is seen at the top of the interior. The view slowly tilts downward, bringing a rear center console into frame, which features a silver-trimmed air vent and a dark wood-grain accent.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To the left, a small wooden table with a glass of water sits in the foreground, while a window with closed curtains occupies the background on the right. The camera slowly pans to the left, shifting the plant toward the right side of the frame and bringing a bookshelf into view along the left edge in the background. Throughout the shot, the camera remains above the subjects, looking down at them, and no significant height changes occur relative to the main elements.",
