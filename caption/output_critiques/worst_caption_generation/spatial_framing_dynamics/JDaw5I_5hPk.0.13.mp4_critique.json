    "pre_caption": "This is a stationary wide shot of a coastal landscape, focusing on the scenery rather than a single subject. The bottom half of the frame is filled with turbulent ocean waves in the foreground and middle ground, which crash against rock formations. A sea stack is positioned in the lower-left to center middle ground, while a larger cliff face occupies the right side of the frame. In the background, a clear sky fills the top half of the frame, where a flock of birds flies from left to right across the top left quadrant. The camera is positioned at a straight-on angle to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic seascape scenery shot capturing a powerful ocean scene. Turbulent, turquoise waves with white foamy crests crash violently against large, dark, rugged sea stacks and a towering cliff face under a clear, light-blue sky. A flock of birds flies in a loose formation across the upper portion of the frame, adding a sense of life to the vast landscape. The video does not have a single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and raw, untamed atmosphere of the coastal environment. The composition emphasizes the powerful interplay between the sea and the land rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a clear day under a light blue sky, a flock of birds flies in formation above a turbulent turquoise ocean. Large, dark, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack and a larger cliff face on the right, rise from the water. White-capped waves continuously crash against the rocks, sending white spray into the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject is positioned in the center foreground, facing the camera, with their upper body visible from the waist up. To the left of the frame, a bicycle leans against the bridge railing in the middle ground, while a small dog sits at the subject’s feet in the lower right foreground. In the background, a dense forest fills the upper half of the frame, with tree branches extending into the top left and top right corners. The camera is set at the subject’s eye level, maintaining a straight-on perspective throughout the stationary shot. No significant movement occurs within the frame.",
