    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a resort patio from an eye-level perspective. Initially, a round, glass-topped table occupies the bottom-center foreground, with two lounge chairs positioned in the middle ground on the right. A low white wall runs horizontally across the scene, separating the patio from a background of dense green trees. The camera then slowly pans to the left, shifting the table to the bottom-right foreground. This movement reveals a sandy area and a large tree trunk in the left and center middle ground, while the lounge chairs move to the far right of the frame. The white wall and the background foliage remain consistently visible throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a resort scenery shot depicting a private outdoor patio. The scene features a modern concrete patio with dark wicker furniture, including a round, glass-topped table with a small white box on it and lounge chairs with grey cushions, set against a low white wall. Beyond the patio lies a small area of sand and a dense backdrop of lush green tropical trees and plants, creating a secluded, natural ambiance. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow pan is intended to showcase the environment and atmosphere of the space. The focus is on conveying a sense of tranquility and the blend of modern comfort with nature, rather than on a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a tranquil, tropical patio setting during the daytime, showcasing two distinct sections: a paved area and a small sandy zone. The paved area features a grey floor, furnished with two lounge chairs with dark frames and grey cushions, and a round, glass-topped table with a dark woven base, on which a small white box is placed. The sandy zone is home to a large tree with a thick, gnarled trunk. A low, white wall separates these two private areas from a dense wall of lush green trees and foliage, enhancing the natural, secluded ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a city street viewed from a slightly elevated angle. A red bicycle is parked in the lower right foreground, while a street vendor’s cart occupies the center middle ground. Several pedestrians are visible walking from left to right in the background, passing by a row of tall buildings that stretch across the top of the frame. As the camera tilts downward, the bicycle becomes more prominent in the lower center, and a small dog enters from the left, moving toward the cart. The vendor’s cart remains stationary, while the pedestrians gradually exit the frame to the right. The camera maintains its height above the subjects throughout the shot.",
