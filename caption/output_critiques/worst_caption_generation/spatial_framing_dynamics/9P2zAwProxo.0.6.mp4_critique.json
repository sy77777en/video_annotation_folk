    "pre_caption": "This first-person perspective shot combines a close-up of a snowboard with a wide shot of the scenery. The rounded tip of the snowboard is fixed in the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame from the center. The snow-covered ground extends from the foreground into the middle ground, appearing to rush toward the camera as it moves forward. In the background, a group of bare trees is positioned on the top left, moving from the center toward the left edge of the frame as the snowboard glides past them. The camera is positioned above the snowboard, looking down at its tip and forward along the path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This locked-on POV view video features a close-up of the front tip of a snowboard. The snowboard, which occupies the lower half of the perspective, is white or a very light cream color with a rounded nose. Its surface has a slightly mottled or textured appearance from clinging snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera, mounted on a snowboard, glides swiftly down a snow-covered hillside during the day. The ground is completely blanketed in white snow, with the rounded, off-white tip of the snowboard visible in the foreground. In the background and to the left, a dense collection of bare, dark tree trunks and thin branches stands against the white landscape, passing by as the camera moves forward.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is mounted on a snowboard, capturing a close-up of the board and a wide shot of the scene ahead as it slides downhill.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The cyclist is positioned in the lower right of the frame, occupying the foreground, while the road curves from the bottom left to the center, leading into the background. On either side of the road, grassy fields stretch into the middle ground, with a row of houses visible in the background along the top edge of the frame. The camera is placed at eye level with the cyclist, tracking smoothly alongside as the cyclist moves forward, causing the scenery to shift gradually from right to left across the frame.",
