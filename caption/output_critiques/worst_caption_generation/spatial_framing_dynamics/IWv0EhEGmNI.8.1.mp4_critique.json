    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, the scene begins with an assault rifle held in the foreground at the bottom right, aimed past a paneled door on the left. The camera then moves forward and pans right, shifting the view into a hallway. A man emerges in the middle ground, framed centrally by a doorway in the background. The player's weapon remains in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, now aimed toward the man. To the right of the man in the background, a small table, a chair, and a plant are visible. On-screen text is positioned with subtitles at the bottom center, a checkpoint notification in the top left, and an ammunition counter in the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is shown from a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night vision scope. The viewer is holding a black assault rifle with a red dot sight. A man with a beard, wearing a head covering and a tactical vest, enters the room with a flashlight in his left hand raised, while his right hand is positioned at his waist holding a gun. On-screen text includes subtitles at the bottom and a heads-up display with a checkpoint notification and an ammunition counter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates a dark interior of a house, viewed through a monochromatic green night-vision filter. The perspective moves from behind a white, paneled door into a hallway, passing a light switch on the wall. In the background, a doorway opens into another room where a figure in tactical gear is visible near a small table, a chair, and a potted plant. The scene features several on-screen overlay elements, including a \"Checkpoint\" notification in the top-left corner, and a heads-up display in the lower-right showing an ammunition count. The subtitles at the bottom incorporate a mix of white, red, and green text for clarity: \"Price:\" in green followed by \"I've lost visual. You're on your own for now.\" in white; \"AI-Qatala Fighter 2:\" in red followed by \"I am going to beat you to death even after you give me the location!\" in white; and \"Hostage:\" in green followed by \"I don't have a location...\" in white. This color-coding helps differentiate between speakers and enhances the viewing experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a woman seated at a desk in the center foreground, facing slightly to the left of the frame. A large window occupies the background, stretching across the top right and top center, with sunlight streaming in. To the left in the middle ground, a bookshelf filled with books and a small lamp is visible. The camera is positioned slightly above the woman’s head, looking down at her workspace. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly tilts downward, bringing more of the desk and the objects on it—such as a laptop and a coffee mug—into view. On-screen text appears as a calendar reminder in the top right and a weather update in the bottom left.",
