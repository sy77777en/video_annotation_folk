    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a large illuminated sign reading \"EL RANCHO,\" which occupies the center and upper portion of the frame in the foreground, with additional neon text below it also centered and in the foreground. Behind and below the sign, a geometric glass-topped structure is visible in the middle ground, positioned toward the lower center of the frame. The camera is initially at the same height as the sign, facing it directly. As the sequence progresses, the camera moves forward and tilts downward, causing the sign to move out of the frame above, while the glass-topped structure becomes the new focus, now occupying the center of the frame in the foreground. By the end of the sequence, the sign is no longer visible, and the camera is positioned above the glass-topped structure, looking down at it from a higher vantage point. The background remains dark, with rain and occasional lightning, and no other major elements or subjects are present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large illuminated sign displaying the words \"EL RANCHO\" in bold, bright letters, with additional neon text below reading \"Floor Show Susan Alexander Kane Twice Nightly.\" Behind and below the sign is a geometric, glass-topped structure. As the camera moves forward and downward, it takes the sign out of frame and focuses on the glass-topped structure by the end of the sequence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors at night, featuring the exterior of a venue with a large illuminated sign reading \"EL RANCHO\" in bold, bright letters, accompanied by smaller neon text below that states \"Floor Show,\" \"Susan Alexander Kane,\" and \"Twice Nightly.\" The sign is mounted on a metal framework, with the lights casting a glow against the dark background. Below and behind the sign, a glass-paneled canopy is visible, its geometric sections illuminated by the light from inside the canopy. The entire scene is set in heavy rain with occasional lightning, and the overall scene is dimly lit except for the prominent signage. There are no visible people, and the environment is defined by the contrast between the bright sign and the shadowy surroundings. The video contains no overlays apart from the illuminated signage, which is part of the physical scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a bronze statue of a horse, which is positioned in the lower right of the frame in the foreground. To the left and slightly behind the statue, a row of small potted plants lines the middle ground, stretching from the bottom left to the center of the frame. The camera starts at eye level with the horse statue and slowly pans left, bringing a large stone fountain into view in the center background. As the camera continues to pan, the horse statue moves out of the frame to the right, while the fountain becomes more prominent, now occupying the center and upper portion of the frame in the middle ground. By the end of the sequence, the camera tilts slightly upward, placing the fountain at the top center of the frame, with the potted plants now mostly out of view. The background consists of a brick wall with climbing ivy, and no other significant elements or subjects are present.",
