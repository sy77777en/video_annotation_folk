    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, where a large, multi-tiered grandstand filled with spectators dominates the background, occupying the top and left of the frame. In the middle ground, a group of horses and jockeys is clustered at the bottom left, racing on a dirt track that fills the bottom half of the scene from the foreground to the middle ground. As the horses gallop from left to right around a bend, the camera pans right to follow their movement, simultaneously transitioning into a wide shot. In this new composition, the horses and jockeys become the central focus, moving across the middle of the frame. The initial grandstand moves out of view, replaced by a background of trees, tents, and other distant buildings. The dirt track remains in the bottom portion of the frame, with a white fence and grassy infield visible in the middle ground on the right. A network logo is a fixed overlay in the top right corner. The camera maintains a position at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a horse race on a dirt track with multiple horses and jockeys in motion. The jockeys wear colorful racing silks, including blue, white, and red, and are positioned on the horses, guiding them around a bend. The horses are of various shades of brown and are galloping closely together. The scene is set in a large stadium filled with spectators, visible in the background, with a multi-tiered grandstand and a distinctive spire-topped building. The track is bordered by a white railing, separating the racing area from the grassy infield. The overall atmosphere is dynamic, capturing the intensity and excitement of the race.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a horse racing event from a broadcast POV shot set up for television production. The setting is outdoors at a racetrack, which encircles a well-maintained grassy area. The race takes place during the daytime under an overcast sky, with diffused daylight illuminating the scene. The grandstand, centrally positioned, is a multi-tiered structure featuring two distinctive spires, adding architectural interest. It is filled with spectators on one side, while tents are situated on the grassy area. The racetrack is a dirt path, and the horses, ridden by jockeys in colorful attire, are in motion, kicking up dust as they race. An additional building is located across from the stands, becoming visible only after the horses round a corner, suggesting a bustling event atmosphere. Overlay elements include a network logo in the top right corner, indicating the broadcast nature of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up shot, showing a single cyclist in the center foreground, riding along a paved city street. Tall office buildings fill the background, stretching from the top left to the top right of the frame, while parked cars line the bottom right in the middle ground. The cyclist moves slowly from right to left, and the camera tilts slightly upward to keep the subject in view, shifting into a close-up as the cyclist approaches. As the cyclist passes under a traffic light, the shot transitions with a soft fade to a wide shot of a busy intersection, where several pedestrians cross from the bottom left to the center. The cyclist is now visible in the background, near the top right, while a city bus enters from the left edge. A digital clock overlay appears in the bottom left corner. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains positioned slightly below the subjects’ eye level.",
