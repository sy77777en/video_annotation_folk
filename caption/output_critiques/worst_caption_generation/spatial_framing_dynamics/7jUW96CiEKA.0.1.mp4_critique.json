    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as a wide shot. A bird is initially seen in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, flying low above the water that occupies the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a fallen tree trunk lies horizontally across the frame, with greenery visible behind it. The bird moves from right to left across the middle ground, briefly dipping down to make contact with the water surface near the center-right, causing a splash, before continuing its flight low over the water towards the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bird with dark plumage flying low over a calm body of water. The bird's wings are outstretched, and it appears to be in motion, skimming the surface. The water is reflective, with small ripples and scattered light debris visible. In the background, a fallen tree trunk lies along the water's edge, partially submerged, with some greenery visible beyond it. The bird's movement creates a subtle disturbance in the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor setting by a calm body of water, likely a river or pond, surrounded by natural elements. The time of day is not explicitly clear, but the lighting suggests a tranquil atmosphere. The water's surface is smooth, reflecting the surrounding environment, with occasional ripples indicating movement. In the background, fallen logs and sparse vegetation are visible, adding texture and depth to the scene. The environment is peaceful, with subtle activity on the water's surface, possibly from wildlife. The overall color palette is natural, with earthy tones from the logs and greenery, complemented by the muted hues of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To the right, a red ball is placed in the middle ground near the center. In the background, a wooden fence runs horizontally across the frame, with a bicycle leaning against it on the far right. The dog remains stationary while the ball rolls slowly from the center toward the bottom right, coming to a stop near the dog's front paws. The camera is angled slightly above the subjects, looking down at them.",
