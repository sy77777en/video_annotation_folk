    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot from a first-person perspective. Initially, the frame is dominated by a tiled wall on the right, featuring a circular light in the right middle ground. A series of repeating arches recedes from the middle ground into the background, creating a central corridor. As the camera moves forward through the corridor at eye level, the arches in the middle ground pass by, and a bright light source at the far end of the passage in the background becomes more visible, revealing a set of stairs. The circular light on the right wall moves from the right middle ground to the right foreground before exiting the frame. A similar, fainter light is briefly visible on the left wall in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot of a long, eerie corridor with a distinct liminal quality. The walls and ceiling are covered in small, greenish-yellow tiles, and the space recedes into the distance through a series of repeating arches, creating a disorienting effect. The scene is dimly illuminated by two glowing circular light fixtures, one on the right-hand wall and another on the left-hand wall, along with a brighter, unseen light source at the far end of the passage. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the unsettling and seemingly endless nature of the environment itself, emphasizing the atmosphere of isolation and mystery over any particular entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV, as if through a character's eyes, the perspective moves forward through a long, hazy corridor with a distinct greenish-yellow color cast. The walls and floor are uniformly covered in a grid of small, square tiles. The space is defined by a series of repeating, rounded archways that create a tunnel-like passage. Two circular, flush-mounted lights, one on each wall, illuminate the immediate area. An unidentified light source at the far end of the corridor limits visibility, partially obscuring the length of the hallway.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The frame centers on a wooden table in the foreground, with a small potted plant positioned at the bottom left and a stack of books at the bottom right. In the middle ground, a person stands near the center, facing away from the camera, while a large window occupies the top right background, letting in natural light. As the camera slowly tilts upward, the person moves slightly to the left, and a hanging clock becomes visible in the top center background. The camera remains at waist height relative to the person throughout the shot, and no significant changes in shot size or subject position occur.",
