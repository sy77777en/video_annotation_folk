    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot focusing on a man positioned centrally in the foreground. He is seated on a ski lift chair that occupies the bottom portion of the frame, also in the foreground. Bare trees are visible on the left side in the middle ground. The background, seen primarily in the center and right of the frame, consists of a snowy ski resort landscape, including slopes, buildings, and other chairlift structures. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin and a blond beard, wearing a black ski helmet and large black ski goggles that cover his eyes. He is dressed in a mostly black jacket with white long sleeves and black accents on the shoulders, along with black gloves. The man is seated on a black ski lift chair, looking directly at the camera and smiling. His left arm rests along the back of the chair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot captures a man riding a chairlift at a snowy ski resort during the daytime. The man wears a black helmet, dark ski goggles reflecting slightly, a black vest over a white-sleeved jacket, and black gloves. His left arm is positioned on the black padded safety bar of the chairlift. Below and behind him, the snow-covered landscape features bare trees, visible ski slopes with distant skiers, resort buildings, and other chairlift structures under an overcast sky. The perspective suggests upward movement on the lift, offering a view of the resort base area and surrounding wooded hills.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
