    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a tabletop with various items. A board featuring a dolphin image is positioned slightly to the right of the center in the middle ground, occupying 80% of the frame's height. To its left and slightly behind it in the middle ground, a black landline telephone rests. In the middle ground, to the left of the dolphin board and in front of the telephone, several pens lie on the tabletop. A grey calculator is also in the middle ground, positioned near the telephone and behind the pens. A silver computer mouse is partially visible in the foreground at the bottom left corner. The light-colored wooden tabletop occupies the foreground and middle ground, with a plain, light-colored wall in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A rectangular board, standing upright on a light-colored wooden tabletop, features a black-and-white photographic cutout of a dolphin's head and upper body emerging from choppy water. The dolphin, facing left with its mouth open revealing small teeth, has a yellow and orange striped party hat collaged onto its head. The background of the board behind the dolphin image is light-colored with thin vertical lines. Behind and to the left of this board, a black landline telephone with a handset resting on its base is visible. To the left of the dolphin board and in front of the telephone, several pens lie on the tabletop; one is black, another is white, and to the right of the white pen is a third pen with a dark cap. There is also a fourth pen that is possibly blue. Behind these pens and near the telephone, there is a grey square-shaped device that appears to be a calculator. A silver computer mouse is partially visible in the bottom left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an indoor shot of a light-colored wooden desk. In the middleground, a rectangular board stands upright, displaying a black and white image of a dolphin emerging from water with its mouth open. A yellow and orange striped party hat is collaged onto the dolphin's head, and the board has a light background with faint vertical lines. To the left and slightly behind the board, a black landline telephone with a keypad and coiled cord rests on the desk. Near the telephone, there is a gray rectangular flat object that appears to be a calculator. In front of the telephone, four pens lie on the desk: one black, one white, one with a dark cap, and one blue. A silver computer mouse is partially visible on the far left. The background consists of a plain, light-colored wall. The lighting is even, suggesting an indoor environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video showcases a tabletop with various items. A board featuring a dolphin image is positioned slightly to the right of the center, occupying 80% of the frame's height. A telephone is behind the dolphin board. To the left, there are some pens. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a kitchen countertop. A large glass bowl filled with oranges is centered in the foreground, occupying about half the frame’s width and extending from the bottom to the middle of the frame. To the right of the bowl in the foreground, a stainless steel toaster sits near the edge of the counter. In the middle ground, a white ceramic teapot is placed to the left of the bowl, with its handle facing outward. A loaf of bread on a wooden cutting board is visible in the background, positioned slightly to the right. The countertop surface, a dark granite, spans the entire foreground and middle ground, while white tiled walls form the background. The camera is positioned slightly above the countertop, angled downward toward the subjects.",
