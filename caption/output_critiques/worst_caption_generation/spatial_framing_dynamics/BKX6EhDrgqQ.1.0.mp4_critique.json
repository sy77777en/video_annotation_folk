    "pre_caption": "This high-angle video begins with a full shot of a 3D figure and a kiosk located in the center middle ground. The figure stands on a patterned platform that occupies the bottom of the frame, with a large, patterned sphere to the right in the middle ground and another partial sphere in the bottom left foreground. As the figure walks a short distance toward the kiosk, the shot transitions to a medium full shot, with both the figure and the kiosk remaining in the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 3D-rendered male figure with short, dark hair and a metallic, grey skin tone stands with his back to the viewer. He is wearing a light grey, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. The figure is positioned in front of a tall, white, freestanding kiosk that has a large, blank, vertical screen. He walks closely toward the machine and pauses in front of it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a minimalist, abstract space against a dark gray gradient background, a stylized figure stands on a white, rounded platform. This platform, along with other large spherical shapes in the scene, is marked with black, wavy lines resembling wood grain. The figure is positioned in front of a tall, white, freestanding kiosk that features a large, blank vertical screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

A cat sits on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, partially obscured by a stack of books that extends from the bottom right to the center. As the cat stretches toward the plant, the camera slowly zooms out to a wide shot, revealing a window in the top left background and a chair in the top right. Throughout the video, the camera remains at the same height as the cat.",
