    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a single, ancient-looking mechanical device positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. The device is angled slightly, showing its front and left side. It rests on a dark surface that extends from the middle ground into the foreground. The background is entirely black and undefined. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, ancient-looking mechanical device stands upright against a black background. It is a rectangular, box-like object made of a light gray, weathered metal with a rough, textured surface. The front face features two large, circular dials, one positioned above the other. Each dial is composed of multiple concentric rings with intricate, finely-etched markings and symbols. A metallic pointer extends from the center of each dial. On the left side of the box, a circular knob or crank protrudes. The device is lit from the front and top with a cool, bluish light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space, a rectangular, box-like device with a weathered, metallic texture stands upright. The object is illuminated by a cool, blue-toned light from both the top and front, creating a soft glow on the dark surface it rests on. Its front face features two large, circular dials arranged vertically, each detailed with concentric rings of markings and a central pointer. A small, circular knob protrudes from the left side of the device. An overlay displaying \"[15]\" is visible in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The background features a large window occupying most of the right side, through which a cityscape is visible. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects’ eye level and remains stationary throughout the shot. No significant movement occurs among the subjects or elements during the scene.",
