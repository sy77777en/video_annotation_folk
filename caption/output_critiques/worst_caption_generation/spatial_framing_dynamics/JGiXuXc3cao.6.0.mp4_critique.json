    "pre_caption": "A full shot centers on a hand-drawn ship in the middle ground. The ship is positioned on a choppy sea that occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. A dark, cloudy sky fills the top half of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at the ship's height, and the composition remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A static, hand-drawn illustration depicts a research-style vessel on a choppy sea. The ship features a blue hull, a reddish-brown bottom, and a white, multi-level superstructure. A tall central mast flies a small American flag, with a smaller mast located further aft. A white crane is positioned on the stern deck. The vessel is surrounded by dark, turbulent water with whitecaps, set against a backdrop of a dark, cloudy sky. A few rays of sunlight penetrate the clouds, illuminating the vessel and the surface of the sea.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated, hand-drawn style, a blue and white ship sails on a choppy, dark sea. The sky is overcast with heavy, dark clouds, though beams of sunlight break through to illuminate the vessel. The ship has a blue hull, a white superstructure with multiple decks, and several masts, one of which flies a small American flag. The water is depicted with dark tones and white crests, suggesting turbulent conditions.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",

Several large trees occupy the left side of the frame in the middle ground, partially obscuring a small station building in the background at the top left. The sky is clear and bright, filling the upper half of the frame. The camera is angled slightly above the train, looking down at it, and remains stationary throughout the shot with no zoom or movement.",
