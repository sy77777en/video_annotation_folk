    "pre_caption": "This medium shot is composed with significant depth, placing subjects across multiple planes. In the foreground on the left, the back and side of a person are visible as they aim a large weapon toward the background. Bright orange flames occupy the bottom-left corner of the foreground. In the middle ground, positioned on the bottom-right, is the top of a person's head wearing a gold party hat. A muzzle flash and sparks travel from the middle ground toward the background. Centered in the background, a man with his upper body visible stands framed within a doorway. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an indoor setting, a man with dark hair, seen from the back and side, is firing a large, dark, military-style weapon, which is emitting a muzzle flash and sparks. Bright orange flames are visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the shooter. In the background, standing in a doorway, a man with a light-to-medium skin tone, short dark hair, and a goatee reacts with his hands raised and his mouth open in an expression of shock. He is wearing a gray t-shirt with a colorful graphic on it. In the middle ground, the top of a bald man's head is visible, adorned with a shiny, gold, conical party hat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is set within a room, looking towards a hallway in the background. The hallway is illuminated by a single wall-mounted light fixture, where a man stands in the doorway with his arms raised. In the foreground, a person aims a large, dark weapon, from which a bright muzzle flash and sparks erupt toward the man in the doorway. A large, bright orange flame is visible in the bottom left corner. Between the person with the weapon and the hallway, another individual is seen wearing a gold, conical party hat.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a shooting scene in an indoor setting. In the foreground, a person is firing a gun, with sparks and a bullet coming from the barrel. The person holding the gun is partially visible, showing part of their face and hands. In the background, a man in gray is reacting to the firing, with his upper body visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The subject is facing forward, with their hands resting on a stack of books that occupy the bottom center of the foreground. To the left background, a large window reveals a cityscape, while a potted plant sits on the windowsill in the top left corner. A coffee mug is placed at the bottom right foreground. The camera is set at eye level with the seated subject. No significant movement or changes in spatial arrangement occur during the shot.",
