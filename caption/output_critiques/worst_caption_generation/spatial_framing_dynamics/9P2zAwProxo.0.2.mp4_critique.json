    "pre_caption": "A man is featured in a medium shot, positioned in the center foreground of the frame. The camera is held at his level, creating a self-shot perspective as he moves forward down a wide, snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the background. A forest of bare trees lines the slope in the middle ground and background on both the left and right sides of the frame. As the man and camera move forward, the background scenery scrolls past, with the trees on the sides moving from the middle ground toward the edges of the frame, while the man remains consistently centered.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is featured on a snowy slope, looking directly at the camera from a level angle, suggesting a self-shot perspective. He is dressed for winter sports, wearing a black helmet and large, blue-tinted ski goggles that reflect the sky. A black neck gaiter covers his neck. He is wearing a black jacket with white buttons and white sleeves. He is also wearing black gloves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed using a selfie stick, captures them moving down a wide, snow-covered ski slope during the day. The slope is bordered by a forest of bare, leafless trees under an overcast sky. The person is dressed in winter gear, including a black helmet, blue-tinted goggles, a black jacket with white buttons and white sleeves, and black gloves. The packed snow shows tracks, and more trees are visible in the background on the rolling terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

She remains stationary while a group of people walk from the left foreground toward the center middle ground, passing in front of her. In the top left of the frame, a large fountain occupies the foreground, with water visibly spraying upward. The camera does not move, and all subjects maintain their positions relative to the frame throughout the video.",
