    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a bustling urban street, capturing the vibrant cityscape. The camera is positioned at street level, providing a first-person perspective as if walking along the sidewalk. In the initial scene, the tiled sidewalk with a yellow tactile path runs from the bottom left to the center, leading the viewer's eye into the middle ground where people walk past shops on the left and a bus or subway station with a metallic roof on the right. The buildings with large windows and colorful signage form the background, framing the scene vertically. As the video transitions, the camera moves forward towards a busy crosswalk, maintaining the wide shot. The crosswalk occupies the bottom of the frame, with pedestrians moving from the bottom to the middle ground, surrounded by tall buildings and traffic signals in the background. The camera remains at the height of the pedestrians, emphasizing the dynamic movement and scale of the urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the vibrant atmosphere of an urban street. The focus is on the bustling environment, showcasing a lively street with people walking along a tiled sidewalk lined with shops and advertisements. The scene transitions to a busy crosswalk, where pedestrians move purposefully across the street, surrounded by tall buildings and traffic signals. The emphasis is on the dynamic and energetic ambiance of city life, rather than any specific individual or object, highlighting the scale and activity of the urban setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigating a bustling urban street. The setting is outdoors in a city environment, likely during the day, given the bright natural light illuminating the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings featuring large windows and colorful signage, adding a vibrant touch to the urban landscape. The sidewalk is paved with gray tiles, interspersed with a distinctive yellow tactile path for visually impaired pedestrians. People are walking along the street, some heading towards a crosswalk where traffic lights manage the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. A bus or subway station with a metallic-colored roof is situated along the sidewalk. The scene captures the dynamic movement of city life, with individuals dressed in casual attire, some carrying bags, as they move purposefully through the urban environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up shot of a single cyclist riding along a quiet rural path. The camera is positioned slightly above the cyclist’s head, looking down at an angle as the subject moves from the bottom left toward the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. On the right side of the frame in the middle ground, a wooden fence runs parallel to the path, while a small pond is visible in the background on the left. As the video progresses, the camera slowly pans right, following the cyclist as they approach a wooden bridge that appears in the center background. The shot size remains consistent, keeping the cyclist’s upper body and the handlebars in view. The camera maintains its elevated position above the subject throughout, emphasizing the downward perspective and the spatial relationship between the cyclist, the path, and the surrounding landscape.",
