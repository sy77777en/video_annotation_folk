    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a light brown camel resting on the ground, occupying the center and right portions of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground. To the left, the rear half of another camel is visible in the middle ground, while the legs of a third camel stand in the top center background. A low stone wall sits in the background on the right. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then slowly zooms in, transitioning the composition to a medium shot that focuses on the head and upper body of the main camel in the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a camel lying on sandy ground, prominently positioned in the foreground. The camel has a light brown coat and is adorned with a colorful bridle featuring red and yellow decorations. It is equipped with a saddle covered by a patchwork of blankets in various colors, including gray and green. The camel's head is turned slightly towards the camera, and its expression is neutral. In the middle ground on the left, another camel is partially visible, with a lighter coat and colorful blankets. Additionally, there is another camel partially visible behind the first camel. The setting suggests a desert environment, with the camels resting on the sand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting under the warm, golden light of the sun, a light brown camel rests on dusty, sandy ground. The camel, which is lying down, wears a halter adorned with a small red and yellow tassel and has a chain around its neck. On its back is a saddle covered by a dark grey blanket and other colorful, layered fabrics. To the left, another camel, lighter in color, is also resting, with a red blanket visible on its back. The ground is uneven, and a low stone wall sits in the background, with long shadows cast across the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

In the background, a wooden fence runs horizontally from the left to the center, with a small tree visible at the top right. A person wearing a red jacket is partially visible in the bottom right corner, positioned in the middle ground. The camera is slightly above the horse’s head, angling downward. As the camera slowly pans to the right, the horse moves toward the center of the frame, while the person in the red jacket exits the shot. The tree and fence remain in the background throughout, maintaining their positions relative to the frame.",
