    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a city park, captured from a standard height. A paved walkway begins at the bottom center of the frame, extending into the middle ground toward a tall monument located in the center. This central path is flanked by trees and benches in the foreground and middle ground, with a large building visible in the background across the top of the frame. The camera then pulls backward, transitioning the scene into an extreme wide shot. This movement reveals more of the park, including grassy areas in the foreground and middle ground on both the left and right, as well as various people walking and sitting on benches and the grass. A logo overlay remains fixed in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a public park or square on a bright day. A wide, paved walkway leads through the center of the frame towards a tall, light-colored monument, with a large, multi-story residential building visible in the background. The scene is framed by lush, green trees and dotted with wooden benches along the path and on the surrounding lawns, where various people appear, enjoying the park—some sit, others stroll, and a child runs. There is no single main subject; the focus is on establishing the environment and capturing the tranquil, everyday atmosphere of the urban green space. The shot emphasizes the scale and collective life of the location rather than a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a city park during the late afternoon, with long shadows cast across the grounds. In the background, a large, multi-story building with numerous windows stands behind a line of tall, leafy green trees. A wide, light-colored paved walkway extends from the foreground toward a tall, rectangular stone monument at its center. Dark wooden benches are positioned along the path, where several people are seen walking, sitting, and relaxing. The camera slowly pulls back, gradually revealing more of the benches, people, and surrounding grass. A white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a single cyclist positioned in the bottom left of the frame, riding along a narrow dirt trail that curves toward the top right. The cyclist is in the foreground, while a small pond occupies the middle ground in the center and right portions of the frame. In the background, a row of wind turbines stretches across the top edge. The camera is angled slightly downward from above the cyclist’s head. As the scene progresses, the camera pans right, following the cyclist as they move toward the center, while the pond and turbines remain visible but shift toward the left side of the frame. A digital clock overlay is fixed in the top left corner throughout the video.",
