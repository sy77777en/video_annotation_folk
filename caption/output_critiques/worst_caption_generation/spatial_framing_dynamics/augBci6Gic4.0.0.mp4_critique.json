    "pre_caption": "The video displays a static full shot, maintaining this framing throughout. A person sits on a chair located in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. They are illuminated by a spotlight, casting a shadow directly in front of them towards the bottom center on the floor, which is also in the middle ground. A white outline is visible on the floor in the bottom center, positioned in the middle ground just before the shadow. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person, likely a man, sitting on a chair facing forward in the center of the frame, illuminated by a single spotlight from above and slightly behind. The person is mostly in silhouette due to the strong backlighting, which casts a long shadow directly in front of them onto the dark floor. They are wearing a light-colored beanie or head covering, a dark long-sleeved shirt, and over it, a short-sleeved shirt with colorful patterns visible on the shoulders and upper chest where the light hits. They are also wearing dark pants and shoes. Their hands rest on their thighs or knees, palms slightly upturned or outward. The area surrounding the shadow is illuminated by a halo or light spot from above. In front of the shadow, at the middle bottom of the frame, is a white outline resembling a chalk or tape body outline from a crime scene. The surrounding area is completely dark.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors within a completely dark space, possibly a studio or stage. A single spotlight shines down from above, creating a distinct circle of light on the dark floor. Within this illuminated area, a white chalk outline resembling the shape of a body is positioned in front of a simple wooden stool, at the middle bottom of the frame. A person sits on the stool, facing forward, largely obscured in silhouette due to the strong backlighting from the spotlight. Hints of color and pattern are visible on the person's shirt, contrasted with dark pants. Their hands rest on their knees with palms facing upwards. The surrounding environment outside the spotlight remains in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To the left, a small table with a stack of books sits in the middle ground, occupying the bottom left of the frame. In the background, a window is visible in the top center, letting in natural light. The camera is angled slightly downward, positioned above the level of the plant and table. As the video continues, the camera slowly pans left, bringing the table and books to the center of the frame while the plant moves out of view. The window remains visible in the background throughout the shot, and the camera maintains its elevated height relative to the scene.",
