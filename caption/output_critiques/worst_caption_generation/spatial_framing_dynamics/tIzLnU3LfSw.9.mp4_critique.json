    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from an elevated position, a hockey player in a navy jersey begins in the middle ground, slightly right of center, skating towards the left. The camera pans left, following the player as he moves across the ice toward the goal, which enters the frame from the left. As he approaches the goal, now positioned on the left side of the frame, he shoots the puck. After scoring, the player skates away from the goal toward the center of the frame, raising his stick in celebration. Other teammates skate in from the right and bottom of the frame to join him in the center, while the shot maintains its wide perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a male hockey player, number 28, in a navy blue jersey with red and white trim, red pants, and a white helmet with a navy blue stripe. He is seen skating with a black hockey stick and successfully shooting a puck into a red-framed, white-netted hockey goal. After scoring, he celebrates by raising his stick and skating with his arms uplifted.Several other male hockey players are on the ice, including opponents in gold jerseys with black and white trim, and a goalie with larger pads and a gold and black mask. Teammates of the main subject, in similar navy blue and red uniforms, join in the celebration, with another player approaching the main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an indoor ice hockey arena, viewed from an elevated, sideline perspective. The rink consists of white ice marked with blue and red lines, enclosed by boards and protective glass. The boards are covered with various advertisements, including logos for \"Wegmans Market\" and \"Skytop Lodge.\" In the background, spectators are seated in tiered stands. At one end of the ice, a hockey goal with a red frame and white net is positioned. Several players are on the ice; one team wears dark blue jerseys with red trim, while the opposing team is in light-colored jerseys with black and gold accents. Throughout the sequence, the players skate across the ice, culminating in a player in a dark blue jersey scoring a goal and raising their stick in celebration as teammates skate in to join them.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "In a medium shot taken from ground level, a soccer referee in a bright yellow uniform stands in the foreground at the left edge of the frame, holding a red card. The camera remains stationary as two players in white jerseys approach from the right middle ground, stopping near the referee. The referee raises the red card toward the player closest to the center, who reacts by stepping back toward the background. A third player enters from the bottom right, moving diagonally across the frame to stand beside the referee. Throughout the shot, the referee remains at the left foreground, while the players shift positions between the middle ground and background, with the camera maintaining its height at the subjects’ waist level.",
