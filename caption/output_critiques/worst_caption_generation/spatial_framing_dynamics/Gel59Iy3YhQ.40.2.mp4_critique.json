    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle, first-person perspective, a dark, textured arm in the foreground extends upward toward the center of the frame, where an open book rests on a shelf in the middle ground. A hand grips a handle in the center of the book and pushes it, before two hands push the entire bookshelf section upward and backward. This section, which occupied the middle ground, rotates away, revealing a dark, narrow passage in the center of the frame. The viewpoint then moves forward and tilts down, looking into the passage. Two curved, metallic rails enter the immediate foreground, framing the view down the long passage that recedes into the background, ending at a small, faint light in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, first-person perspective, a dark, textured arm reaches toward an open book on a high shelf. The book has a light-colored cover and its open pages feature black text covered with large, detailed illustrations of reddish-brown butterfly wings. There is a rectangular hollow in the lower middle part of the book, with a golden handle in the center. A hand grips the handle and pushes it upward, then continues to push the bookshelf, causing the bookshelf to rotate upward. This action reveals a hidden, narrow passage, through which the view shows dark wooden walls with a line of bricks on both sides and two curved, metallic-looking rails standing upright along the wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, is set within a dimly lit room lined with dark wooden bookshelves. On an upper shelf, an open book is propped up, with large, reddish-brown butterfly wings attached to its pages. A dark, textured arm reaches out to grip the handle in the open book, pushing it upward, while both hands together push a section of the bookshelf, causing it to slide upward and backward, revealing a narrow, dark passage. The view then moves to peer down into the passage, where a faint light can be seen in the distance, coming from a small rectangular window.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "bad_caption": "A medium shot frames a brightly lit kitchen countertop occupying the lower half of the frame, with a large glass bowl positioned at the center-right in the foreground. A pair of gloved hands enters from the left, holding a whisk above the bowl, while a carton of eggs sits near the bottom left edge in the middle ground. The camera is positioned slightly above the countertop, looking down at a shallow angle. As the scene progresses, the hands crack an egg and pour its contents into the bowl, then begin whisking in a circular motion. The camera slowly tilts upward, revealing a row of spice jars lined up along the back edge of the counter in the background, stretching from the left to the right side of the frame. No significant changes in subject height occur, and the camera maintains its elevated position relative to the countertop throughout the shot.",
