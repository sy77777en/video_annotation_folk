    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of five metallic soldier figures, showing them from the waist up. They are arranged in a diagonal line, with the soldier on the right positioned in the foreground and the others receding into the middle ground towards the left against a background wall. The camera, positioned at the soldiers' level, then pulls back slowly. This movement reveals that the soldiers are framed within a white window, which is located in the center of the screen. In the final composition, the white window frame occupies the foreground, while the soldiers are now seen in the middle ground through the window.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A row of at least five identical, human-like soldier figures are shown from the waist up. The figures appear to be made of a shiny, silver-colored metal, giving them a statuesque quality. Each soldier wears a military helmet and a uniform with a high collar and straps crossing the chest. They are all positioned standing at attention in a straight line, facing forward and slightly to their left. The view pulls back to reveal that the soldiers are seen through a white-framed window, as if they are passengers inside a train car.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting against a light-colored, vertically paneled wooden wall, a row of silver, metallic soldier figurines stands at attention. The figurines wear helmets and uniforms with straps across their chests, and bright light reflects off their polished surfaces. The view slowly pulls back to reveal that the scene is actually seen through a train window.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows five human-like soldiers appearing to be made of metal, with only their upper torsos visible. The camera then zooms out, revealing a small portion of an object resembling a train and showing human-like subjects visible through the train window.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a single glass vase placed at the center of the frame in the foreground. The vase is positioned on a wooden table that stretches horizontally across the bottom of the screen, with the table surface occupying the lower third. In the background, a large window fills the upper half of the frame, showing a blurred garden scene. The camera is angled slightly above the vase, looking down at it. As the video progresses, the camera slowly tilts upward, shifting the focus from the vase to the window, so that the garden outside becomes the main element in the center background, while the vase and table move out of view toward the bottom edge of the frame.",
