    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of three women positioned in the middle ground: one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right, all standing before a background wall. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, tilts downward, reframing the scene into a close-up of their lower legs and feet in the foreground. In the final composition, their legs are positioned around a vertical light tube that stands on the floor in the center of the frame, with the prosthetic leg of the woman from the left now prominently visible on the bottom left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three women stand close together under pink and blue lighting. The woman on the left has dark hair and wears a pink double-breasted blazer dress, a large earring, and black heeled sandals. The woman in the center, with long dark hair, smiles while wearing a black and white polka-dot top under a white blazer with white trousers and black heeled sandals. The woman on the right has long, light brown hair and wears a pink, short-sleeved, pleated dress with pink heeled sandals. The woman on the left has a black prosthetic left leg with intricate patterns on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor studio setting, a scene unfolds against a plain wall illuminated by vibrant pink and purple light. A vertical, glowing light tube stands on the floor, casting a bright, cool-toned light. Three women in dresses and heels are positioned around this light source. The camera tilts downward to focus on their lower legs and feet on the reflective floor, revealing that one woman wears a black prosthetic leg with intricate dark patterns, fitted with a black heeled shoe.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot showing two men seated at a table in the middle ground, one on the far left and the other on the far right of the frame, with a large window occupying the background. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, looking down at them. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly zooms in, transitioning to a medium close-up that centers on the man on the right, who is now in the foreground. During this movement, a small dog enters from the bottom center and sits between the two men, remaining in the foreground. The final composition places the man on the right at the center of the frame, the man on the left partially out of view, and the dog at the bottom center, with the window still visible in the background.",
