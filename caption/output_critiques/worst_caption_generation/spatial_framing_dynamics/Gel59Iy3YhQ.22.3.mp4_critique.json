    "pre_caption": "This is a static full shot of a monitor screen, which displays a medium shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. In the foreground of the displayed video, a table extends across the bottom of the frame, with a white cup placed slightly left of its center. The background consists of a wall and a shelf directly behind the woman. Overlaid on this video, white text is fixed in the top right corner, and yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame. The camera filming the woman is positioned at her level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a full shot of a screen displaying a recording of a woman in a medium shot. The woman has long, dark hair with bangs and is wearing a blue jacket over a dark top. She is sitting at a table, facing forward, with a white disposable cup in front of her. The recording has a distinct green tint and visible scan lines, characteristic of an older video format. White text is overlaid in the upper right corner of the screen, showing \"MT-ROOM 3,\" an ID number, a timestamp, and the date \"18/06/94.\" Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is presented as footage on a CRT monitor, characterized by a greenish tint and visible scan lines. The footage captures an indoor room with light-colored walls and a wooden shelf in the background. A woman sits at a table in the foreground, where a white disposable cup is placed. An overlay in the top right corner displays white text on a black background, including \"MT-ROOM 3,\" an identification number, a running timecode around 19:25, and the date \"18/06/94.\" Yellow subtitles with dialogue are present at the bottom of the screen.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This might be a full shot of a screen, suggested by the reflection in the top-right corner. The video playing on the screen appears to be a medium shot of a woman.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
