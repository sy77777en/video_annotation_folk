    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a humanoid figure positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. A lamp is visible in the bottom right foreground, while a window and a door are in the blurred background to the left and right, respectively. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then moves closer to the figure, transitioning to a medium close-up shot while the subject remains centrally framed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid figure with a smooth, featureless, metallic silver face is shown facing forward. Its silver hair is neatly combed back, with individual strands visible. The figure is dressed in a dark blazer over a white V-neck shirt, with the collar of the shirt visible. The visible neck area is made of the same smooth, silver material as the face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room at night, a mannequin-like figure with a featureless silver face and silver hair stands in the center. The figure is wearing a dark blazer over a white shirt. The background is blurred, revealing a French window on the left with a dark night view, a door on the right with a little light visible, and part of a lamp in front of the right side. White subtitles are displayed as an overlay at the bottom of the scene, showing only a small \"[2]\" on the lower left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot showing a large table occupying the left side of the frame in the foreground, with several books stacked on top. A potted plant is placed in the top right background, partially obscured by a tall bookshelf that runs along the right edge of the frame. A cat sits near the bottom center in the middle ground, facing away from the camera. The camera is positioned slightly above the table, looking down at an angle. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly pans right, bringing the bookshelf and plant further into view while the table and books move out of the frame to the left. The cat remains stationary throughout the shot.",
