    "pre_caption": "In this medium shot, a large delivery bag occupies the foreground from the bottom left to the center, held by a person partially visible on the far left. A man in an apron stands in the center-right middle ground, initially holding a cardboard box in the upper center of the frame. He moves the box downwards and forward, placing it inside the delivery bag in the foreground, with his hands following to arrange it. In the background, kitchen equipment is visible on the left and center. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with muscular arms, wearing a blue t-shirt and a beige apron, places a small, rectangular, light brown cardboard box into a large delivery bag. The bag, held by a second person partially seen on the left wearing a red and dark blue jacket, is grey with a silver-colored insulated interior and black straps.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit commercial kitchen, a person wearing a blue shirt and a beige apron places a small, rectangular cardboard container into a large, grey insulated delivery bag. The bag, featuring a silver interior lining and black trim, is held open in the middle ground. In the blurred background, professional kitchen equipment, including a silver stand mixer and a yellow cup, rests on a counter. A second person, partially visible in a red and blue jacket, is positioned next to the bag.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To the right middle ground, a woman in a blue jacket stands with her hands in her pockets, looking down at the dog. In the background, a large window spans the left and center, showing a cityscape outside. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, angling downward. During the shot, the dog moves from the center toward the bottom right, nudging the tennis ball, while the woman steps forward, remaining on the right side of the frame. No significant changes in shot size occur.",
