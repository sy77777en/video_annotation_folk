    "pre_caption": "The video starts from a first-person perspective, with a dark vertical structure in the left foreground partially obscuring the view. To the right, an enemy vehicle is in the middle ground, right of center, with trees and a damaged building in the middle ground and background, also right of center. An \"ARMED\" objective marker is in the middle ground, right of center. The view then shifts, moving forward and right, to behind a mounted machine gun, which becomes the central foreground element. An enemy soldier enters from the right and runs left across the middle ground, center, in front of a low wall, with a building in the background, center, and vegetation in the surrounding middle ground and background. The machine gun fires, and the enemy soldier falls in the middle ground, center, while on-screen text appears in the bottom center foreground. The camera maintains the character's eye-level perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A soldier, initially taking cover behind a building, engages in a war-torn, tropical environment. In the near distance, an enemy vehicle is visible amidst rubble and trees, with a damaged building further back. The soldier then takes control of a machine gun, aims at an enemy combatant running past a low wall, and fires. The enemy soldier is hit and falls to the ground, with on-screen text confirming the kill. The action unfolds in an outdoor setting with scattered debris and vegetation, under an objective labeled \"ARMED.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, immerses the viewer in an outdoor, tropical environment during the daytime. The setting features light-colored, simple concrete or stucco buildings, some appearing damaged, interspersed with lush green vegetation, including palm trees and bushes. The ground consists of dirt, sand, and scattered rubble. In the background, a dark, metallic, and angular wrecked military vehicle is visible. The scene depicts movement as the viewpoint shifts, and includes the action of aiming and firing a weapon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

To the left, a group of people stands near a row of bicycles in the middle ground, while a food cart is visible in the background, right of center. A digital map overlay appears in the top right corner. The camera then pans right and tilts slightly upward, revealing a statue on a pedestal that becomes the central element in the upper middle ground. A dog enters from the left and moves toward the fountain, remaining in the foreground, while a child runs from the bottom right to the center, passing behind the dog. The camera remains at a low angle, below the subjects’ eye level, throughout the sequence.",
