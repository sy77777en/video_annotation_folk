    "pre_caption": "The video is a full shot. A large soccer ball is framed in the left middle ground. To its right and slightly further back in the middle ground, two men are running, with the man in white positioned to the left of the man in red. All three subjects are in motion, moving generally from left to right across the scene and also slightly towards the foreground. The green soccer field occupies the foreground and middle ground at the bottom of the frame. The background consists of white and black checkered walls across the top, with blue geometric shapes visible on the right. The camera is at the subjects' height and tracks their movement, maintaining the ball on the left side of the frame and the men to its right as they advance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, classic black-and-white paneled soccer ball, featuring a small green and yellow emblem on one white panel, is positioned to the left in the midground. To its right back, two men in athletic attire are running. The first man has white, medium-length hair and wears a white jersey with black trim and the number \"7\" in black on the chest, over a black and blue striped long-sleeved undershirt, with white shorts and black shoes with white laces. The second man has black spiky hair with an undercut and wears a red jersey with black trim and the number \"18\" in black on the chest, over a black long-sleeved undershirt, with red shorts and white shoes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors on a bright green soccer grassland. The background features white and black checkered walls, with some blue geometric shapes visible. A large, classic black and white soccer ball, marked with a small green and yellow logo, rolls across the green surface. Two figures, one in a white and black uniform with the number 7 and another in a red and black uniform with the number 18, are running alongside the ball.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",

She is positioned in the foreground, while a small brown dog sits to her left, closer to the bottom left corner of the frame and also in the foreground. Behind them, a row of red bicycles is lined up along the middle ground, stretching from the right edge toward the center. The background consists of a mural with green and orange abstract patterns covering the top half of the frame. The camera is positioned at the woman’s eye level, maintaining a steady height throughout the scene, with no significant movement or changes in shot size.",
