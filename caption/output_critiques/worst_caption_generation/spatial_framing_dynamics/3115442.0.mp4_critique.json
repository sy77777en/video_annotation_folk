    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the lower half of a person walking. The subject occupies the center of the frame, with their legs and feet prominently displayed. The person's feet move forward from the bottom center towards the center of the frame, indicating a steady pace. The dress, which extends down to the ankles, sways slightly with each step. The patterned tile floor, featuring geometric designs in various colors, serves as the background and fills the entire frame beneath the subject. The camera maintains a consistent level with the subject's feet throughout the sequence, capturing the movement from a frontal perspective. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the subject remains centrally framed while walking. The camera height is at the subject's level, ensuring a direct view of the walking motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with a warm, medium-brown skin tone wearing a long, flowing yellow dress with a floral pattern. The focus is on their legs and feet as they walk across a patterned tile floor. The person is wearing brown, strappy sandals. The dress moves slightly with each step, emphasizing the motion of walking. The scene captures the elegance and detail of the dress and footwear against the intricate geometric design of the floor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor setting with a patterned tile floor featuring a geometric design in shades of black, white, green, and earthy yellow. The environment is likely a spacious hall or corridor, characterized by its intricate flooring. The lighting suggests it is well-lit, possibly during the day or under artificial lighting. A person wearing a yellow floral dress and brown sandals walks across the tiles, adding movement to the scene. The focus remains on the floor's detailed pattern and the gentle motion of the person's steps, creating a harmonious blend of color and texture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a medium shot of two people seated at a table, positioned side by side in the center of the frame. Both subjects are visible from the waist up, facing slightly toward the left side of the frame. The table, covered with a plain white tablecloth, occupies the lower third of the image in the foreground, while a large window with closed blinds fills the background across the top half of the frame. The camera is set at eye level with the seated subjects, providing a straight-on perspective. Throughout the video, the subjects remain stationary, with no significant changes in their spatial position or shot size. The lighting is even, and no other elements move or enter the frame during the sequence.",
