    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot at the subjects' level, showing a man in a leather jacket on the right, a man in a suit in the center, and a man with long hair on the left, all positioned in the middle ground. The camera then pans left and pulls back as another man in a hoodie moves through the left foreground. The camera angle shifts to an overhead position, revealing two women sitting in a booth in the middle ground—one with glasses on the left and one with a beanie on the right. The shot continues to pull back from this high angle, repositioning the man in the leather jacket to the left and the man in the suit to the center-background, while the two women are now in the right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A fair-skinned man with short brown hair, wearing a black leather jacket over a collared shirt and tie with a badge on a chain, sits on the right, gesturing with one hand while holding a foamy glass of beer. Next to him stands a taller, fair-skinned man with curly brown hair and glasses, dressed in a brown suit, a white shirt, and a striped tie. To the left, another man with long dark hair and a beard, wearing a patterned jacket over a green shirt, drinks from a green bottle. In a booth, a woman with long blonde hair and a black beanie sits next to a woman with dark hair, glasses, and tattoos on her arm; both hold drinks. Other people, including a man with a grey beard and another man in a white shirt, are visible in the background, laughing and socializing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night inside a dimly lit bar with dark wood-paneled walls. People are gathered in booths that have green upholstered benches. The space is illuminated by warm, yellow light, including a small, green-shaded lamp over one of the tables. A framed picture hangs on the wall. Patrons hold beer bottles and glasses, with one glass overflowing with foam. In one booth, a small bowl of snacks is visible on the table. The camera moves through the space, revealing more of the patrons as small, yellow, cube-shaped objects are tossed into the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot from a low angle, capturing a single woman in a red dress standing in the center background, flanked by two large potted plants on the left and right edges of the frame in the foreground. The camera slowly dollies forward, reducing the shot to a medium close-up of the woman, who remains centered while the plants move out of view. As the camera continues to advance, a child on a bicycle enters from the bottom right foreground and rides diagonally toward the top left background, passing behind the woman. The camera then tilts upward, shifting to a high angle that reveals a glass ceiling above, with sunlight streaming in from the top left. In this final segment, the woman is now positioned in the bottom center of the frame, while the child is visible in the top right background, and the potted plants are no longer in view.",
