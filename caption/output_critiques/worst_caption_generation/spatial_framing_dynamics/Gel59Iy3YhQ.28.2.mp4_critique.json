    "pre_caption": "The scene is a first-person view focused on a large, white block structure that occupies the center, top, and right portions of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. A small game avatar is visible in the top left corner, appearing in the background relative to the construction. User interface elements are overlaid in the foreground: a hotbar at the bottom center, control prompts in the bottom right, an inventory prompt in the bottom left, and a crosshair in the center. The camera, positioned below the main structure and looking upwards, pans slightly to the right and tilts upwards. This movement shifts the view of the central structure, causing the crosshair to move from a lower block to a higher one, and brings more of a stepped block formation on the right side of the structure into view. The background shows a blue sky with clouds and a distant landscape far below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a first-person perspective within a block-based game, centered on a large, partially built structure made of smooth, white, cubic blocks. This structure includes a series of stepped white blocks extending to the right, suggesting a curved wall or staircase. In the top left corner, a small, pixelated game avatar with light skin, orange hair, a light green top, and dark pants is visible, facing the main construction. The game's interface is overlaid, including a hotbar at the bottom displaying various colored blocks—white, light blue, dark blue, red, black—and a red flower-like item, with the white block currently selected. On the right side of the screen, control prompts for \"ZL Place,\" \"ZR Mine,\" \"Y Drop,\" and \"X Emote\" are displayed next to their respective button icons. A small, light gray plus-shaped crosshair is positioned in the center of the view, aimed at the white block structure. Additionally, there is an overlaid icon and prompt for \"Inventory\" in the bottom-left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a Minecraft world during the daytime under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. The view is from high up, looking at a large, partially constructed white block structure. The structure, made of smooth white blocks, extends upwards and outwards, with the player seemingly adding to it. In the distance, a faint landscape of green and brown is visible far below. A character model can be seen in the upper left corner of the view. Overlay elements are present: in the bottom left, an \"X Inventory\" label is next to an inventory bar displaying various colored blocks, with a white block currently selected. In the bottom right, controller button prompts for \"ZL Place\", \"ZR Mine\", \"Y Drop\", and \"B Emote\" are visible. A small grey crosshair is centered on the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
