    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man, capturing him from the chest up. Initially, he is positioned slightly off-center to the right in the frame, with his head turned towards the left. The folder he holds is in the foreground, closer to the bottom left of the frame. As he opens the folder, his hands move slightly, bringing the folder into clearer view in the middle ground. After examining the contents, he shifts his gaze upward and places the folder at the top left corner of the frame, moving it from the foreground to the background. The man remains in the same general area throughout the sequence, with the camera maintaining a steady position at his eye level. The background consists of dimly lit, indistinct shapes, suggesting a confined indoor space. The lighting emphasizes the man and the folder while keeping the background subdued. There are no significant changes in the camera angle or height during the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium skin tone and short dark hair, who has a beard and mustache. He is wearing a dark leather jacket and is seen holding a folder-like item, which he opens to view its contents. His expression is focused as he examines the folder briefly. After inspecting it, he looks up and places the folder at the top left of the frame. The lighting casts shadows on his face, highlighting his features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with dim, moody lighting, creating a shadowy atmosphere. The environment appears to be a confined space, possibly a room with dark walls. The time of day is indeterminate due to the low light, but the scene suggests an evening or nighttime setting. Notable visual elements include a person holding an object, possibly food, with a focused expression. The person is wearing a dark leather jacket, adding to the subdued color palette. The lighting casts soft shadows, highlighting the texture of the jacket and the person's features. The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet introspection within a confined, dimly lit space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a woman seated at a desk, visible from the waist up. She is positioned in the center of the frame, facing directly toward the camera, with a laptop placed in the foreground at the bottom center. To her right, a potted plant sits on the edge of the desk, occupying the bottom right of the frame in the foreground. In the background, a large window spans the top left to top center, allowing natural light to illuminate the scene. The woman occasionally glances down at her phone, which rests on the desk to her left, before returning her gaze to the camera. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at a slightly elevated angle above the woman’s eye level, looking down at her. There are no significant changes in shot size or subject position, and the background remains consistently visible behind her.",
