    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle above the ice, initially frames a hockey player in a gold and black uniform in the lower-left foreground, skating toward the right. In the background, a player in a dark blue and red uniform is at the top left, while another player is at the top right. The camera pans right, following the play as the player in the dark blue and red uniform skates from the background to the center of the frame, gaining possession of the puck. Consequently, the player who was in the foreground moves to the left middle ground, and another player in a dark blue and red uniform enters from the right background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures two hockey teams actively engaged in gameplay on the ice rink. Players from both teams, wearing contrasting uniforms of dark blue and red, and gold and black, are seen passing the puck among themselves. The action is dynamic, with players skating swiftly across the ice. In the middle ground, a referee is visible, dressed in a black and white striped shirt and black pants, overseeing the game.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an indoor ice hockey rink, captured from an elevated, overhead perspective that provides a wide view of the action. The vast expanse of white ice is marked with thin red lines, a thicker blue line, and a large, faint grey logo at its center. Surrounding the playing surface are white boards topped with clear panels. Several players are in motion across the ice, some wearing dark jerseys with red and white details and others in gold and black uniforms. A figure in a black and white striped jersey is also present. The players, equipped with hockey sticks, skate swiftly across the rink, maneuvering around a small black puck.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The camera remains stationary as the figure slowly bends down to pick up a small white towel from the floor.
