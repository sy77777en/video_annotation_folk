    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of a residential neighborhood, showcasing a narrow street flanked by houses. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective. Initially, a blue house occupies the right side of the frame, positioned in the foreground. A wooden fence runs along the left side, extending into the middle ground. As the camera moves forward, the blue house gradually shifts towards the right edge of the frame, eventually exiting the view. In its place, a distinctively textured building with a white gable comes into focus in the center-right of the frame, situated in the middle ground. This building remains prominent as the camera continues to advance. On the left side, the wooden fence persists, accompanied by lush greenery. The road curves gently, leading the viewer's eye deeper into the scene. Overhead, power lines crisscross the clear blue sky, spanning from the top left to the top right of the frame. The camera maintains a steady pace, smoothly transitioning between different sections of the street while keeping the overall composition balanced. The spatial dynamics highlight the orderly layout of the neighborhood, with houses and greenery evenly distributed along the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a neighborhood scenery shot. It captures a quiet residential street with a focus on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject. The scene features a narrow road flanked by houses, including a blue house and a distinctively textured building with a white gable. The presence of lush green trees and neatly trimmed bushes adds to the serene ambiance. Overhead, numerous power lines crisscross the clear blue sky, contributing to the sense of scale and everyday life. The emphasis is on the overall setting, highlighting the peaceful and orderly nature of the neighborhood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, capturing a serene outdoor setting in a small residential area. The scene unfolds on a clear, sunny day, with a bright blue sky overhead. The narrow street is flanked by modest houses, with a notable blue house and a traditional wooden building with a distinct tiled pattern both situated on the right side of the road. The road is paved and clean, bordered by a low stone wall and a wooden fence. Lush green trees and neatly trimmed bushes add a touch of nature to the environment. Overhead, utility wires stretch across the sky, contributing to the suburban atmosphere. The overall scene is calm and orderly, with no visible movement or activity, emphasizing the quietness of the neighborhood.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a bustling outdoor café, with several round tables filling the foreground and middle ground across the center and left side of the frame. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, angling downward to capture the tops of the tables and the people seated around them. In the initial moments, a waiter in a red uniform stands at the bottom right foreground, moving toward the center as the camera slowly pans left. A large fountain occupies the background, stretching from the top left to the top center of the frame, with water visibly spraying upward. On the right side, a row of bicycles is parked along a metal railing in the middle ground. As the camera continues to pan, a group of musicians enters from the left edge, settling near the bottom left foreground, their instruments partially visible. The camera maintains a steady, elevated perspective throughout, allowing for a clear view of the café’s layout and the interactions among patrons and staff. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the lively atmosphere, with tables, people, and decorative elements distributed evenly across the scene.",
