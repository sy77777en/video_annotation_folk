    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' leg level. Initially, the lower body of a skater (Skater 1), wearing black leggings with white stripes and a dark top, is visible standing in a doorway located on the center-right of the frame, in the middle ground. The white ice surface occupies the foreground and extends into the background, bordered on the right by light-colored rink boards containing the doorway. A second skater (Skater 2), wearing black leggings and a top with a light-colored central panel, emerges from this center-right, middle-ground doorway, skates diagonally towards the left foreground, and then exits the frame on the left. Subsequently, a third skater (Skater 3), dressed in an all-black outfit, follows a similar path, emerging from the same center-right, middle-ground doorway, skating towards the left foreground, and exiting to the left. Finally, Skater 1 (with the striped leggings) moves from the doorway, skating towards the left and deeper into the middle ground of the rink, transitioning from their initial center-right position towards the center-left of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows the lower bodies of four individuals on an ice rink, all wearing white figure skates. The first individual, initially positioned in a doorway, wears black leggings with three thin white vertical stripes on each outer leg and a dark blue and black top. A second individual, wearing black leggings and a black long-sleeved top, enters the ice rink from the center gate and skates toward the left across the scene. A third individual, dressed in black leggings without stripes and a light grey top, skates out from the same doorway. The fourth skater, wearing all black, follows. Finally, the first skater moves after the other three, skating leftward further into the rink.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an indoor ice skating rink, with the camera positioned low, offering a view across the white, reflective ice surface marked with skate lines. To the right, the rink boards are light-colored with a lower yellow band, featuring an ice rink gate from which skaters emerge. In the background, the far wall of the rink displays small, rectangular windows high up, and a transparent barrier is visible above the rink boards. The ceiling reveals a structure of metal trusses and lighting fixtures. Skaters in dark leggings and white ice skates are seen moving on the ice.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

At the start, a person wearing a bright red jacket and blue jeans stands near the bottom left of the frame in the foreground, holding a large yellow umbrella. To the right, a small brown dog sits in the middle ground, positioned at the center of the frame. In the background, a row of green park benches lines the top right edge of the frame. The person slowly walks from the bottom left toward the center, passing behind the dog, while the dog remains stationary. As the person reaches the center, they pause and open the umbrella, which partially obscures the benches in the background. No other subjects enter or exit the frame, and the camera remains at a consistent height throughout the scene.",
