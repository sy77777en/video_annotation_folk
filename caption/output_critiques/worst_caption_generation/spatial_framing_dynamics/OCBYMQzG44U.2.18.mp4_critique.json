    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the entire room, with the camera positioned at water level, creating a split view of the water’s surface and the space above. The tiled walls and ceiling fill most of the frame, with the row of ceiling lights extending from the top center toward the background, emphasizing the room’s depth. On the left side of the frame in the background, a dark, arched opening is partially submerged, its top just above the waterline, while the rest of the opening recedes into darkness. In the background, slightly right of center, a set of white steps leads up to a raised platform and a tall, featureless doorway, both positioned in the middle ground to background. The water occupies the lower half of the frame in the foreground, with gentle ripples visible. The camera remains at a low, level angle throughout, matching the height of the water’s surface and maintaining a consistent perspective on the room’s spatial layout. There are no major changes in shot size or spatial position during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a liminal space scenery shot, capturing an eerie and sterile environment. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere of the location rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and unease. The scene is a large, rectangular room with walls covered in small, white grid tiles, illuminated by a row of bright, square ceiling lights. This clean, institutional setting is starkly contrasted by the dark, murky water that floods the lower half of the room, with the camera positioned at water level to give an immersive, level-angle perspective. On the left, the top of a dark, arched opening emerges from the gently rippling surface of the water in the back wall, with its interior shrouded in complete darkness. In the background, a set of white steps leads up to a raised platform and a tall, featureless doorway, adding to the enigmatic quality of the space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an indoor environment resembling a large, empty pool room with white tiled walls and ceiling. The water level is high, with the viewer’s perspective partially submerged, creating a split view of the water’s surface and the space above. Overhead, a row of rectangular ceiling lights casts a bright, even illumination across the room, reflecting off the glossy tiles. At one end of the pool, a dark circular opening is visible on the wall, contrasting sharply with the otherwise pale surroundings. The water appears calm, with gentle ripples and a slightly reflective surface. The overall scene is minimalistic, with clean lines and a monochromatic color palette dominated by white and muted tones. No overlays, text, or additional visual elements are present.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject is placed in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground, while the window stretches across the background from left to right. To the right of the subject, a tall bookshelf filled with colorful books is visible in the middle ground, reaching from the bottom right to the top right of the frame. On the left side, a small potted plant sits on a table in the foreground, its leaves extending toward the bottom left corner. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent downward angle on the subject and the surrounding elements.
