    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot of a dimly lit room. The scene opens with a close-up shot, where a photograph of intertwined hands hangs in the center middle ground from a wire stretched across the top of the frame. A string of red lights is positioned in the foreground at the top, while a table occupies the bottom foreground. The camera then slowly pulls back, transitioning to a wide shot that reveals more of the environment. In the final framing, a piece of furniture covered by a white sheet is visible in the center-left middle ground, with a narrow hallway appearing in the right background. A lamp on a table is now seen in the bottom left foreground. The camera remains at a straight-on, eye-level height throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the interior of a dimly lit, narrow attic or storage space, creating a moody and mysterious atmosphere. The room is enveloped in an eerie red glow from a string of lights across the wooden-slatted ceiling, complemented by a prominent red lamp. A single bulb on the side of the hallway emits a contrasting white glow, adding to the ambiance. The dark, horizontal wooden panels of the walls and ceiling enhance the claustrophobic feel. A painting depicting two figures from behind hangs from a string, while a piece of furniture is shrouded under a white sheet. Nearby, a table with a lamp adds to the scene. The focus is on establishing the environment's atmosphere, with the collection of objects and oppressive lighting telling a story about the space itself rather than highlighting a specific character or item.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with walls and a ceiling made of horizontal wooden slats, a black and white photograph of two intertwined hands hangs from a wire by a binder clip. The scene is cast in a red hue from a string of small red bulbs. As the view slightly pulls back and then pans left, it reveals more of the space, including a piece of furniture draped in a white sheet and a narrow hallway in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",

  "bad_caption": "This video begins with a medium shot of a person seated at a desk, positioned in the center foreground of the frame. A large window occupies the top left background, letting in bright daylight. To the right, a tall bookshelf stands in the middle ground, partially obscured by a potted plant in the bottom right foreground. The camera slowly tilts upward, shifting to a high-angle view that looks down on the subject and reveals a ceiling fan spinning in the top center background. As the camera movement continues, the subject stands and moves toward the left edge of the frame, while a cat enters from the bottom left foreground and sits near the desk. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a position above the subjects, capturing the scene from a slightly elevated perspective.",
