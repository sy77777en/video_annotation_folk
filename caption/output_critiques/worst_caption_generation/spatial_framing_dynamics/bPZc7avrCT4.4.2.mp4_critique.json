    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up, low-angle shot of a golf scene on a green lawn. In the middle ground, the lower legs of a person stand on the left side of the frame. In the foreground, a large pink ball is positioned on the right, with a small white golf ball just to its left in the center. The head of a golf driver, held by the person, swings from the left across the center of the frame, striking the pink ball. Upon impact, the pink ball bursts, and a large splash of white liquid erupts outwards from its position on the right. The small white golf ball is propelled forward and to the right through the splash, while the remnants of the pink ball collapse onto the grass. The camera remains static and level with the balls on the ground throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The lower legs and feet of a light-skinned person wearing white athletic shoes are visible on a green lawn. The person is holding a golf driver with a black head, a green and yellow design, and a white shaft. On the grass in front of the person are two objects: a small, standard white golf ball and a much larger, smooth, bright pink ball. The golf club swings and strikes the large pink ball, which immediately bursts, creating a large splash of white, foamy liquid that erupts outwards. The small white golf ball is propelled through the large pink ball as it bursts from the impact.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a manicured green lawn, a golf club is positioned near a large, pink, water-filled balloon and a standard white golf ball. The club swings downward in slow motion, striking the pink balloon, which bursts and sends a large splash of clear water across the grass. In the middleground, the lower legs of a person wearing white sneakers are visible, providing visual balance, with a blurred fence in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

As a summary of that specifically:\n- Parts of the lawn are in the foreground. \n- The golf ball and balloon are in the middleground. \n- The legs of the person are also in the middleground. NOT THE BACKGROUND.\n- A fence is further in the background. \n\n2. The shot is not entirely static; there is a very subtle shake at the very end of the video.\n\n3.

The remnants do not collapse onto the grass. Rather, they are pushed on the golf club, and exit the frame to the right. \n\n5. The club strikes the golf ball first, then the balloon. Change the order of the description, as currently it sounds like it hits the balloon first. ",

In the middle ground, a wicker basket sits near the center of the frame, with a glass pitcher of lemonade and a stack of sandwiches arranged to its right. A pair of sunglasses rests on the left edge of the blanket. Two people are seated cross-legged behind the basket, facing each other, with their upper bodies visible. One person, positioned slightly to the right, reaches forward to pour lemonade into a cup, while the other, on the left, holds a sandwich. In the background, gentle ocean waves are visible, stretching across the top of the frame. The camera remains at the same height as the seated people throughout, with no noticeable movement or shake.",
