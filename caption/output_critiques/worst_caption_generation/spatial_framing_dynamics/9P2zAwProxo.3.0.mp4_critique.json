    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium selfie POV shot, positioning a person from the thighs up on the right side of the frame, while the snowy ground and background trees occupy the left. The camera, initially held at the subject's level, falls backward with the person, causing the frame to shake and tilt as it drops toward the ground. This movement shifts the perspective, and the person moves out of the frame. The shot settles into a low-angle view from the ground, where a black selfie stick is positioned in the center foreground, extending from the bottom of the frame. In the top right middle ground, a portion of a board with a person's foot on it is visible, with the rest of the scene filled by the snowy ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a person seen from the thighs up, wearing a black varsity-style jacket with long white sleeves. A white vertical stripe is visible on the right side of their waist. As the person falls, a brown circular patch on the jacket becomes visible. The focus then shifts to objects on the snowy ground. In the foreground, a long, black, cylindrical selfie stick is visible, with a black \"Travel Feed\" logo in a script font overlaid on the video. Nearby, a board with a white and beige surface is seen, with a person's foot in a black shoe or boot resting on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a selfie POV shot, the scene is set in a snow-covered outdoor area during the day. The white snow blankets the ground, dotted with a few small twigs, while the bare trunks of trees are visible in the background, suggesting a winter forest. A person wearing a black jacket with a white sleeve is seen as the camera begins at eye level and then drops to the ground as they fall backward into the snow, causing the camera to shake during the descent. A black, cursive text overlay reading \"Travel Feed\" appears near the center of the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera adopts a selfie POV perspective. At first, it captures a medium shot of a person. As the person falls, the camera follows the motion but loses the subject, eventually shifting to a scene showing snowy ground, a selfie stick, and part of a skateboard with the person’s foot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",

The pair are positioned in the middle ground, with a large lake stretching across the background and a row of benches visible along the bottom left foreground. The camera is set at eye level with the subjects. As the video progresses, the camera slowly pans to the left, bringing a tall lamppost into the right side of the frame while the two people remain in the center. The shot size remains wide throughout, and there are no significant changes in the height or depth of the camera relative to the subjects. No major spatial transitions or movements of the subjects occur during the video.",
