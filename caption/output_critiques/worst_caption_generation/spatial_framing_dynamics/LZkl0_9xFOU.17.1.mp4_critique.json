    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a mannequin-like figure is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To the right, the front of a car occupies the foreground. In the middle ground to the left, green trash bins are visible, with a yellow bollard positioned in front of them at the bottom left. A yellow line on the ground extends diagonally from the bottom left toward the center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A faceless, mannequin-like figure with pale, artificial-looking skin and short, dark hair is depicted in a running pose. The figure wears a brightly colored, short-sleeved tie-dye t-shirt featuring swirls of blue, green, yellow, and purple, along with blue jeans. Its arms are bent with clenched fists, suggesting motion. To the right of the figure, the front passenger side of a dark-colored car is partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night on a paved surface, possibly a road or parking lot, marked with a yellow line. On the right, the front of a dark car is visible. To the left, there are green trash bins and a yellow bollard. The environment is cast in a cool, bluish light, and the background is blurred, indicating motion. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, reading \"[10].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
