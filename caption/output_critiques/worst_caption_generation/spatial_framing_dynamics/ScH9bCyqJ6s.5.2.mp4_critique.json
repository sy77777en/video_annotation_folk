    "pre_caption": "An extreme close-up shot, filmed from directly above, centers on a pair of hands in the foreground holding a small electronic component. The component is held in the middle of the frame, with a blurred background of other disassembled parts. The right thumb, positioned on the right side of the component, moves slightly to reveal a grid of perforations on a metal plate.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds a small, intricate electronic component. The component consists of two metal plates connected by a black plastic frame. One metal plate has a small, etched QR code and a grid of circular perforations on one side. Through cutouts in the second metal plate, a small blue square component and a silver-colored square component with a white center are visible. The hands are holding the object between their thumbs and index fingers, with the right thumb partially covering the perforated section of the first metal plate.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot shows a pair of hands holding a small, rectangular electronic component against a blurred background of other disassembled parts. The component consists of two metal plates secured by a black frame. The first plate has a grid of circular perforations on one side and an etched, square-shaped code on the other. A small, bright blue square is visible on the second metal plate. The hands hold the object steady, with a thumb resting near the perforated section.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
