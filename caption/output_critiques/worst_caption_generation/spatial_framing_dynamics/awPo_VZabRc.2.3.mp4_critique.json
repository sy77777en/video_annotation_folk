    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, where an animated man is initially a small figure in the top center background, running down a narrow alleyway towards the camera. The alleyway's right brick wall occupies the right side of the frame, and the left wall with windows is on the left, both extending from foreground to background. Through the left windows, a parking area is visible in the middle ground. As the man runs forward, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, with the man now in the center foreground. The alley walls shift to the middle ground on the left and right, and the alley's opening, revealing distant city buildings against a pale sky, becomes visible in the center background. The camera, initially positioned above the subject, changes to be at the subject's level by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated man with black, spiky hair. He is depicted wearing a white shirt under a black, open jacket that has a cape-like quality, flaring out behind him. His attire is completed with grey, slim-fitting pants and black shoes. The character's design is stylized, with notably thin limbs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, observed from an objective viewpoint, shows a figure running through a narrow, dimly lit alleyway. The ground is a dark, paved surface. To the right is a reddish-brown brick wall, and to the left, a dark gray wall with multiple rectangular windows. Through these windows, a green-tinged parking area with white painted lines is visible. The alley opens up to a view of distant city buildings silhouetted against a pale orange and light blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing an animated woman standing in the bottom right foreground, facing a large fountain that occupies the center background. To the left of the frame, a row of tall trees stretches from the foreground to the background, partially obscuring a playground visible in the middle ground. The woman is positioned slightly below the camera’s height, which is angled downward. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly pans left, bringing the playground into the center of the frame and shifting the woman to the bottom left foreground. The fountain remains in the background, while the trees now line the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The camera maintains its elevated position relative to the subjects throughout the shot.",
