    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man on a skateboard is initially positioned in the center foreground. He pushes off and moves from the right side of the frame toward the left, remaining in the foreground as he crouches down. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, pans left to follow his movement. In the middle ground, a street is visible on the left, while a building and palm trees occupy the right. As the man skates past, a yellow fire hydrant enters the frame in the bottom right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light brown skin tone and tattoos on his left arm is skateboarding on a sidewalk. He is wearing a white tank top, black pants, and white socks pulled up his calves. On his feet are black and white sneakers. In some views, he also wears a black beanie. He is shown in various dynamic poses, bending his knees and leaning forward as he rides his skateboard, which has a dark-colored deck and light, metallic-looking trucks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Filmed from a low angle, the scene unfolds on a concrete sidewalk in a sunny, urban setting, capturing a full shot of a man on a skateboard. Adjacent to the sidewalk is a street with a car in the distance. The primary architectural feature is a modern building with a gray lower wall and an upper facade of vertical fins. A sign on the building reads \"HOLLYWOOD BILTMORE,\" and the address \"1745\" is displayed in lettering attached to a low wall facing the street. The environment is populated with tall palm trees, green shrubbery, and a cactus. A yellow fire hydrant is positioned on a corner of the sidewalk. The scene is captured during the daytime under a bright, slightly hazy sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

She faces left, and the camera is positioned slightly above her eye level, angling down. In the background, a row of parked bicycles lines the left side of the frame, while a fountain is visible in the top center. As the woman turns to her left, the camera slowly pans left, keeping her in the right third of the frame. A small dog briefly enters the bottom left foreground before exiting. No significant changes in shot size occur throughout the scene.",
