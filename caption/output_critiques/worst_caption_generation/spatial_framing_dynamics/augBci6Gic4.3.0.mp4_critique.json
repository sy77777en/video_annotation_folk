    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman in profile, occupying the foreground on the left side of the frame. In the middle ground, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and is out of focus. The focus then shifts from the woman in the foreground to the man in the middle ground, bringing him into sharp focus for a close-up shot while the woman becomes blurred. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up profile of an older woman with fair skin and long brown hair, who is smiling while speaking. In the middleground, an older man is visible but out of focus. The focus then shifts from the woman to the man, bringing him into sharp detail. He has fair skin, graying hair, and a gray goatee. He is wearing a gray collared shirt over a lighter gray t-shirt and is looking toward the woman with a slight smile.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting against a solid black, featureless background, a woman is positioned in the foreground, seen in profile. A man with graying hair and a goatee is visible in the middleground behind her. The scene is illuminated by soft lighting, possibly from multiple sources. The camera's focus transitions from the woman in the foreground to the man in the middleground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a young boy standing in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. To his right in the background, a large window is visible, letting in natural light. On the left side of the frame in the foreground, a small table with a vase of flowers is partially visible. The camera is positioned slightly above the boy’s eye level, looking down at him. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly pans to the right, bringing the window and the outdoor scenery into the center of the frame while the boy and the table move out of view to the left. The shot size and camera height remain consistent throughout the video.",
