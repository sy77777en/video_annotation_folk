    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot of a night sky, focusing on the atmospheric phenomenon of an aurora. The faint green light of the aurora is positioned in the upper right, occupying the background. In the lower left, the silhouette of a tree is visible in the foreground, while a structure with a string of lights is slightly below and to the left, also in the foreground. A small, bright blue light briefly appears in the lower right, positioned in the foreground. The camera is at a height that captures the vastness of the sky, with slight movement throughout, maintaining the focus on the aurora and the surrounding elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a night sky scenery shot, where the primary focus is on the atmospheric phenomenon rather than a distinct subject. Against an almost completely black sky, a faint, diffuse, and elongated patch of green light, characteristic of an aurora, is visible. In the lower left corner, the dark silhouette of what appears to be a tree is faintly discernible. Below this and slightly to the left, a small structure with a brightly lit roofline, adorned with a string of lights, can be seen. A tiny, bright blue light briefly appears in the lower right portion of the frame. The overall composition emphasizes the vastness of the dark sky and the subtle beauty of the aurora, making the environment itself the central element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person perspective, shows a very dark night sky. A faint, diffuse greenish light, resembling an aurora, is visible in the upper right portion of the sky, appearing to shimmer or shift subtly. In the lower left, the dark silhouette of a bare tree is discernible. Further down and to the left, a structure with a string of warm yellow lights along its roofline is partially visible. A tiny, bright blue light can be seen near the bottom right. The camera exhibits slight movement throughout the clip.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a person seated at a wooden desk, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. To the left in the middle ground, a large open book is visible, while a small potted plant sits on the right edge of the desk in the foreground. Behind the main subject, a window spans the background, showing a cityscape with several tall buildings illuminated by daylight. The camera is set at eye level with the seated person, and there is a slow pan from left to right, gradually revealing more of the desk and the objects on it. Throughout the video, the spatial arrangement remains consistent, with only the camera’s horizontal movement altering the visible elements within the frame.",
