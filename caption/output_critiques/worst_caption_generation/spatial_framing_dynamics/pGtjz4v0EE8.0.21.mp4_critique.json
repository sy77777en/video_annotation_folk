    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, the Fountain of Neptune is positioned in the center of the frame, with a crowd of people occupying the foreground at the bottom and historic buildings in the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, pans from left to right in an arc around the monument. As the camera moves, the large white marble statue remains the central focus, while the background architecture shifts, with the prominent stone facade of a building moving from the right side of the frame to a position directly behind the fountain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video's main subject is a monumental white marble statue of a nude, muscular man, Neptune, standing in the center of an ornate fountain. The statue is crowned, has a beard, and looks down and to its left while holding a staff-like object in its right hand. At the base of this central figure are several smaller, bronze-colored statues of sea horses and other mythological figures. A large crowd of people, consisting of men and women in casual summer clothing such as t-shirts, is gathered around the fountain, observing the artwork on a sunny day. The fountain is situated in a public square surrounded by historic, multi-story stone and stucco buildings under a clear blue sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit public square in Florence, Italy, the ornate Fountain of Neptune stands as the central feature. The fountain showcases a large, white marble statue of a crowned, nude male figure at its apex, surrounded by smaller bronze sculptures of mythical figures and sea horses at its base, from which water spouts. The square is enclosed by historic, multi-story buildings constructed from tan and brown stone and stucco, with the prominent stone facade of the Palazzo Vecchio visible in the background against a clear, deep blue sky. A crowd of people is gathered around the fountain, and the camera pans around the monument, providing various views of the sculpture and the surrounding architecture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "In a medium shot, a large bronze equestrian statue is positioned on the left side of the frame, with a group of street musicians seated in the middle ground near the bottom right. The background features a row of modern glass buildings stretching across the top of the frame. The camera, placed slightly above the subjects, tilts downward as it slowly zooms in on the musicians, bringing them into the center of the frame while the statue shifts out of view to the far left. Throughout the movement, the musicians remain at the camera’s lower angle, and the glass buildings in the background become less prominent as the shot tightens.",
