    "pre_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a lush, mountainous landscape. The dense forest of evergreen trees occupies the foreground and middle ground, stretching across the bottom and center of the frame. The mountain peaks, partially shrouded in mist, are positioned in the middle ground and background, extending from the left to the center. The sky, with its partly cloudy appearance, forms the background, occupying the top portion of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high elevation, captures the scene from above, emphasizing the vastness and scale of the landscape. The drone's movement provides a sweeping view, maintaining a consistent framing of the expansive environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast expanse of lush, green forested mountains under a bright, partly cloudy sky. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the dense tree coverage and the mist gently rolling over the mountain peaks. The emphasis is on the natural beauty and scale of the landscape, rather than any specific object, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and grandeur.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures a sweeping view of a lush, mountainous landscape during the day. The scene is set outdoors, showcasing a dense forest of evergreen trees covering the rolling hills. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible through the white clouds. Mist gently drifts over the mountain peaks, adding a dynamic element to the serene environment. The vibrant green of the trees contrasts with the soft white clouds, creating a picturesque natural setting. The drone's perspective provides a broad, elevated view, emphasizing the vastness and tranquility of the forested mountains.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject faces the camera directly, with their upper body and head clearly visible. To the left of the subject, a small potted plant sits on the desk, occupying the bottom left foreground. Behind the subject, a large window fills the background, stretching from the left to the right edge of the frame and revealing a city skyline in the distance. The camera is placed at the subject’s eye level, maintaining a steady, frontal perspective throughout the scene. No significant movement occurs, and the spatial arrangement of the elements remains consistent for the duration of the video.",
