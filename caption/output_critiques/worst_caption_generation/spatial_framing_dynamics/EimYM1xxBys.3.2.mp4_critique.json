The camera then pulls back and tilts, bringing the scene into focus to reveal a wide shot. In the final composition, an armored figure stands in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground, while a second person lies on the walkway to the right of the figure. A small vehicle is positioned in the left middle ground, with a large solar panel behind it. The IGN logo remains in the bottom right corner throughout the shot.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a blurry, level-angle, upside-down view of a long, grated metal walkway in a dark, futuristic setting. As the camera moves, rotates and comes into focus, it reveals a figure in bulky, dark robotic armor with yellow accents and a glowing red visor, identified by on-screen text as \"PCPD Cop 02.\" This armored figure stands next to a second person, who is initially seen kneeling before lying face down on the walkway, dressed in reddish-brown clothing. A speech bubble appears above the armored figure. Below is overlay text, \"Got you now, you piece of shit.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night on a high, outdoor industrial walkway made of dark metal grating that extends into a hazy, blue-green fog. The environment is filled with large, dark structures, including a small vehicle and a large solar panel prominently positioned in the middle ground, with thick wires and cables hanging overhead. The area is dimly lit by a few white lights and several glowing red lights, both in the middle and background, creating a moody atmosphere. Some structures resembling houses can be seen in the background. An armored figure with a glowing red eye is actively moving along the walkway towards another person who is on the ground further away. A white text overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the caption, \"PCPD Cop 02: Got you now, you piece of shit,\" corresponding to a speech bubble icon above the moving figure. The IGN logo is visible as a watermark in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
