    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a vast industrial landscape, focusing on the immense scale of the environment rather than a specific subject. A massive, conical pile of dark material dominates the right side of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. Another large pile occupies the bottom left foreground. In the left middle ground, a simple building is positioned, with a smaller structure slightly behind it toward the center. A tiny human figure stands in the bottom right middle ground, near the base of the large pile on the right. The entire scene is enclosed by towering rock walls in the background, with the camera positioned at a high angle, looking down on the scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a vast and desolate industrial landscape, likely depicting a quarry or mining operation inside a massive cavern. The scene features enormous, conical piles of dark, granular material prominently displayed in the foreground on both sides of a weathered building. The rock face is primarily situated behind and to the left of the building. Due to their considerable height, only portions of each pile are visible within the frame—one in the left foreground and the other in the right midground. Two small figures are located near the pile in the right midground, emphasizing the immense scale of the environment. Towering, rough-hewn rock walls enclose the area, contributing to the somber, hazy atmosphere of the location. The focus is on conveying the sheer size of the industrial operation rather than on any specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a vast, open-pit mine or quarry, enclosed by towering, rough-hewn rock walls predominantly situated behind and to the left of the weathered industrial buildings with gabled roofs. Immense, conical piles of dark, granular material, possibly coal or gravel, are positioned in front of both sides of the buildings. Due to their considerable height, only portions of these piles are visible within the frame. A series of utility poles with wires are scattered throughout the flat, dusty area. The color palette is muted, consisting primarily of browns and grays, under diffuse, even lighting. A lone, small human figure can be seen walking at the base of one of the massive piles, highlighting the enormous scale of the operation.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

Several cars are parked along the left and right edges of the frame in the middle ground, while a row of tall palm trees lines the background across the top. On the bottom left, a street vendor’s cart is visible, with a person standing behind it facing the camera. Two cyclists ride from the bottom right toward the center, moving from the foreground into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at street level, directly facing the statue and capturing the scene from the same height as the pedestrians.",
