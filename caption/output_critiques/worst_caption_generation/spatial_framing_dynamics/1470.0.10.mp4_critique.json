    "pre_caption": "The video shows a medium close-up shot of a person with short, red hair, wearing a white shirt, viewed from behind. The subject occupies the center of the frame throughout, positioned in the foreground. As the video progresses, the person moves forward, transitioning from facing away from the camera towards the middle ground of the room. The camera remains at the subject's height, maintaining a consistent perspective. Another individual, wearing a yellow top, is visible in the background, initially near the center-right and then shifting slightly to the right as the main subject advances. This secondary figure stands further back in the room, closer to the background. The room itself includes various elements such as a wooden door on the right, a fireplace with a painting above it in the center-back, and a lamp on the left side. These objects remain static while the primary subject moves, creating a dynamic contrast between the moving figure and the stationary surroundings. The camera captures the movement smoothly, keeping the main subject centered as they navigate the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with medium-length, straight red hair, wearing a white shirt. This individual is seen from behind, walking through a room and turning left. In the background, another person is visible, standing and wearing a yellow top. The setting appears to be indoors, with wooden paneling and various furnishings, including a lamp and a plant. The focus is primarily on the person with red hair as they move through the space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot showing a character’s upper body in an indoor setting. The environment is a cozy living room with wood-paneled walls and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The time of day is likely daytime, as natural light filters through the windows, illuminating the room. Notable visual elements include a wooden door, a fireplace with a painting above it, and a variety of furnishings such as two lamps, a plant, and a vase of yellow flowers. The room also features a single armchair, and the ceiling is white, contrasting with the predominantly wood-colored walls. The decor features a mix of earthy tones and soft textures, contributing to a homely feel. The character is positioned centrally, moving through the space, which adds a sense of motion to the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a group of three people seated around a glass coffee table, all facing the camera. The subjects are positioned across the lower half of the frame in the foreground, with the table extending horizontally in front of them. The person on the left wears a blue jacket and sits closest to the camera, while the other two, in green and black shirts, are spaced evenly toward the right. In the background, a large bookshelf fills the upper center and right of the frame, and a tall potted plant stands at the top left. The camera is set at eye level with the seated subjects. As the camera slowly zooms in, the shot transitions to a medium shot, bringing the group and table more prominently into view while the bookshelf and plant remain visible in the background. No subjects change position, but the zoom causes the table to occupy more of the lower frame, and the plant shifts slightly out of view on the left.",
