    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of the man, who occupies most of the frame. He is positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center to the left, with the urban street and buildings forming the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, showing more of the man's upper body while maintaining his central position. Initially, he faces slightly to the side, holding a silver object near his face. The camera remains at his level throughout. Afterward, the perspective shifts to show him from behind as he walks away down the tree-lined street. In this new angle, the man moves toward the center of the frame, with the street extending into the background. The camera continues to stay at his height, capturing his movement along the sidewalk. The buildings and greenery remain consistently in the background, providing context to the urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man wearing a brown hat with a darker brown or black band encircling it, sunglasses, and a brown jacket. He has a goatee and is holding a silver object close to his face. The man is positioned prominently in the foreground, facing slightly to the side. In the latter part of the video, he is seen from behind, walking away down a tree-lined street. The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and greenery visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor urban setting during the day, featuring a tree-lined street with brick buildings. The environment is calm, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the sidewalk. The street is lined with greenery, including bushes and trees, adding a natural element to the urban landscape. A person wearing a brown hat and jacket is present. The buildings have a classic architectural style, with visible windows. The overall atmosphere is serene, with no visible traffic or bustling activity, emphasizing the quiet nature of the neighborhood.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a woman standing in the center of a large open plaza, surrounded by fountains and benches. She is positioned in the middle ground, directly in the center of the frame, with several tall trees and a distant mountain range visible in the background. The camera is set slightly above her head, looking down at an angle. As the video continues, the woman walks toward the left side of the frame, moving from the middle ground into the foreground, while a group of children playing with balloons appears in the bottom right corner. The shot size gradually shifts to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the woman as she stops near a large stone sculpture. Throughout the scene, the camera maintains its elevated position, capturing the spatial relationship between the woman, the children, and the surrounding plaza elements. The background remains consistent, with the mountains and trees providing a scenic backdrop.",
