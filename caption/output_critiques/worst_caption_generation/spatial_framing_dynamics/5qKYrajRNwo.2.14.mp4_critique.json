    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a young girl positioned in the center of the frame, interacting with a small, open chest. She is in the foreground, with her body facing slightly to the right. The chest is located to her left, occupying the middle ground. The girl holds a golden pocket watch in her hands, which she examines closely. The camera remains at her eye level throughout the scene. In the background, the room's walls with circular cutouts allow soft light to filter through, creating a warm ambiance. The vintage lantern is positioned to the left of the chest, adding to the rustic setting. The girl's facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile as she interacts with the watch, maintaining focus on the object. The spatial composition emphasizes the intimate interaction between the girl and the chest's contents.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young girl with long, dark braided hair and a light skin tone. She is wearing a dark blue dress and is engaged with a small, open chest. In her hands, she holds a golden pocket watch, examining it closely. Her facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile, indicating interest and satisfaction. The setting suggests an intimate, focused moment as she interacts with the object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit atmosphere. The environment features a rustic room with wooden elements, including a table and a vintage lantern. A chest is open, revealing its contents, which include a small, round object and a gold chain. The walls have a pattern of circular cutouts, allowing soft light to filter through, creating a cozy ambiance. The scene is characterized by a sense of discovery and curiosity, with a focus on the interaction with the chest and its intriguing items. The overall color palette is earthy and muted, enhancing the intimate and nostalgic feel of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an elderly man seated on the far right side of the frame, reading a large newspaper. He is positioned in the background, while a tall bookshelf filled with colorful books occupies the center and left portions of the foreground. The man’s chair is slightly elevated above the camera, which is angled upward from below his eye level. Throughout the scene, the man occasionally glances over the top of his newspaper toward a potted plant situated at the bottom left corner of the frame in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary, and no significant spatial movement occurs among the elements. The spatial arrangement highlights the separation between the man and the bookshelf, with the plant serving as a visual anchor in the lower part of the composition.",
