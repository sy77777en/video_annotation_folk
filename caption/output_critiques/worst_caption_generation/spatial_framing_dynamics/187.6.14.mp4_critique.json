    "pre_caption": "This static medium shot frames a person from behind, positioned in the center-left of the frame and occupying the middle ground. They look out over a body of water that fills the foreground and middle ground. In the background, the sun is visible on the right side of the frame, with a flock of birds flying in the sky just to its left. Distant land is visible in the background on both the far left and far right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains stationary throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with dark skin is shown from behind, looking out towards the right. They wear a dark jacket with a light-colored graphic of what appears to be an animal's face on the back. Their head is covered with a richly patterned silk scarf, primarily featuring blue and yellow hues, tied in a knot at the back. In the distance, a small flock of birds flies as dark silhouettes against the sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene is set at sunset over a large, calm body of water. The sky displays a gradient from a muted teal at the top to a warm, orange glow near the horizon, where the sun is visible. In the distance, strips of land frame the water, and a flock of birds is silhouetted against the bright sky. The water's surface gently ripples, reflecting the warm light. A person is seen from behind, wearing a dark jacket and a patterned headscarf, looking out at the view. The video has a grainy, film-like aesthetic. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the subtitle: \"I see the warm light glowing through the clouds.\" in white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

A large city skyline fills the background, stretching across the top of the frame, while a row of parked cars lines the right edge in the foreground. The cyclists move slowly from left to right, and the camera remains stationary at a low angle, slightly below the subjects’ height. No significant changes in shot size or subject position occur during the clip.",
