    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, with no main subject. The bottom third of the frame is occupied by an arid desert landscape that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. A range of dark mountains stretches horizontally across the scene in the middle ground and background. The top two-thirds of the frame are dominated by a heavy, dark sky filled with storm clouds in the background. Columns of rain are visible falling from the clouds, primarily in the center of the frame over the mountains, with additional rain shafts on the left and right sides. The camera is positioned at a high elevation, looking out over the scene, and the shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot featuring a vast, turbulent sky filled with dark, heavy storm clouds tinged with purple and grey. Visible columns of intense rain pour down from the cloud base, concentrating in the center of the frame over a distant mountain peak. Below, a wide, arid expanse of brownish-green desert scrubland stretches towards the range of dark, rugged mountains on the horizon. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the weather event. The composition emphasizes the dramatic contrast between the violent storm and the sprawling, empty landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a vast, arid landscape under a dramatic, stormy sky. A range of low, dark mountains stretches across the horizon. The terrain extends across the foreground and middle ground, covered in sparse green and brown vegetation. The sky is filled with heavy, dark gray and purple clouds, from which distinct shafts of heavy rain are seen falling over the distant mountains.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The tree’s branches extend outward, reaching toward the left and right edges of the frame.
