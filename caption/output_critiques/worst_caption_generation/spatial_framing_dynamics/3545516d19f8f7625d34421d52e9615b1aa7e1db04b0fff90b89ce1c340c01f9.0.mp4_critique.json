    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, capturing a broad expanse of the environment. The lighthouse, positioned near the center-left of the frame, occupies the foreground and middle ground, standing prominently on a rocky shoreline. To the right of the lighthouse, a few small buildings with red roofs are visible, situated slightly further back in the middle ground. The surrounding greenery frames these structures, extending towards the background. On the far right, a tall communication tower rises vertically, located in the middle ground and partially in the background. The coastline curves gently from the left to the right side of the frame, bordered by a vast, calm blue sea that stretches across the entire background. The dense forest forms a continuous line along the horizon, separating the land from the sea. The camera maintains a high vantage point throughout, providing an aerial perspective that emphasizes the vastness of the landscape. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the camera remains steady, offering a consistent view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a coastal area with a prominent lighthouse surrounded by some houses, greenery, rocky shores, and expansive water. Additional, there is a ratio tower on the right side of the frame. The focus is on the vastness and natural beauty of the environment, highlighting the contrast between the land and sea. The lighthouse, while visually striking, is part of the broader landscape, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The video conveys a sense of tranquility and openness, with the sea level stretching into the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures an expansive coastal landscape during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring a prominent white lighthouse with a red top situated on a rocky shoreline. Surrounding the lighthouse are a few small buildings with red roofs, nestled among green trees. The coastline curves gently, bordered by a vast, calm blue sea on one side and a dense forest on the other. A tall communication tower stands nearby, adding a vertical element to the scene. The clear sky and bright sunlight enhance the natural colors, creating a serene and picturesque view of the coastal environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a bustling city street, with a large bronze statue positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. Several pedestrians are visible in the center and right portions of the frame, walking along a wide sidewalk that extends into the background. A row of parked bicycles lines the bottom right corner in the middle ground, while a series of tall glass office buildings rise in the background, occupying the top half of the frame. The camera is positioned at street level, matching the height of the pedestrians. As the camera slowly pans to the right, the statue moves out of view, and a bright yellow tram enters from the left, traveling across the center of the frame in the middle ground. The shot maintains a consistent height relative to the subjects, providing a clear view of the street activity and architectural elements throughout the scene.",
