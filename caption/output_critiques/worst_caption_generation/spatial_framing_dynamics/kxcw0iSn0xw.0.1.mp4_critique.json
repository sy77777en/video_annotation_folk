    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a man's head in the bottom center foreground, with a long celery stalk extending vertically from his mouth up through the center of the frame. In the middle ground, another person's hand is positioned to the left of the celery, and a portion of their head is visible to the right. The background is composed of dark, blurred foliage. A playing card enters from the left, travels horizontally across the middle of the frame, and slices the celery stalk in the center. The top portion of the celery is then propelled upward, while the card falls away to the left. The man and the bottom half of the celery remain stationary in their initial position at the bottom center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with some facial hair is shown from the neck up, looking directly upward. He wears a red baseball cap backward and is holding a long, green celery stalk vertically upward by biting it with his mouth. The celery stalk is then sliced in half by a playing card that is thrown through the air. Partially visible behind this man is another person's hand, which throws the card, and a portion of their head with short brown hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set outdoors against a dark, blurred background of green foliage, a long, green celery stalk is balanced vertically on a person's face. The person is wearing a red baseball cap worn backward and looking upward. In slow motion, a playing card is thrown from off-screen, slicing through the celery stalk. The top half of the stalk and the card are seen falling away, while the bottom portion remains momentarily in place.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person holding a piece of celery in his mouth, with only his head visible at the bottom of the frame. The celery takes up 70% of the frame’s height. Behind him, another person appears partially, with just part of their head and hand visible. The person behind throws a playing card, which cuts through the celery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To her left in the middle ground, a small dog sits facing the camera, while a potted plant is visible to her right in the background. The book is positioned horizontally, with its pages facing upward. A paper airplane enters from the top right, glides diagonally across the frame, and lands on the open book. The woman then looks down at the airplane, and the dog stands up and moves slightly toward her. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, angled downward, and remains stationary for the duration of the scene.",
