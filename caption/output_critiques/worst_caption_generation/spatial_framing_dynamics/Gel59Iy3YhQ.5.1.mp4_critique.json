    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, tracking a game character from behind, centered in the frame as they ascend a rocky path from the foreground toward the middle ground. The camera keeps the character centered, following their upward movement from a position at the subject's level. Upon reaching a circular stone platform on the summit in the middle ground, the character stops, and the shot zooms out, transitioning to a wide shot. In this final composition, the character remains in the center of the frame but is now smaller within the middle ground. The wide shot reveals an expansive landscape with a large sun in the upper-center background, and distant mountains rising from mist in the background. The camera's final position is slightly above the subject, looking down at them and across the vista.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video follows a male character, seen from behind, as he walks up a rocky path. He has long, white hair tied back in a braid with a black and white wrap at the top of his head. He is wearing a black long-sleeved top, dark pants, and a red sash around his waist. After ascending the path, he comes to a stop on a circular stone platform, standing still and continuing to face away from the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set on a flat, stone-paved clifftop in a mountainous region. The environment is bathed in the warm, golden light of a large sun positioned low on the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The ground is composed of geometric, light-colored stone slabs, with a prominent circular pattern etched into the surface. Small green bushes dot the rocky terrain. In the distance, stylized mountain peaks rise from a layer of low-lying mist, set against a hazy, pale sky. The video shows a character running across the clifftop before coming to a stop to overlook the expansive vista.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot, tracking a game character from behind as they ascend a rocky path toward the mountain top. The camera keeps the character centered, following their upward movement. Upon reaching the summit, the shot zooms out, transitioning to a wide shot that reveals an expansive landscape with distant mountains and the sun in the sky.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot, focusing on a pair of hands assembling a small mechanical device at the bottom right of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned slightly above the hands, looking down at the workspace. As the assembly progresses, the shot slowly pans left, revealing additional tools and components spread across the table in the middle ground, occupying the left and center portions of the frame. Midway through the video, there is a soft transition to an overhead wide shot, showing the entire tabletop with several people seated around it, their upper bodies visible in the background along the top edge of the frame. The camera remains above the subjects throughout, maintaining a consistent downward angle as the group collaborates on the project.",
