    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at a slightly elevated height, a gun occupies the bottom center foreground, initially aimed toward the center of the scene before moving to point toward the left. A blue minimap is positioned in the bottom left corner, while a blue ammunition counter is in the bottom right, both as foreground overlays. A large tree branch extends from the top right into the foreground. In the middle ground, two white cars are situated slightly right of center near a dirt road that crosses the frame. Additional trees and simple structures are scattered throughout the middle ground and background, with orange, diamond-shaped markers overlaid in the center on distant objects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a first-person perspective from a video game, looking out over a sunny landscape with clouds. In the foreground, a black assault rifle with a scope is initially pointed towards the center of the scene, but later shifts to point towards the left. The environment contains several green, leafy trees and bushes scattered across the brown, uneven terrain. In the midground, a white sedan and another white car are parked near some simple, blocky structures. A digital heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower-left corner, a blue ammunition counter in the lower-right, and orange, diamond-shaped objective markers in the center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out over a sunlit, arid outdoor area from a slightly elevated position. The metallic form of a weapon is held in the foreground. A dirt road runs through the midground, where several vehicles are situated, including two white cars. The landscape is dotted with sparse green and brown trees and low, simple structures in the distance. The scene includes several on-screen overlays: a blue minimap with green text is in the bottom-left corner, a blue display with an ammunition count is in the bottom-right, and orange, diamond-shaped icons with numbers float over distant objects.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

The subject’s head and upper torso are visible, with the camera positioned at shoulder height. To the left middle ground, a red bicycle leans against a wooden fence, while a yellow backpack rests on the ground to the right foreground. In the background, a small pond occupies the center, bordered by tall grass and a few benches along the top left and top right edges of the frame. A white cat walks from the bottom right foreground toward the center, passing behind the main subject. No significant changes in shot size or subject position occur during the scene.",
