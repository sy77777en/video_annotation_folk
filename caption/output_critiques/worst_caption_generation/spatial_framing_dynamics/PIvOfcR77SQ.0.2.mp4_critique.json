    "pre_caption": "A man is framed in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center foreground. He remains relatively stationary, though he turns his head slightly to the right. Behind him, a snow-covered road is visible on the right, stretching from the middle ground into the background. Deep snowbanks line the left and right sides of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, with a dense forest occupying the background. As the man holding the camera turns slightly to the right, a street sign comes into view in the right middle ground. The camera is held at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a medium skin tone, dark hair, and a full dark beard and mustache is shown. He is wearing a black hooded winter jacket with the hood pulled up over his head. Strapped to his chest is a light blue bag. An orange strap-like decoration is visible near his right shoulder. He stands while occasionally looking slightly to the right of the frame and speaking.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot captures a snowy, rural landscape on an overcast day. The scene is set beside a road flanked by deep snowbanks and a dense forest of tall evergreen and bare deciduous trees. The road surface is covered in snow, and a street sign with partially visible text \"LAUTAVAARANTIE\" appears in the right middleground during the latter half of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To her right, a large fountain occupies the center middle ground, with water visibly spraying upwards. In the background, a row of tall palm trees lines the top of the frame, stretching from left to right. As the woman walks toward the fountain, the camera slowly tilts upward, shifting the focus from her to the palm trees above. During this movement, a bicycle enters from the right edge of the frame in the foreground and stops near the fountain. The camera remains slightly above the subjects’ height throughout the video.",
