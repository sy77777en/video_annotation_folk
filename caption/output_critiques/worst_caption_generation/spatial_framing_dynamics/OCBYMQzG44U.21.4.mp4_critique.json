    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle perspective at the bottom of a staircase, looking up. The stairs begin in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and recede into the middle ground and background towards the top-center. Two black handrails are positioned in the middle ground, one on the left and one on the right, running diagonally upwards. The scene is framed by tiled walls on the left and right and a tiled ceiling at the top. A bright, white light source is located in the background at the top of the stairs. The camera moves steadily forward and upward, ascending the staircase. As the camera rises, the lower steps move out of the frame, and the handrails shift from the middle ground to the foreground before exiting the sides of the frame. The light source in the background grows larger, and as the camera nears the top, the faint outline of a room with two small, dark square openings becomes visible within the light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, ascending staircase. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and anticipation as the camera's perspective moves steadily upwards. The wide staircase is enclosed by walls and a ceiling covered in small, white, square tiles with a faint greenish hue, flanked by simple, thin black handrails. An intensely bright, white, and hazy light floods the space from the top of the stairs, obscuring the destination and lending the scene an ethereal, almost otherworldly quality. As the camera reaches the top, a relatively open space is revealed, characterized by high ceilings and expansive, minimalist design, enhancing the feeling of liberation and openness after the confined ascent.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves up a minimalist staircase within a hazy, enclosed stairwell. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, square, off-white tiles. Two thin, black, cylindrical handrails run parallel to the wide, light-colored steps. The entire scene is illuminated from above by an intensely bright, white light emanating from the space above the stairs, creating a foggy, ethereal glow. As the perspective ascends the stairs, the faint outline of another room becomes visible within the brilliant light, featuring two small, dark square openings.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject is positioned at eye level with the camera, facing forward, with their upper body and head fully visible. To the left and right of the subject, two large potted plants are placed symmetrically, each in the foreground near the bottom corners of the frame. Behind the subject, a large window spans the background, allowing soft daylight to illuminate the scene. The camera remains stationary throughout, with no noticeable movement or change in shot size. No other subjects or significant elements enter or exit the frame during the video.",
