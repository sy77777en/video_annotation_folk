    "pre_caption": "A full shot centers on a giant orange pumpkin in the middle ground, which rests on a wooden platform occupying the bottom portion of the frame. In the foreground, a dark green cap is positioned at the bottom center, at the base of the pumpkin. White fabric walls are visible in the background and middle ground, framing the pumpkin on the left, right, and top. In the bottom left, concrete blocks are visible in the middle ground under the fabric. The camera is positioned at the pumpkin's level, and the shot remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A very large, round, orange pumpkin with deep vertical ribs is shown in a full view. The giant pumpkin rests on a flat wooden surface. In the foreground, at the base of the pumpkin, sits a dark green baseball cap with a circular logo on its front.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A large, round, orange pumpkin with deep vertical ridges is positioned on a platform made of wooden planks. The scene is set within an enclosed area defined by white fabric walls draped in both the middleground and background. In the foreground, a dark green cap with an orange circular logo rests on the wooden platform at the base of the pumpkin. To the left, multiple concrete blocks are visible supporting the structure beneath the white fabric.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To the right, a small stack of yellow books sits in the middle ground, partially overlapping the vase. In the background, a brick wall stretches across the entire width of the frame, with a narrow window visible at the top left. A metal chair is positioned at the bottom left in the foreground, angled slightly toward the vase.
