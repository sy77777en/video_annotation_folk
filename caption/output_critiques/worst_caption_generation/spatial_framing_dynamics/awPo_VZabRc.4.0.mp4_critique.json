    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, an animated man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, seated at a counter that spans the foreground. A pile of items rests on the counter in the bottom-left foreground. Behind the man, a large, translucent pink entity occupies the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. The entity's arm moves from behind the man, extending forward over the counter toward the pile of items in the bottom-left. The man, who holds a wallet in his right hand, initially has his left hand on the counter near the pile before pulling it back toward his body. The camera remains stationary at the man's eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated man with a stylized, angular appearance has pale skin, intense dark eyes, and spiky black hair. He is dressed in a white t-shirt and a black jacket with a high collar. He holds an open pink wallet and looks down at it with a focused expression. Looming behind him is a large, translucent, glowing pink humanoid entity. This ghostly figure has two bright, glowing white eyes and an indistinct form with arms and a torso. At one point, a golden crown is visible on its head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting bathed in a reddish-pink glow, a man with black hair sits at a light-brown counter. The counter, which stretches across the foreground, is cluttered with a pile of cards and keys. In the background, simple, dark tables are faintly visible. A large, translucent pink figure with glowing white eyes stands behind the man, its arm reaching over the counter towards the pile of items. The man, wearing a black jacket over a white shirt, holds an open pink wallet in his hand.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",

A small dog sits at her feet in the bottom-left foreground. On the right side of the frame, a tall bookshelf occupies the middle ground, stacked with books and plants. The woman raises her right arm to point at the window, while the dog remains still. The camera is positioned slightly above the woman’s head, looking down at the scene. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly pans right, bringing the bookshelf and its contents into the center of the frame while the woman and dog move out of view to the left.",
