    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a young man stands in the right-center of the frame and the middle ground, in front of a house with concrete steps. Several playing cards are suspended in the air in the middle ground around him. As the video progresses, the camera rotates clockwise around the man, keeping him as the central point of the arc. This movement shifts the man's position to the left side of the frame and changes the background from the front of the house to its side and a yard with trees. The floating cards also move relative to the background, ending up scattered in the air in the center and right portions of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young man with short, brown hair is shown wearing a yellow short-sleeved t-shirt with a black and white logo on the chest that includes the letters \"SC\". He stands with his right arm extended forward as if throwing something. Several standard playing cards, including a King of Spades and a Ten of Diamonds, are visible in the air around him, seemingly in mid-flight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors during the day in the yard of a house with light blue horizontal siding and white trim around the windows. A set of weathered concrete steps with a simple white metal railing leads up to a dark door. The camera rotates clockwise around a man in yellow clothing and some playing cards, revealing more of the house's side and a background of green trees and bushes. The ground is damp, and a grassy area with some dirt patches is visible. In the distance, a dirt path runs behind the foliage, along with bushes, trees, and another house, under an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

A small dog lies at her feet, occupying the bottom left corner of the frame. As the video continues, the camera slowly tilts upward, raising the woman and dog toward the lower third of the frame while bringing more of the sky and treetops into view. The woman remains seated and stationary, while the dog briefly stands and moves toward the center before lying down again. The camera maintains a slightly elevated angle above the subjects throughout the shot.",
