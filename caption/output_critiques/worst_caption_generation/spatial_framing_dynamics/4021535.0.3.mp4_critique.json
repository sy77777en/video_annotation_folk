    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot is framed from a high angle, looking down upon the scene. A pile of sugar crystals occupies the left foreground and middle ground, with a large group of ants concentrated on and around it. In the center-right middle ground, a smaller cluster of ants is initially gathered. As the video progresses, these ants on the right begin to move in a loose line toward the top right of the frame, eventually exiting the view, while the ants on the left continue to crawl over the sugar and the immediate surrounding area. Individual ants are also visible moving in the right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A collection of small ants, distinguished by their reddish-brown heads and thoraxes and darker, almost black, abdomens, are actively crawling on and around a scattered pile of clear, irregularly shaped, crystalline sugar granules. Some ants are also actively carrying sugar crystals. These subjects are situated on a light blue-grey, rough-textured surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up, macro view, a colony of small, reddish-brown ants with dark abdomens swarms over a pile of clear, crystalline sugar granules. The scene is set on a rough, textured, blue-gray surface with visible cracks and imperfections. The ants are in constant motion, with some forming a line and moving away from the sugar pile, while others crawl over the sugar and the surrounding area, clustering in small groups or moving independently.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",

A group of small toy cars is arranged in a semicircle along the bottom right foreground, middle ground, and background, with a single large marble placed at the center left middle ground. Throughout the video, the marble remains stationary while the toy cars gradually roll from the bottom right toward the center of the frame, eventually forming a tight cluster around the marble. The camera remains below the level of the cars and marble, emphasizing their height against the background.",
