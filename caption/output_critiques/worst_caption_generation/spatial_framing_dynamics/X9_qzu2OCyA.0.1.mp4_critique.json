    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high-angle, locked-on perspective, the skier, Emma Dahlström, is consistently framed in the center foreground, moving forward down the slope. As she skis, the background scenery scrolls past her. A ski lift tower, initially in the top-left middle ground, recedes into the background. A high bank of snow is visible in the background on the right side of the frame. A text overlay with her name is fixed in the bottom-left corner. The skier's position remains static within the frame, while the environment moves relative to her, creating a dynamic sense of forward motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman, identified by the text \"EMMA DAHLSTRÖM,\" is shown skiing. She wears a black helmet and large, reflective blue ski goggles that obscure her eyes. A black neck gaiter covers the lower half of her face. Her outerwear is a red varsity-style jacket with grey sleeves, white stripes on the cuffs and collar, and a white logo on the left chest. She also wears black ski pants and gloves with yellow and green accents. She is on red and black skis and holds yellow ski poles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, the perspective follows a skier moving down a wide, groomed snow slope on a sunny day. The white snow is marked with corduroy tracks, and the skier's shadow is cast to the left. As the skier progresses, the ski lift tower transitions from the midground to the background, with only the base of the tower captured in the video. In the background, a high bank of snow is visible on the right side of the path against a bright blue sky. A white text overlay inside a black box, reading \"EMMA DAHLSTRÖM,\" is positioned in the lower-left portion of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "In a medium close-up shot from a low-angle, handheld perspective, a cyclist is positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, pedaling slowly along a paved city street. The left side of the frame features a row of parked cars in the foreground, while tall buildings fill the background across the top of the frame. A streetlamp appears briefly in the top-right corner as the camera pans left to follow the cyclist’s movement. A digital timer overlay is fixed in the top-left corner. The camera remains below the cyclist’s eye level throughout, emphasizing the upward view as the cyclist moves from right to left across the scene.",
