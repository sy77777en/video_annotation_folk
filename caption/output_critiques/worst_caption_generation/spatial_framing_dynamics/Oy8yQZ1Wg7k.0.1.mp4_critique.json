    "pre_caption": "This is a low-angle medium shot of four people grouped together in the foreground, looking down toward the camera. A woman with an eyepatch occupies the left side of the frame, next to a woman with braids in the center-left. A man in a suit is positioned in the center, and another woman is on the right. The background, visible at the top of the frame, consists of a ceiling with exposed wooden beams.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Four people, three women and one man, are shown together from a worm's eye perspective, looking down with serious expressions. On the far left is a light-skinned woman with long, straight blonde hair and a black eyepatch over her right eye, wearing a black ribbed top and a wide black belt. Next to her is a woman with a medium-dark skin tone and long, dark braided hair, wearing a black ribbed turtleneck. In the center is a light-skinned, middle-aged man with short dark hair, dressed in a black suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a black tie. On the far right is a light-skinned woman with East Asian features and long, dark, straight hair, wearing a black ribbed top and with her left hand on her hip.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's eye perspective looking directly up, the scene is set indoors within a room featuring a ceiling with exposed wooden beams. The dark, parallel rafters form a grid-like pattern against the warm-toned wood. Four figures dressed predominantly in black are positioned in a semi-circle, looking down toward the camera's viewpoint.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

A man wearing a chef’s hat is positioned at the bottom right of the frame, a woman in a red dress sits at the bottom left, and another man in a blue shirt is at the top center. The table, covered with a white tablecloth and several plates of food, occupies the center of the frame. In the background, large windows are visible along the top edge of the frame. The camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down at them from a significant height. There are no notable changes in shot size or subject position throughout the scene.",
