    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, a rifle is held in the bottom foreground. A soldier is positioned in the center-right of the middle ground, with a large hay bale to the left. The camera moves forward, following the soldier who walks toward the background, revealing a body on the ground to their left. A chain-link fence becomes more defined in the right background. The weapon in the foreground is then swapped from the rifle to a pistol. The camera stops, with the followed soldier now positioned in the left-middle ground near a rock and trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective through green-tinted night vision, a pair of hands in light-colored gloves holds a rifle with a red dot sight. The view follows another soldier walking away from the camera. This soldier is dressed in full combat gear, including a helmet, a light-colored tactical vest with multiple pouches, and a large backpack. An icon briefly identifies their weapon as an AK-47. A body lies on the ground to the left of the walking soldier. Later, the hands in the foreground switch from the rifle to a pistol.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a nighttime scene in a rural, wooded area, viewed through green-tinted night vision. The camera moves forward across a grassy field with large, round hay bales on the left. In the background, the dark silhouettes of pine trees stand against the night sky, and a chain-link fence with a gate is visible to the right. The scene includes a heads-up display with various on-screen elements. Text at the top left briefly reads \"Checkpoint reached.\" A vertical gauge is on the left, and ammunition information is displayed in the bottom right corner. A subtitle at the bottom center reads, \"Price: Overlook's ahead...\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

The camera remains stationary at waist height, capturing the subject from the knees up. As the scene progresses, the person steps to the left, partially obscuring the bicycle, while a small dog enters from the bottom right foreground and sits near the crate. No significant changes in camera height or angle occur throughout the video.",
