    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, the scene is framed looking down. The subject's hands are in the center foreground, with their legs and patterned shorts visible at the bottom center. The left hand, positioned centrally, lowers a brick onto a low wall that extends from the bottom left to the center of the frame. To the right, a set of concrete stairs occupies the middle ground, running from the top to the bottom of the frame, with white strings draped across them. The background in the top left shows dirt, plants, and a coiled blue hose. The primary movement is the left hand pressing the brick down onto the mortar.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a man with a dark skin tone, wearing dark shorts with a purple and white pattern, is laying bricks. He uses his left hand to carefully place a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a layer of wet, grey mortar on a low wall. In his right hand, he holds another identical brick. The construction is taking place next to a set of concrete stairs, with thin white strings looped and resting on the stairs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures an outdoor construction scene during a bright day. The perspective looks down at a low wall being built with rectangular, reddish-orange clay bricks laid upon a bed of wet, grey mortar. A white string is looped around the stairs, lying loosely across them. The ground consists of reddish-brown dirt, loose gravel, and patches of green vegetation, with a coiled blue hose visible in the background. The person's hands are seen positioning a brick, while their legs, clad in patterned shorts, are visible below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot from a low-angle perspective, looking up at a person standing near the center of the frame. The subject’s upper body and face are visible in the foreground, with their right arm extended toward the top right corner. In the middle ground, a wooden table stretches from the left edge to the center, holding several glass jars and a small potted plant positioned at the top left. To the bottom right, a bicycle wheel is partially visible in the background, resting against a brick wall that runs horizontally across the frame. The camera is positioned below the subject’s waist, angled upward. The main movement is the subject reaching up to adjust a hanging lantern above their head.",
