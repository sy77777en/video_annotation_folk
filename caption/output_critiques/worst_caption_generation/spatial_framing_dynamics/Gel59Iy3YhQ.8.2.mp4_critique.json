    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from a high-angle, isometric perspective, showing a pixel-art bedroom that occupies the central and right portions of the frame. In the background, a large window is positioned on the top-left wall, with white closet doors on the right wall. A bed is centered in the middle ground, flanked by a nightstand on its left and another on its right. User interface icons are overlaid in the top-left and top-right corners, as well as along the left and right edges of the screen. Throughout the video, a framed certificate, initially held by a cursor in the bottom-left foreground, is moved over the bed in the middle ground before disappearing. Concurrently, a pink stuffed pig appears on the left nightstand, and a cardboard box materializes in the bottom-right foreground at the foot of the bed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an isometric, pixel-art depiction of a bedroom being organized. The room contains a double bed with a black headboard and grey chevron-patterned bedding, positioned against a wall with a large window showing a nighttime city. On the bed are several stacks of neatly folded clothes in green, blue, and purple. The bed is flanked by two black nightstands. A pink stuffed pig rests on the left nightstand, while a black digital clock, a speaker, and a grey briefcase sit on the right one. During the video, a framed certificate is manipulated by the mouse and moves around the room, and a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper appears at the foot of the bed. Additionally, there are overlay icons located in the top-left and top-right corners, as well as along the left and right edges of the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows a pixel-art bedroom at night. The room is furnished with a double bed featuring a black headboard and grey chevron-patterned bedding, set against a large window that looks out onto a brightly lit city. The bed is flanked by two black nightstands, and a white bi-fold closet door is visible on the right wall. During the sequence, items are seen in the scene, including a pink stuffed pig on the left nightstand and a cardboard box filled with crumpled paper at the left foot of the bed. A framed certificate is controlled by the mouse and moves around the room. The scene is framed by a gaming user interface, with icons for camera controls, room navigation, and zoom functions in the corners.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

A refrigerator is located on the bottom-right wall, while a stove is placed on the left side. A dining table sits in the center, with a single chair on its right and a potted plant on its left. User interface icons are displayed in the bottom-right and bottom-left corners, as well as along the top and bottom edges of the screen. During the video, a digital clock, initially resting on the table in the center, is dragged by a cursor to the stove before being placed on the refrigerator. A blue ceramic mug appears on the right side of the table, and a loaf of bread appears in the top-left corner as the camera pans horizontally to the left. The camera remains at the same height as the table throughout the scene.",
