    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a surfboard that occupies the bottom foreground. To her left, a large wave occupies the middle ground, while a distant, tree-lined shore is visible in the top left background against a cloudy sky in the top right. As the video progresses, the wave on the left curls over and moves toward the center, engulfing the woman in a large splash of water that fills the center and right of the frame, temporarily obscuring her from view. The camera, positioned at the subject's level on the surfboard, remains fixed as the water moves into the immediate foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with brown hair tied back is shown surfing on a white surfboard. She is wearing a yellow two-piece bikini. She stands barefoot on the board, bending her knees and extending her arms out to her sides for balance. As she rides, she is briefly engulfed by a large splash of water from the curling wave. The white surfboard has a black sticker or marking visible near her front foot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted on a white surfboard, the scene captures the dynamic environment of ocean surfing. A large, dark blue wave curls powerfully, its crest breaking into white foam and spray against a bright, cloudy sky. Initially, a green, tree-lined shore is visible in the distance but then moves out of the frame as the camera follows the action. The perspective remains fixed to the board as it glides across the water's surface, with the curling wave eventually enveloping the woman on the surfboard in a rush of white water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To his right, a small dog sits on the ground in the middle ground, near the center of the frame. Behind them, a row of bicycles is lined up along the top-right background, partially obscured by a low hedge. The camera is set slightly above the subjects, angled downward. As the video continues, the man stands up and walks toward the right edge of the frame, while the dog remains stationary. The camera pans slowly to follow the man’s movement, keeping him in the lower-right foreground and shifting the bench out of view.",
