    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of three black goats in a dry, grassy landscape. Initially, the first goat, larger in size, is positioned near the bottom left of the frame in the foreground, facing right and walking towards the center. It is near a small bush. The second and third goats, smaller in size, enter the frame from the left, moving side by side behind the first goat. They are positioned in the middle ground, oriented towards the right. As they follow the first goat, they transition to a single-file line, with the second goat moving to the center and the third goat slightly behind it. The scene is set in an open environment with tall, golden-brown grass and scattered green shrubs, providing a natural backdrop. The camera remains at the goats' level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective as the goats navigate the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three black goats in a dry, grassy area. The first goat is relatively large in size, with a prominent beard, and stands near a small bush, facing to the right as it walks. Its coat is uniformly black. The second and third goats, also black, are smaller in size. After entering the frame side by side behind the first goat, they follow it one in front of the other and are oriented towards the right. All three goats are surrounded by tall, yellowish-brown grass, with sparse green vegetation nearby, suggesting a natural, open environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene in a dry, grassy landscape during the daytime. The environment features tall, golden-brown grass with scattered green shrubs and small bushes. The terrain is uneven, with patches of bare earth visible among the vegetation. The lighting is bright, indicating clear weather. The scene includes three black goats, which walk toward the right side of the frame among the grass and bushes, adding movement as they navigate the area. The overall setting conveys a natural, open space with a focus on the interaction between the animals and their surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two white sheep standing on a rocky hillside. At the start, the first sheep is located at the top right of the frame in the background, facing left and grazing near a large boulder. The second sheep appears from the bottom center, moving upward into the middle ground and stopping beside a small patch of wildflowers. As the scene progresses, the first sheep walks diagonally toward the bottom left, while the second sheep remains stationary. The landscape features short green grass and several scattered pine trees, creating a lush setting. The camera is positioned slightly below the subjects, angled upward, and maintains this low-angle perspective throughout the video.",
