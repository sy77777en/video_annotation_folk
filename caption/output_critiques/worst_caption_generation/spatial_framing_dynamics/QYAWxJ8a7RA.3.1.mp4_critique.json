    "pre_caption": "This medium shot is framed from within a dark space, looking out through a wooden-beamed entrance that occupies the foreground. A glowing blue figure stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, adjusting a hard hat. To the left of this central figure, a dark, silhouetted figure is also positioned in the middle ground. Another silhouetted figure is located in the right middle ground, slightly behind the central one. The background is a hazy, dust-filled environment, and the camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a stylized figure of a man depicted in a blue hue, centrally located. He is wearing a suit, a dark tie, glasses, and a hard hat. His left hand is on his head adjusting the hard hat, while his right hand is raised, pointing a flashlight towards the camera, creating a glare. Flanking this central figure are other stylized figures of men in a dark shade of brown, also wearing hard hats. One of these figures stands to the left of the main subject, while another is positioned further back and to the right. All figures are seen through a dark, wooden-beamed frame, with the camera looking out into a brighter, hazy environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Viewed from within a dark, enclosed space, the scene looks out through a rectangular entrance framed by rough, dark wooden beams. Beyond the opening, a hazy, dust-filled environment is illuminated by a diffuse light. Several figures wearing hard hats occupy this space. A central figure, distinguished by a glowing blue color and dressed in a suit and tie, is seen adjusting their hat. This figure is flanked by other, darker, silhouetted figures, also in hard hats. Small, light-colored particles float throughout the air, contributing to the dusty atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

In the foreground, a group of three children sits on a picnic blanket near the bottom right of the frame, facing away from the camera. A red bicycle is parked upright on the left side of the middle ground, partially obscured by tall grass. The sky occupies the top half of the frame, with scattered clouds stretching across the top left and top center. Throughout the scene, the camera remains at a low angle, positioned below the subjects’ eye level, and there are no significant changes in shot size or subject placement during the video.",
