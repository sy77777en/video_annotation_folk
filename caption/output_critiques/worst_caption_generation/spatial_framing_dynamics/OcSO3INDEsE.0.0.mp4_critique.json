    "pre_caption": "This video is a revealing wide shot captured by a static camera at a level height. Initially, a dark, textured slope occupies the bottom of the frame, rising from the bottom right to the middle left. A woman appears in the middle ground on the left, walking down the slope toward the right. As she moves, a textured blue area expands from the far left, moving rightward to fill the background. Simultaneously, the portion of the dark slope in the foreground and middle ground transforms into a green hill, a change that also progresses from left to right. The text \"CAPABLE of LOVE\" appears in the top center, and its font transforms from left to right as the blue area sweeps over it. Flowers then sprout in the foreground and middle ground on the newly formed green hill, following the same left-to-right progression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a hand-drawn animated scene around a woman in black-and-white style. Initially, the woman, who has long hair and wears a short dress, is seen walking down a dark, barren slope while pulling a small suitcase. As the video progresses, a large, textured, light-blue area appears behind her from the very beginning and gradually extends, transforming the ground into a green, grassy hill as she walks. The words \"CAPABLE of LOVE\" initially appear in a simple black font and gradually change to a green, vine-like font as the woman walks and the blue area sweeps across them. Small, red, star-shaped flowers sprout all over the hill within the green-colored ground area, followed by the growth of larger purple flowers with yellow centers and green stems across the slope.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated video presents a stylized outdoor scene. Initially, a black-and-white stylized woman pulling a suitcase walks down a dark, textured hill against a stark white background. The part to the left of the woman transforms into a colorful, crayon-like drawing. A textured blue area gradually extends from behind the woman to cover the front of her, filling the background, and the corresponding section of the hill turns a vibrant green, sprouting red, star-shaped flowers and larger purple blossoms. Text appears across the top center, with \"CAPABLE\" and \"of LOVE\" initially in a simple black font. As the blue area sweeps across them, the words change to a green, vine-like font and eventually disappear after becoming totally green.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.",

At the start, a large, circular fountain is centered in the foreground, with water visibly flowing from the top. A man stands on the right side of the fountain, facing left, while a small dog sits at the bottom left corner of the frame in the middle ground. The background is filled with tall, leafy trees stretching from the left to the right edge of the frame. As the video progresses, the man walks around the fountain in a clockwise direction, and the dog follows behind him, maintaining a consistent distance. Midway through, a red balloon rises from the bottom center of the frame, moving upward and exiting at the top center. The text \"SUMMER IN THE PARK\" appears in the bottom right corner, remaining static until the end of the video. No significant changes in camera height or shot size occur throughout the scene.",
