    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from an eye-level perspective. The video begins with a snow-covered car in the left middle ground and a small, dark log cabin with string lights in the center-right middle ground. A larger building and a tree line are visible in the background under a cloudy sky, while a vast expanse of snow fills the foreground. The camera then pans smoothly to the right, revealing a red building with two garage doors on the left and bringing a large red house with a lit Christmas tree into view on the right. The pan concludes with the red house positioned in the right middle ground, a lit path leading into the center of the scene, and another small wooden structure visible in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a winter landscape scenery shot capturing a serene, snow-covered rural property at twilight. The video pans across a vast expanse of deep, white snow, revealing several buildings including a small log cabin and a larger red house, both adorned with warm, festive string lights. Bare, skeletal trees stand against a cloudy, dusky sky, while a couple of parked cars and a snowmobile are partially buried in the snow. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the camera's sweeping motion is intended to capture the quiet, cold atmosphere and the picturesque quality of the entire snowy environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans across a rural landscape blanketed in deep snow during twilight. The overcast sky is a mix of dark clouds and pale light above a distant tree line. The scene features several structures, including a dark log cabin with a string of warm lights on its corner, a red building with two white garage doors, and another red house with a lit Christmas tree outside. Bare, leafless trees are scattered throughout the area, and a dark sedan and a snow-covered car are parked nearby. A path with small lamps leads further into the property, where another small wooden outbuilding is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a medium shot taken from a slightly elevated angle. The video opens with a large fountain in the center foreground, surrounded by several people sitting on benches along the bottom left and right edges of the frame. In the middle ground, a row of bicycles is lined up parallel to the camera, stretching from the left to the center. Behind the bicycles, a tall glass office building occupies the background, with its top reaching the upper edge of the frame. The camera tilts downward as a group of children runs from the right background toward the center foreground, passing in front of the fountain. The shot ends with the children gathered near the benches, while the office building remains visible in the background. The camera remains above the subjects’ eye level throughout the scene.",
