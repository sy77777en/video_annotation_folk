    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, frames two sea lions at a wooden dock. One sea lion is positioned in the upper center of the frame, lying on the dock in the middle ground. A second sea lion is in the bottom center, with its upper body emerging from the water in the foreground. The weathered wooden dock extends horizontally across the middle ground, with an algae-covered piling standing on the right. The sea lion in the water creates splashes as it looks up toward the stationary sea lion on the dock.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two dark, wet sea lions are interacting on and around a wooden dock. One sea lion is lying on its stomach on the dock, propped up on its front flippers. It has its head raised and its mouth wide open, showing its teeth and the pink interior of its mouth. In the water below, a second sea lion has its head and neck extended upwards, looking at the one on the dock. Its mouth is also open, and its long whiskers are visible. Both animals appear to be vocalizing at each other.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime scene, two dark sea lions interact at a weathered wooden dock situated in greenish water. One sea lion rests on the dock's surface, which features a metal cleat, while the other is partially submerged in the water beside it, creating splashes. A thick, algae-covered piling stands on the right side of the dock. Both animals are positioned with their mouths open, facing one another.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The pelican is located in the lower right of the frame, occupying the foreground, with its wings partially spread. In the upper left background, a small fishing boat is visible, docked alongside a concrete pier that runs diagonally across the scene. A cluster of fishing nets is stacked in the middle ground near the center left. The camera remains below the pelican’s eye level throughout, and there are no significant changes in shot size or subject position during the video.",
