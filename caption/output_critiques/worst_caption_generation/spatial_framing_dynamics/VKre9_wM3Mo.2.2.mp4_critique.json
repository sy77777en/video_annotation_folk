    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, three toilets are arranged in a diagonal line receding from the foreground on the left to the background on the right. The primary subject, a single toilet, is positioned in the foreground, slightly left of center, and is clearly in focus. A second toilet is situated in the middle ground to the right, and a third is in the background, further to the right; both are progressively out of focus, creating a sense of depth. A soft, white spotlight is cast on the floor in the bottom center, directly under the foreground toilet. The camera is positioned above the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, empty space, three white, translucent toilets are arranged in a diagonal line receding into the distance. The toilet in the midground is the most prominent and in focus, with its lid open. It emits a bright blue glow from within its bowl and is illuminated from above by an unseen light source. The two other toilets behind it are progressively dimmer and more out of focus, but they appear to be the same size as the one in the midground. They also have their lids open and emit a similar, though fainter, blue glow from their bowls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space with a glossy black floor, a series of translucent toilets are arranged in a diagonal line receding into the background. The toilet in the midground is in focus, emitting a bright blue glow from within its bowl, which casts a soft, white reflection on the surface below. The toilets further back are progressively out of focus, their blue glow appearing more diffuse in the darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The main bicycle is positioned closer to the camera, with its handlebars turned slightly toward the right. A third bicycle is partially visible in the background on the far right, mostly obscured by a large potted plant. The floor beneath the bicycles is covered with a patterned rug that extends from the bottom center to the middle ground. The camera is set at the same height as the bicycles, capturing them straight on.",
