    "pre_caption": "From a first-person, eye-level perspective, a firearm with a holographic sight occupies the bottom half of the frame in the immediate foreground. Initially, a large hay bale is positioned in the left foreground, with additional hay bales visible in the center middle ground. The background is filled with the silhouettes of pine trees across the top of the frame. The view slowly pans to the right, shifting the central hay bales further into the center and revealing more of the open space between them. Throughout the pan, the firearm remains fixed in its foreground position relative to the camera. A digital heads-up display is overlaid on the scene, with a vertical bar on the left and ammunition information in the bottom right corner, both remaining static within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night-vision display, a person wearing white gloves holds a dark-colored firearm. The weapon is equipped with a large, boxy holographic sight on its top rail. A digital heads-up display is superimposed on the view, indicating an ammunition count of 13 in the magazine and 90 in reserve. The person is positioned near a large, cylindrical hay bale in a dark, outdoor setting. In the background, additional hay bales and the silhouettes of several pine trees are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a nighttime scene in a rural, wooded area, viewed through a green night vision filter. In the foreground, a rifle with a holographic sight is held by gloved hands. The view pans slowly across a field containing large, cylindrical hay bales, with a dark forest of tall pine trees visible in the background. The scene is augmented with a digital heads-up display overlay, featuring a white crosshair in the center, a vertical bar with changing numbers on the left, and ammunition counters and icons in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

To the left middle ground, a bicycle leans against a wooden fence, while a small dog sits near the bottom right foreground. The background shows a row of brick houses stretching across the top of the frame. The camera remains stationary at chest height, level with the subject’s torso, as the person slowly raises their right hand to wave. No other elements move or change position during the shot.",
