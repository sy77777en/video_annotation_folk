    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera-wearer's lower body and helmet occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A second skydiver is positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a vast, arid landscape filling the background. The camera is positioned directly above this second person, looking down. As the video progresses, the camera-wearer extends their legs, which move from the bottom center to frame the sides of the shot. Simultaneously, the second skydiver, while remaining in the center, recedes further into the distance, appearing to shrink in size as the gap between the two individuals increases.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, the lower body of a person is visible, wearing light-colored pants, dark shoes with bright teal laces, and a black and green harness around their waist. The bottom of their black helmet is seen at the lower edge of the view. Positioned below and in the center is another person in freefall, seen from above. This second individual wears a multicolored jumpsuit featuring orange, yellow, and red colors, along with a black helmet. They are positioned with their back to the earth, both hands raised with the middle fingers extended.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot captures a perspective looking straight down from high in the sky during a daytime scene. The vast, arid landscape below is a patchwork of brown and tan rolling hills and valleys, with a winding dirt path or dry riverbed visible. From the bottom of the view, the camera-wearer's black helmet and legs in light-colored pants are visible. Farther below, another person in a colorful jumpsuit is seen against the expansive terrain.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed from a camera mounted on a person’s helmet in the air, shooting downward at another person falling. The lower body and part of the helmet of the person with the camera are visible, while the falling person’s whole body is visible, gradually shrinking in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot showing a person standing upright in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. To the left, a large tree extends from the bottom left to the top left corner, its branches reaching into the upper part of the frame and forming a partial canopy. In the background, a row of parked cars lines the right side of the frame, stretching from the middle ground to the background. The camera is positioned at eye level with the standing person. As the video progresses, the person walks from the center toward the right edge of the frame, moving from the middle ground into the background, while the tree remains stationary. The camera pans slightly to follow the person’s movement, keeping them in view as they approach the cars.",
