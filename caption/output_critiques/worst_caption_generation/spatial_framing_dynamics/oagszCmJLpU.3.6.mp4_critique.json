    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a vast landscape with no primary subject. A flat prairie occupies the bottom third of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background horizon. The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the composition. Heavy, dark clouds are positioned across the middle ground of the sky, while a curtain of rain falls in the background, centered along the horizon. Lighter clouds are visible at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up toward the sky. A very slow, subtle forward movement or zoom occurs, directed toward the rain in the center of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a vast, ominous sky filled with turbulent storm clouds. The clouds are a deep, moody teal and gray, with their upper edges catching a soft pink and white light, creating a stark contrast against the darkness. Below the heavy cloud cover, a curtain of rain falls in the distance, illuminated by a diffuse, greenish-white light that breaks through the gloom. The land is an expansive, flat prairie covered in yellowish-green grass, stretching out to a distant, unbroken horizon. There is no main subject in the composition; the focus is instead on the immense scale of the environment and the powerful, atmospheric mood created by the impending storm over the open plains.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a vast, flat prairie under a dramatic, turbulent sky. Heavy storm clouds, colored in shades of dark gray and deep teal, dominate the view, with lighter, pink-tinged areas visible at the top. In the distance, sheets of rain fall from the base of the clouds, creating a hazy curtain over the horizon. The ground is a wide expanse of green and yellow grass that stretches out to meet the storm.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

A narrow dirt path runs from the bottom left corner toward the base of the tree, with small wildflowers scattered along its edges in the foreground. In the background, a wooden fence stretches horizontally across the frame, dividing the scene. The sky, visible only in the top right corner, is mostly clear with a few small birds flying near the upper edge. The camera is set at eye level with the tree, remaining steady throughout the shot with no noticeable movement or transitions.",
