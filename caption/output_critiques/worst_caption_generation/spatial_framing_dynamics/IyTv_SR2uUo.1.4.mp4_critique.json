    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a full shot, capturing a runner in the right foreground, a man in a pink shirt in the left middle ground, and a group of people in the right middle ground, with a white line running across the immediate foreground. The background consists of a stadium and a cityscape. The runner moves from right to left, and as she passes close to the subject-level camera, the framing briefly becomes a medium shot. The camera pans left to follow her as she moves away into the middle ground, transitioning back to a full shot. She then approaches a man holding a yellow tackle pad obstáculos in the center middle ground before moving toward the left of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video primarily features a young, light-skinned person with long blonde hair running on a grassy field. This individual is wearing a black and pink short-sleeved football jersey, black shorts, long black socks with white accents, and dark athletic shoes. To the runner's left, a light-skinned man with short dark hair and a black headband walks and observes; he is dressed in a pink t-shirt, dark shorts, and white athletic shoes. Standing in a line behind the runner is a group of other young people, also wearing the same black and pink football uniforms. Later in the video, the runner is seen interacting with a large yellow tackle pad held by a man in a dark vest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene is captured from an eye-level perspective on a green grass sports field under an overcast sky. A white line runs across the foreground of the turf. In the background, a large stadium with arched architecture and sections of blue, red, and green seating is visible. Beyond the stadium, a cityscape with several tall buildings and a distant mountain range can be seen. Several people are on the field, including a group of young athletes in black and pink uniforms and a man in a pink shirt. The athletes are performing a drill that involves running and tackling a large, yellow, cylindrical training dummy. Next to the yellow training dummy, there is a man dressed in dark clothing.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins by capturing a runner in full shot, along with several people standing behind her. As the runner starts moving, the camera follows her, tracking her motion. When the runner is close to the camera, it transitions to a medium shot of her; as she moves farther away, it transitions back to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a cyclist in the center foreground, with a woman in a blue dress standing on the far left in the background. A large red balloon is visible in the top right background, partially obscured by a tree. The cyclist is positioned at the same height as the camera, which remains stationary throughout the scene. As the cyclist moves forward toward the center middle ground, the camera briefly zooms in, making the shot size a close-up before returning to a medium shot. The woman in the blue dress remains static, while the red balloon drifts slightly upward and to the right. No other subjects enter or exit the frame, and the spatial arrangement of the elements stays consistent apart from the cyclist’s movement and the brief zoom.",
