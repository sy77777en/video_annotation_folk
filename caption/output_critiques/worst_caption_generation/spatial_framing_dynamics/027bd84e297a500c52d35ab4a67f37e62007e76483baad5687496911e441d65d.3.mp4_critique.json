    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of two Russian nesting dolls, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, a smaller doll with an accordion design is centered in the foreground, while a larger doll with a balalaika design remains hidden behind it in the middle ground. A hand enters from the top right, moving towards the smaller doll. The hand then lifts the smaller doll out of the frame, transitioning it from the center to the top right corner. This action reveals the larger doll, which shifts into the center of the frame. Throughout the video, the background remains a plain white surface, ensuring the focus stays on the dolls. The spatial arrangement changes from having the smaller doll in the foreground to the larger doll taking its place, maintaining the central position. The hand's movement is smooth and deliberate, altering the composition by removing one subject and highlighting another.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a set of Russian nesting dolls, also known as matryoshka dolls. The dolls are painted with traditional designs, including floral patterns and musical instruments, with a blue and white color scheme. The video begins with a slightly smaller Russian nesting doll at the front, featuring an accordion design. A hand then moves this doll out of the frame, revealing a larger nesting doll behind it, decorated with a balalaika design. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features a set of Russian nesting dolls against a plain white background. The focus is on the intricately painted dolls, showcasing vibrant colors and traditional designs. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a single ceramic teapot placed in the upper right section of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The camera is positioned slightly above the teapot, angling downward. In the lower left foreground, a small stack of colorful macarons is visible, partially cropped by the edge of the frame. A spoon enters from the bottom center and gently taps the side of the teapot, causing the lid to tilt and reveal steam rising. The macarons remain stationary throughout, while the teapot shifts slightly toward the center as the lid moves. The background is a patterned blue tablecloth, providing contrast to the main elements. The spatial arrangement transitions from a static composition to a subtle movement of the teapot lid, with the camera maintaining its elevated perspective.",
