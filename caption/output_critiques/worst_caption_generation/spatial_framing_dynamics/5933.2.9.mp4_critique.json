    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of the man, focusing on his upper body and head as he walks through the field. He is positioned in the center of the frame, with the tall grasses surrounding him in the foreground and middle ground. The grasses extend from the bottom left to the top right, creating a dense, textured environment around him. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, capturing more of the man's body while maintaining his central position. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, providing a consistent perspective. The background features leafless trees and a partly cloudy sky, situated at the top of the frame. The man moves steadily forward, and the camera follows his movement, keeping him centered as he navigates through the field. The spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the man and the expansive natural setting, highlighting his journey through the grassy terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with short, dark hair, seen from behind as he walks through a field of tall, dry grasses. He is wearing a brown jacket and carries a large, beige backpack with multiple compartments. The backpack has a rectangular patch on the back. The man appears to be moving forward, surrounded by the swaying grasses, which are light brown and reach up to his shoulders. The scene conveys a sense of exploration or journey through a natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a field of tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through a partly cloudy sky, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the background, leafless trees form a dark silhouette against the sky, suggesting a season of late autumn or early winter. The grasses are slender and topped with feathery plumes, adding texture to the landscape. A person with a backpack is present, moving through the field, their back to the viewer, which adds a sense of scale and direction to the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with a focus on the interaction between the person and the expansive, serene environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a group of children sitting in a circle on a playground, occupying the lower center of the frame in the foreground. The playground equipment, including a large red slide and swings, is visible in the background, stretching from the left to the right edges of the frame. The children remain mostly stationary, with a few shifting slightly within the circle, while a small dog runs from the bottom right to the top left in the middle ground. The camera is positioned slightly above the children’s eye level, looking down at the scene. As the video continues, the shot slowly zooms in to a close-up of the dog as it pauses near the center, with the children now partially out of frame at the edges. The camera maintains its elevated angle throughout, providing a clear view of the playground layout and the spatial relationship between the children, the dog, and the equipment. The transition between the wide shot and the close-up is a gradual zoom, emphasizing the movement of the dog across the playground.",
