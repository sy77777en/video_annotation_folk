    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a full shot captures a teal sedan positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The car is surrounded by several men on a cracked pavement that fills the background. At the top of the frame, a curb is visible in the background. Three men are positioned on the car's hood in the top-center of the frame. To the center-left, another man stands beside the open driver's door, while a fifth man is seated inside the car. In the center-right and bottom-right of the frame, two more men lean over the passenger side of the vehicle. The entire scene is static, with only minor movements from the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high, top-down perspective, a teal sedan with a sunroof is surrounded by several men. Three men are sitting on the hood of the car, with two facing the camera, both dressed in dark clothing. The man on the left is wearing a gold bracelet on his right hand and is smoking a cigarette with his left hand. Another man, with his back to the camera, is wearing a dark blue hooded jacket. To the left of the smoking man, a man in dark clothing and red-and-white sneakers stands beside the open car door, holding his hands up to the sides of his head. To his left, another man is seated inside the car, though details about him are not clearly visible. On the opposite side of the car, two men are leaning over the vehicle. The man on the right, whose clothing shows red on the inside, is outside the car giving a high-five to the smoking man. Their attention is not directed towards the car’s interior.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, an outdoor scene is captured on a cracked, light-gray paved surface during the daytime. A teal sedan with a sunroof is positioned diagonally in the shot, with its driver-side doors open. Several people wearing dark jackets are gathered around and on top of the car. The ground is weathered, and a concrete curb is visible along the top edge of the scene. The lighting is even and diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The truck’s cab is on the left side of the frame, while its cargo area extends to the right. In the background, a row of bicycles is lined up along a fence that runs parallel to the top edge of the frame. Two people stand near the back of the truck on the right, facing away from the camera, while another person is visible through the windshield, seated in the driver’s seat. The camera remains at ground level throughout, and the subjects are mostly stationary, with only slight movement from the people near the truck.",
