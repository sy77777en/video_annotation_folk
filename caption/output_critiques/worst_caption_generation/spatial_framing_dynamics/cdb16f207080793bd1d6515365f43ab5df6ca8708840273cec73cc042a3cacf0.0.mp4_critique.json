    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot of a city harbor. The frame is filled with dark water in the foreground and middle ground, where several clusters of fishing boats are positioned in the bottom left and center-right. A few smaller boats move slowly across the water. In the background, a modern city skyline stretches across the horizon, featuring a prominent reddish-brown building on the left and a group of tall, light-colored skyscrapers on the right. The camera slowly ascends and moves forward, causing a small patch of land initially in the bottom right corner to exit the frame, which expands the view of the water and the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing a tranquil harbor at dusk against the backdrop of a modern metropolis. At the start, a small section of beach is visible in the lower right corner of the frame, adding a touch of natural beauty to the scene. The foreground is a calm body of water dotted with numerous small fishing boats, some clustered in groups while others move slowly across the surface. As the camera tilts upward, the beach area disappears, revealing a prominent skyline in the distance. Several tall, sleek skyscrapers pierce the hazy, pale sky, emphasizing the juxtaposition of traditional maritime life with contemporary architecture. The elevated, static perspective conveys the overall atmosphere and scale of the urban waterfront.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a wide view of a coastal city harbor at dusk. The scene features a large body of dark, rippling water dotted with numerous boats, many of which are clustered together in small groups. In the background, a modern city skyline with several tall, light-colored skyscrapers and a prominent reddish-brown building rises against a pale, lightly clouded sky. A curved coastline with a pier separates the water from the urban landscape, while a few small boats move slowly across the water's surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up, eye-level shot of a single cyclist riding along a narrow mountain path. The cyclist is positioned in the lower center of the frame and occupies the foreground, while a dense forest fills the middle ground, stretching from the left to the right edges. As the camera slowly tracks backward, the cyclist remains centered but gradually becomes smaller in the frame, revealing more of the winding path that curves toward the top left. In the background, a waterfall appears in the upper right corner, partially obscured by trees. The camera maintains a consistent height, parallel to the cyclist’s head, and the shot size transitions from a medium close-up to a wide shot as the scene expands to show the surrounding landscape. No other people or vehicles are visible throughout the video.",
