    "pre_caption": "In this extreme wide shot, the scene is framed from a low angle, looking up between two tall buildings. A building on the left extends from the bottom to the top of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, while another building occupies the top right. In the background, the cloudy night sky fills the center and top of the frame, with the moon positioned in the top center. A small, silhouetted animated cat is located in the top center of the frame, in the middle ground, balancing on a thin wire that stretches diagonally across the upper portion of the scene. The cat takes a small step along the wire. The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated cat with grey fur and a grey tail, with its belly, hands, and feet being white, is seen from a worm's eye view, balancing on a thin wire stretched high between the buildings in the air. The cat holds a long, thin object resembling a slender rod to keep balance. Its inner ears are pink, and the scene unfolds against a cloudy night sky illuminated by a bright moon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's eye view looking up between two tall, multi-story buildings, the scene is set at night. The dark, cloudy sky is illuminated by a bright moon, which is partially obscured by clouds. Two thin steel wires are stretched high across the gap between the buildings. The building facades feature numerous windows, some of which are lit from inside. Small, light raindrops fall down through the air. An animated cat is visible on the wire against the moonlit sky.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

A large fountain occupies the center of the frame in the foreground, with water jets reaching up toward the middle ground. On the right side, a group of people is gathered near the edge of the fountain, positioned in the bottom right and middle ground. Several bicycles are parked along the left edge of the frame, extending from the bottom left to the center in the background.
