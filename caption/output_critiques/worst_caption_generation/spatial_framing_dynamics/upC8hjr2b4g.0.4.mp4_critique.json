    "pre_caption": "A shoulder-up shot frames a humanoid figure in the left foreground, positioned at eye level with the camera. The figure looks toward a closed white door located in the center background. To the right of the door, a light switch is visible on the wall in the background, while a wooden floor occupies the bottom of the frame. The focus then shifts from the humanoid figure to the door, causing the figure in the foreground to become slightly blurry while the door in the background comes into sharp focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a humanoid figure, resembling a young boy, positioned on the left side of the frame. The figure has short, curly black hair and is wearing a blue shirt. Its skin is a pale, light-bluish color, and its face is featureless, giving it a mannequin-like appearance. The figure is shown from a front-side profile, looking over its left shoulder. Initially, the figure is in sharp focus, but the focus then shifts to a white door in the background, rendering the humanoid figure slightly blurry.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit room, bathed in a cool, blue-toned light. A closed, white, paneled interior door with a dark lever handle is positioned in the background. The surrounding walls are a lighter shade of blue-gray, contrasted by white baseboards and a white light switch plate visible to the right of the door. A wooden floor with a herringbone pattern is visible at the bottom of the scene. In the foreground, a figure with black hair is seen from a front-side profile, looking towards the closed door. Small light spots are visible on the door.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a humanoid subject inside an indoor room, with their shoulder-up body visible and in focus on the left side of the frame. The focus then shifts to the door behind the subject in the center of the frame, causing the humanoid subject to become slightly blurry.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "A medium shot shows a large potted plant centered in the foreground, with its leaves extending toward the top left and top right corners of the frame. Behind the plant, a tall window occupies the middle ground, stretching across the entire width of the frame. A small table with a glass vase sits in the bottom right foreground. The camera is positioned slightly above the plant, angling downward. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly pans to the left, bringing a bookshelf in the background into view on the left side of the frame, while the plant and table gradually move out of the shot.",
