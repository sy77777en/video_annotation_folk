    "pre_caption": "This wide shot frames a large die positioned in the center of the middle ground within a narrow room. The die then breaks apart, and its pieces scatter across the floor. The fragments come to rest in the middle ground, clustered in the center and extending toward the bottom right of the frame, with one piece landing closer in the foreground on the right. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, dark taupe, six-sided die with black dots, positioned closer to the back of the room and near the right wall on a wooden floor in a narrow, blue-walled room. The die is initially intact, showcasing its traditional cubic shape and distinct dot pattern. As the video progresses, the die breaks apart into several smaller cube shapes, scattered across the floor. These pieces retain the die's original color and dot pattern. The room's simple design and the die's transformation are the primary focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a small, narrow indoor room with blue walls and a wooden floor. The room is lit by a soft, ambient light, creating a natural atmosphere. The central visual element is a large, white cube with black circular markings resembling a die, positioned on the floor. The cube appears solid and smooth. As the video progresses, the cube breaks apart into smaller, irregularly shaped pieces scattered across the floor, revealing a wooden texture inside. The scene maintains a minimalist style with no additional furniture or decorations. Overlay elements include a white mouse cursor resembling a small hand at the center of the screen, which is not part of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
