    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a group of six people stands in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of a vast, snowy landscape. Behind them, also in the middle ground, are several large, snow-covered trees, with a smaller, similar tree located to their left. The foreground is an expanse of untouched snow. In the distant background, faint outlines of mountains are visible through the mist. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly zooms out, causing the group and the trees to become smaller within the frame and revealing more of the expansive, snowy environment around them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of six people, four men and two women, stand together in a snowy landscape, raising and outstretching their arms to pose. The group is arranged in two rows, with the four men in the back and the two women in front. On the far left, a man with a beard wears a red hooded jacket and black pants. In front of and to his left, a woman in a dark jacket, black pants, and a gray beanie stands. In the center, a man with a beard and dark hair wears a dark jacket. Slightly in front of and to his left, a woman in a red jacket and dark pants stands. Behind and to her left, a man in a yellow top is positioned. On the far right, a man in a dark jacket and pants completes the group. Behind them, several trees with branches heavily covered in white snow droop downwards, with two large trees being most prominent. A smaller, similarly snow-covered tree stands to the left of the main group of trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors in a snowy landscape during daytime, with a group of people initially positioned closer to the right side of the frame, gradually moving to the center as the camera arcs. They stand on a thick blanket of snow, surrounded by several tall trees with branches heavily coated in white snow, forming intricate, frosted shapes. The background features a misty, pale sky and faint outlines of distant mountains, contributing to a cold, wintry atmosphere. The ground is uniformly covered in snow, with no visible paths or structures, and the overall color palette is dominated by whites and muted grays. The group's winter clothing adds small accents of color against the otherwise monochromatic setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To their right, in the middle ground, a large fountain is visible, with water spraying upward and catching the light. Several bicycles are parked in the background near the top right of the frame, partially obscured by leafy green bushes. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, looking down at them, and slowly tilts upward to reveal more of the treetops and a clear blue sky, while the people remain stationary throughout the shot.",
