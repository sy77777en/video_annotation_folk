    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man who occupies most of the frame. Initially, he is positioned slightly off-center to the left, facing towards the right side of the frame. As the video progresses, he moves horizontally across the frame from left to right, maintaining a consistent distance from the camera. The man remains in the foreground throughout, with the large screen in the background serving as a static backdrop. The screen displays text and graphics, including a city skyline silhouette and event branding, which remain in the upper portion of the frame. The camera maintains a steady position at the subject's eye level, capturing his upper body and head as he moves. There are no significant changes in the camera angle or height, ensuring the subject stays centered and prominent in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium-dark skin tone, wearing a very pale purple dress shirt that is almost white. He has a bald head, dark eyes, and a small amount of facial hair above his mouth, and is speaking into a headset microphone. His posture is upright, and he appears to be engaged in delivering a talk or presentation. The man is positioned prominently in the foreground, facing slightly to the side, suggesting he is addressing an audience. The background includes a screen displaying text and graphics, indicating a formal or professional setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors, likely in a conference or lecture setting. The environment features a stage with a large screen displaying text and graphics, including a city skyline silhouette and event branding. The lighting is focused on the stage, creating a contrast between the illuminated speaker and the darker background. The speaker is positioned prominently, wearing a light-colored shirt and using a headset microphone. The setting suggests a formal presentation atmosphere, with the screen providing visual context and information related to the event.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a group of four people standing in a park, all positioned in the center of the frame and spaced evenly from left to right. The subjects are shown in full body, occupying the foreground, while a row of tall trees fills the background across the upper half of the frame. Throughout the video, the group remains stationary, but a large dog enters from the bottom right foreground and moves diagonally toward the center, stopping near the group. The camera is set at a low angle, slightly below the subjects’ waist height, looking upward. There are no changes in shot size or camera height, and the spatial arrangement of the people and dog remains consistent after the initial movement.",
