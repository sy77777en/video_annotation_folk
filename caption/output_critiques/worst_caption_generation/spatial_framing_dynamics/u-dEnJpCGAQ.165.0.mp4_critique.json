    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a large group of elephants in a shallow river, with the camera positioned above them. The elephants are distributed across the frame, primarily occupying the middle ground, with some extending into the foreground. They are oriented towards the left side of the frame, suggesting movement or attention in that direction. The river, with its smooth, light-colored rocks, forms the background, while green vegetation is visible on the far bank. The elephants vary in size, indicating a mix of adults and juveniles, and their positioning creates a dynamic composition as they wade through the water. The camera maintains a consistent height and angle throughout, capturing the scene from an elevated perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large group of elephants standing and wading in a shallow body of water. The elephants vary in size, indicating a mix of adults and juveniles. Their skin is predominantly gray with some areas appearing darker due to harsh shadows from the strong sunlight. All the elephants are facing the same direction, towards the left side of the frame, as they are drinking water and bathing in the shallow river. Their trunks are either hanging down or slightly raised, and their ears are relaxed. The scene conveys a sense of a natural gathering in a serene setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a herd of elephants wading in a wide, shallow river during the daytime. The elephants, varying in size and shades of greyish-brown, some with patches of reddish-brown dust on their backs, are dispersed throughout the flowing water. The river is characterized by numerous large, smooth, light-colored rocks, both submerged and exposed, forming the riverbed and banks. Green vegetation is visible on the far bank.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The giraffe is centered in the frame and occupies the middle ground, while the lower section of the frame shows scattered seashells in the foreground. In the background, the ocean stretches across the upper half of the frame, with gentle waves visible near the top right. The camera remains steady throughout, maintaining a consistent height and angle as the giraffe slowly turns its head from left to right. No other animals or people are present in the scene.",
