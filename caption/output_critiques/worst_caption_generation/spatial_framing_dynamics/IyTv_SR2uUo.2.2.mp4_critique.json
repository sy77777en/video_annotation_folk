    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames a kayaker from a third-person perspective, positioned in the center foreground. The camera is mounted behind the subject, looking over their shoulders and the bow of their pink kayak, which occupies the bottom center of the frame. The kayaker paddles forward through whitewater, flanked by the tree-lined, rocky walls of a gorge in the middle ground on the left and right. As the kayaker goes over a waterfall, their position in the frame remains centered, but they move rapidly downward. The camera, locked in position behind them, tilts down, following the descent and shifting the view from a forward perspective to one looking directly down into the churning water at the base of the falls. The gorge walls appear to rise up on either side as the kayaker drops deeper into the canyon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is shown from a first-person perspective, kayaking down a narrow, rocky waterfall. The kayaker wears red and yellow kayaking attire. On their head is a silver helmet with a Red Bull logo on the side and a small camera mounted on top. They are actively paddling with a paddle that has a black shaft and black blades with a yellow pattern. The kayak they are in is bright pink with various logos visible on the front.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot fixed to the subject, the perspective is of a descent down a turbulent river confined within a narrow, rocky gorge. The steep walls of the gorge are dark and shadowed, with dense green trees and foliage lining the sunlit banks above. The view looks over the bow of a pink kayak as it navigates through churning whitewater, culminating in a drop over a waterfall into the frothing water below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts at the subject. When the subject falls down the waterfall, the camera is above the subject since the camera being locked-on the back of the raft. ",

  "bad_caption": "A medium shot frames a cyclist from a side angle, positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The camera is set at street level, parallel to the subject, capturing the cyclist as they ride along a paved city street lined with parked cars and storefronts that stretch into the background on both sides. The cyclist moves steadily from right to left across the frame, while pedestrians appear briefly in the left foreground, walking in the opposite direction. As the cyclist approaches a crosswalk, the camera pans slightly to follow their movement, keeping them in the right third of the frame. The camera remains at the same height as the cyclist throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective as the scene unfolds.",
