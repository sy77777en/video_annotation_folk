    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme close-up shot, with the camera positioned above the subjects. A pair of light-skinned hands occupies the foreground, positioned centrally within the frame. These hands hold and manipulate a light blue watch band, which is also in the foreground and serves as the central point of focus. The band is initially shown with its wavy edges and circular side holes facing the camera, then it is slightly rotated and flexed, revealing its top and bottom oval-shaped holes, while remaining in the central foreground. In the blurred background, a few colorful, thin, cylindrical objects are visible in the top left corner. A darker object is situated in the top right background, and what appear to be additional white bands are located in the bottom-center background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds and flexes a light blue, matte-finished band. The band features a distinctive wavy or scalloped edge on both sides. Along the edges, there is a series of small, dark, circular holes, while the top and bottom of the band have more oval-shaped holes. The hands manipulate the band, demonstrating its flexibility.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot, where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, shows a pair of hands holding and flexing a light blue, perforated watch band. The band has a distinctive wavy, scalloped edge and features a series of small, circular holes running along its length. In the blurred background, a few colorful, thin, cylindrical objects are visible in the upper left corner, along with a darker object in the top-right corner and what seem to be additional white bands in the bottom-center of the frame. The scene is brightly lit, focusing on the texture and flexibility of the watch band.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The video would be more accurately described as a close-up shot rather than an extreme close-up, as the focus is not solely on the watch band; other elements are also present in the frame.\n2. The description of the objects in the top left as cylindrical is not clear, so it would be better to omit this detail.

A single dark-skinned hand is visible on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, holding a small red toy car. The car is oriented diagonally, with its front facing toward the bottom left corner of the frame. In the background, a green notebook is placed horizontally along the top edge, while a yellow pencil lies parallel to the notebook on the left side. Throughout the video, the hand slowly moves the toy car from right to left across the frame, maintaining a consistent height relative to the camera. No significant changes in shot size or camera angle occur during the scene.",
