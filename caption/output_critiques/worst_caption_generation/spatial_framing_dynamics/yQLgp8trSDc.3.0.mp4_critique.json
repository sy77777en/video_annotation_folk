    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle wide shot, showing a group of men at the top of a set of stairs in the middle ground, with a large temple occupying the background. The main subject, a man in white, is positioned in the center of the frame, flanked by men in yellow robes to his left and right. As the group moves forward down the stairs toward the camera, the shot transitions into a medium shot, tightening the frame on the central figure. In the final composition, the man in white remains in the center, now seen from the waist up, while the men beside him are partially visible on the left and right edges of the frame, all maintaining their position in the middle ground as they advance. The camera remains positioned below the subjects throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of individuals in traditional attire, with the main focus on a man in the center. He is wearing a white robe with a black belt and has long, light-colored hair styled in a topknot, along with a long, light-colored beard. His expression is serious, and he stands prominently in the middle ground. Surrounding him are several men dressed in yellow and black robes, wearing black hats. They appear to be accompanying or following the main subject. The setting suggests a traditional or historical context, with architectural elements visible in the background. The group is positioned on steps, indicating a hierarchical or formal arrangement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor scene set in front of a traditional East Asian temple, characterized by its ornate, curved roof and intricate architectural details. The setting is during the day, with clear skies providing ample natural light. Stone statues flank the entrance, adding a sense of grandeur and historical significance. The temple's structure is made of dark wood, contrasting with the light stone steps leading up to it. A man dressed in white traditional attire leads a group of people, some wearing yellow and black robes and others in gray and black robes, as they run on flat ground at the top level of the stairs. The environment is calm, with no visible movement or weather effects, emphasizing the temple's serene and timeless atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

She is positioned in the foreground, while several children playing with balloons are scattered across the middle ground, mostly on the left and top left of the frame. As the camera slowly pans left, the woman stands and walks toward the left edge, moving from the bottom right to the bottom left of the frame, while the children remain in their positions. The camera maintains a slightly elevated height above the subjects throughout the scene, providing a clear view of the fountain and the surrounding plaza.",
