    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a young man, capturing him from the shoulders up. He is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the frame, occupying the foreground. The background consists of an indoor setting with neutral-colored walls and minimal decor, situated in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the sequence. Initially, the man has his eyes closed, and as the frames progress, he opens his eyes and looks directly towards the camera. There is no significant change in the shot size or the subject's position within the frame. The lighting is soft, enhancing the subject's facial features without altering the spatial dynamics. The text \"而是这一刻\" appears briefly at the bottom of the frame, maintaining the focus on the subject's contemplative state. The camera angle and height remain constant, ensuring a steady and direct view of the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with short dark hair and a light skin tone. He is wearing a dark blue shirt and is captured in a close-up view, focusing on his face. His expression is neutral, with his eyes closed initially and then open, suggesting a moment of contemplation or thoughtfulness. The lighting is soft, highlighting his facial features and creating a calm atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with subdued lighting, suggesting a calm, introspective atmosphere. The environment appears to be a room with neutral-colored walls and minimal decor, focusing on a person who is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the frame. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the person's contemplative expression. The time of day is indeterminate due to the controlled indoor lighting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a detached, observational perspective. Overlay elements include the text \"而是这一刻,\" which briefly appears in the lower left corner of the frame during the video and then disappears, positioned unobtrusively within the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a city park, with several people jogging from left to right across the middle ground. The main group of joggers is positioned in the center of the frame, while a cyclist appears briefly in the bottom right foreground before exiting the shot. In the background, tall trees and a playground structure are visible, occupying the top left and top center portions of the frame. The camera is set at a low angle, slightly below the subjects’ waist height, giving an upward perspective on the scene. Throughout the sequence, the camera slowly pans to the right, following the movement of the joggers and revealing more of the park landscape. No significant changes in shot size occur, but the spatial arrangement of the subjects shifts as they move across the frame. A digital clock overlay appears momentarily in the top right corner, indicating the time of day. The camera maintains its low position relative to the moving subjects for the duration of the video.",
