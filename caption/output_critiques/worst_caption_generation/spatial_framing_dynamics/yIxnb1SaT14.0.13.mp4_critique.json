    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to frame the entire cityscape, with the Arc de Triomphe positioned centrally in the frame and occupying the middle ground. The monument stands upright, extending from the lower center to the upper center of the image, with its base near the bottom edge and its top approaching the upper edge. The circular roadway encircling the Arc is visible in the foreground, where streaks of red, white, and yellow lights from moving vehicles form horizontal and curved lines, especially prominent along the bottom and lower right of the frame. The background consists of a dark, cloudy night sky filling the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately street level, at the same height as the base of the Arc, providing a level perspective on the monument. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement throughout the video, and the overlay text \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHIES\" remains fixed in the lower right corner, occupying the foreground in that area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the overall urban atmosphere and the passage of time rather than a specific main subject. The long-exposure technique intentionally abstracts the moving traffic, making the environment itself the primary focus. At the center of the composition stands the Arc de Triomphe, its light-colored stone facade and intricate sculptural details brightly illuminated against a dark, cloudy night sky. Encircling the base of the monumental arch are fluid streaks of red, white, and yellow light from the traffic, creating a vibrant sense of motion that contrasts with the timeless stillness of the historic landmark.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows the Arc de Triomphe in Paris at night, standing prominently in an open urban setting with a dark sky and scattered clouds overhead. The monument is constructed from light-colored stone, featuring detailed carvings and sculptural reliefs on its facades, with strong artificial lighting illuminating its surfaces and casting defined shadows. Surrounding the Arc, blurred streaks of red, white, and yellow lights from moving vehicles create dynamic lines along the circular roadway, indicating continuous traffic flow. In the lower right corner, an overlay displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIC PHOTOGRAPHIES\" in white, which is not part of the scene itself. The overall environment is calm, with the monument sharply contrasted against the night sky and the motion of city life around it.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject’s upper body and face are clearly visible, with their hands resting on an open book that lies flat on the desk. To the right of the subject, a small potted plant sits near the edge of the desk, also in the foreground. Behind the subject, a large window fills most of the background, showing a bright daytime sky and the tops of nearby trees. The camera is set at eye level with the seated subject, providing a straight-on perspective. Throughout the video, the subject occasionally leans forward or turns a page, but the shot size and spatial arrangement remain consistent. A digital clock overlay is fixed in the upper left corner of the frame.",
