    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a hawksbill sea turtle positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, swimming over a sandy seafloor. The turtle is surrounded by various coral formations that occupy the middle ground and background, with a prominent brain coral visible in the bottom right foreground. The turtle slowly swims forward and to the right, moving from the center toward the right side of the frame. The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A hawksbill sea turtle is shown swimming in an underwater environment. Its carapace, or upper shell, has a mottled pattern of brown, amber, and black. The turtle's head and flippers are covered in a distinct, scale-like pattern of black and a lighter, yellowish-white color. It is positioned over a sandy seafloor populated with various types of coral, including branching corals and a prominent, yellowish brain coral with a maze-like texture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An underwater scene unfolds on a sunlit coral reef, where a large sea turtle with a dark, mottled shell swims slowly over the sandy ocean floor. The turtle's head and flippers are covered in a distinct black-and-white geometric pattern. The surrounding environment is a vibrant ecosystem filled with various coral formations, including tan branching corals and convoluted, yellow-green brain corals. Sunlight penetrates the clear blue water, casting shifting light patterns across the seabed.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

A large starfish is visible in the top right background, partially obscured by the grass. As the clownfish move upward and toward the center, the camera tilts slightly downward to follow their movement, causing the starfish to shift toward the top center background. The camera remains at eye level with the clownfish throughout the scene.",
