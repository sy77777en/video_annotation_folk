    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle above the subject, initially frames a small, hooded character in the center of the screen and in the middle ground. A log cabin occupies the background, with a stone path leading from its central door toward the foreground. A white picket fence is visible in the background on the left and right sides of the cabin, with a small garden plot in the bottom right. The character then walks from the center towards the bottom left of the frame. Throughout the shot, UI elements are positioned at the bottom of the screen: a coin icon in the bottom left, an inventory bar in the bottom center, and two status bars in the bottom right. The camera remains stationary throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a character with an atypical appearance, wearing a gray-blue hooded cloak and having a round, orange face with circular eyes and a line-like mouth. The character is walking along a path made of stones. The setting includes a wooden house with visible windows and a door, and a fenced area with plants. The character's movement suggests a journey or exploration within this environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A 2.5D game video shows a scene set at dusk in the yard of a log cabin, rendered in a stylized, cartoonish art style with thick black outlines. The single-story wooden house has a warm, reddish light glowing from its open door and windows. A path made of flat, round stones leads from the door across a grassy yard, which is partially enclosed by a white picket fence and contains small, tilled garden plots. A small, hooded character with a smiling face walks from the front of the house toward the left side of the screen. On-screen overlays include a coin icon with the number 160 in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom center, and two vertical status bars in the bottom-right corner, one of which is partially filled with a blue liquid.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

A large stone fountain occupies the center background, with a wooden bridge extending from the fountain toward the top left of the frame. A row of red banners is visible in the background along the top edge of the scene. As the armored figure walks to the right, he moves out of the frame, and the camera remains stationary. A small flock of birds appears in the top right corner after the figure leaves. Throughout the shot, UI elements are displayed at the top of the screen: a health bar in the top left, a map in the top center, and a quest log in the top right. The camera does not move during the clip.",
