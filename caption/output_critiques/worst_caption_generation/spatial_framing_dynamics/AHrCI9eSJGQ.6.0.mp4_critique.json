    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle perspective on a container ship. In the foreground, stacks of shipping containers fill the bottom half of the frame, positioned from the bottom left to the bottom right. The sea occupies the middle ground in the center of the frame. In the background, a hazy coastline with mountains, a city, and a bridge is visible along the horizon. The sky fills the top half of the frame. A watermark is located in the bottom right corner. The camera remains static, capturing the scene from a fixed high vantage point looking forward over the bow of the ship.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a wide-angle seascape scenery shot captured from the bow of a massive container ship. Stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers fill the lower portion of the frame, leading the eye forward as the vessel moves through calm, dark blue waters. In the distance, small boats are visible, adding to the overall maritime scene, along with a hazy coastline featuring low-lying mountains and a faint city skyline, including a long-span bridge, on the horizon under a vast, bright blue sky that fades to white at the top. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is on conveying the immense scale of the maritime environment and the feeling of a journey across the open sea, using the ship as a framing device to emphasize the vastness of the surrounding seascape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on the bow of a container ship, the scene looks forward over stacks of rectangular shipping containers, colored predominantly red and blue, as the ship moves forward and slightly to the right. The ship is situated on a wide body of calm, dark water, where smaller vessels are visible, and a cluster of ships is anchored in the distance to the right. In the hazy distance, a mountainous landmass, a city skyline, and a long bridge are visible under a deep blue sky with white clouds on the left, gradually transitioning to a bright, hazy area on the right. Sunlight in the upper right corner of the frame casts a soft, pale pink hue near the horizon. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a YouTube logo and the text 'JEFFHK'.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject is positioned slightly to the left, facing toward the right side of the frame, with their upper body and head visible. Behind the person, a row of tall bookshelves fills the middle ground, extending from the left to the right edge of the frame. In the background, large windows occupy the top half of the frame, revealing a city skyline outside. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent low angle below the subject’s eye level. No other people or moving elements are present, and a small digital clock is visible in the top right corner.",
