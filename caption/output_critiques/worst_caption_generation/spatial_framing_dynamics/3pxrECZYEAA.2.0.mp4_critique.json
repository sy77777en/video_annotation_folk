    "pre_caption": "This wide shot opens with a green, tadpole-like creature positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame, situated between dark, finger-like seaweed structures that occupy both the foreground and middle ground. To the right, a red, circular object is also visible in the middle ground. As the scene progresses, the tadpole swims horizontally to the left, weaving between the seaweed stalks, while the red circle simultaneously drifts to the right and exits the frame. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a stylized, animated green tadpole-like creature with a smooth, elongated body and a prominent yellow eye with a red pupil. The creature is depicted weaving through dark, abstract plant-like shapes. Its body is sleek and streamlined, with a subtle gradient that adds depth. The yellow eye is striking against the green body, drawing attention to the creature's head. The tadpole's movement through the plants suggests a sense of fluidity and grace. The scene begins with the creature next to a red, egg-like circle before it swims away to the left. The overall scene is characterized by its bold colors and simple, graphic style.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated underwater setting with a dark blue background, dark green, finger-like seaweed structures rise from below. A small, green, tadpole-like creature with large red eyes swims slowly through the aquatic plants. To the right, a round, red object with a textured, bubbly surface gradually moves off the screen as the scene progresses.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

In the middle ground, a brown squirrel is visible near the center, partially obscured by leaves. As the scene continues, the bird hops upward and toward the center, while the camera tilts slightly downward to follow its movement. The squirrel remains stationary, and the blue flowers gradually move out of view as the camera shifts. The camera is positioned slightly above the bird’s height throughout the shot.",
