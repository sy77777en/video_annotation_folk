    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of an underwater scene, showcasing a coral reef structure prominently positioned at the center of the frame. The coral formation occupies the middle ground, with its rough textures and varied colors contrasting against the deep blue water that fills the background. Numerous small fish are dispersed throughout the frame, swimming in various directions, primarily in the foreground and middle ground, creating a sense of movement and dynamism. The sandy ocean floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, providing a base for the coral and enhancing the overall spatial composition. The camera is positioned at the height of the coral, allowing for a clear view of both the reef and the surrounding marine life. As the video progresses, the framing remains consistent, maintaining the coral at the center while the fish move around it, emphasizing the lively underwater ecosystem.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an underwater scenery shot. It focuses on the vibrant marine environment, highlighting the rich blue water and a coral formation at the center. The coral is surrounded by numerous small, colorful fish swimming in various directions, creating a dynamic and lively atmosphere. The emphasis is on the ecosystem's beauty and scale, rather than a specific object, showcasing the harmony and diversity of underwater life.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an underwater scene in a clear, vibrant ocean environment. The setting features a coral reef structure at the center, composed of various corals with rough textures and a mix of green and brown hues. Surrounding the reef, numerous small fish swim in different directions, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The water is a deep blue, providing a striking contrast to the lighter sandy ocean floor. The lighting suggests a bright, sunlit day, with sunlight filtering through the water, enhancing the visibility and colors of the marine life. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, highlighting the beauty of the underwater ecosystem.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a bustling city street, with a large red double-decker bus occupying the center of the frame in the foreground. Pedestrians are visible on the left and right edges of the frame, walking along the sidewalks in the middle ground, while tall glass buildings rise in the background, filling the upper portion of the image. Streetlights and traffic signals are positioned at the top right and top left corners, extending into the background. The camera is set at street level, matching the height of the bus and pedestrians, providing a direct view of the urban environment. Throughout the video, the bus remains stationary at the center, while people cross the street from left to right, and cars occasionally pass behind the bus, creating a layered sense of depth and movement. The framing stays consistent, keeping the bus as the focal point while the activity unfolds around it.",
