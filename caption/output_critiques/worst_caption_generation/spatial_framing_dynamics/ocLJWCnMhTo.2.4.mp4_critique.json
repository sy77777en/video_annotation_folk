    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, three people are grouped in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The scene is presented upside down, with a black-and-white checkerboard ceiling filling the background. In the middle ground, a round table is located in the top left, and a chair is visible to the left of the central group. The camera then pulls back and rotates clockwise, causing the entire scene and the subjects to recede and spin within the frame. As the camera moves, the subjects shift from the center towards the top of the frame, and the shot widens to reveal more of the background, including a wall with glass blocks and framed pictures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a scene captured from a camera craning upwards, three people are grouped in the center. One person, positioned on the right, wears a bright red long-sleeved shirt and grey pants, holding the child in the middle. The second individual, being held in the middle, is dressed in a green top and white shorts, and is also wearing red socks and brown shoes. The third person, clad in a white shirt, stands on the left, appearing to support the child in the middle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is captured from a bird's-eye view, with the camera craning upward to create a disorienting effect. The ceiling features a black and white checkerboard pattern. Visible in the scene are a light-colored, round table and a simple chair. The walls are partially visible, showing a section of glass blocks and framed pictures. The scene is presented with a grainy, vintage film quality and is framed by black borders on the left and right sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

A large window fills the background, with sunlight streaming in from the top left. A potted plant is positioned in the bottom center of the frame, partially obscuring the subjects’ legs. The camera slowly dollies forward, bringing the subjects closer to the center while the window shifts toward the left background. Throughout the movement, the people turn their heads to face each other, and the plant remains stationary. No other objects or elements enter or exit the frame during the shot.",
