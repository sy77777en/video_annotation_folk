    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focusing on the lower body of a person on the right side of the frame, wearing blue shorts, colorful socks, and black sneakers. The golf club and ball are positioned in the foreground, with the ball on a small green and black mat. On the left side, three eggs are arranged on stands in the middle ground. The camera is at the subject's level, capturing the action as the person swings the club. The golf ball moves from the right to the left, striking the eggs, which are in the middle ground, causing them to break and scatter their contents. The club and ball exit the frame to the left, leaving behind broken eggshells and yolk on the ground. The background features a low brick wall and green trees, providing a static backdrop to the dynamic action in the foreground and middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person wearing blue shorts, colorful socks, and black sneakers, positioned on the right side, swinging a golf club. The focus is on their lower body, with the golf club directly in front of them and the golf ball positioned on the right side on the ground. On the left, three eggs are neatly arranged on stands. As the person swings the club, the golf ball is struck and sent towards the eggs, resulting in the eggs breaking and bursting open. The action causes the club and ball to move out of the frame, leaving a scene of broken eggshells and scattered contents.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from an objective POV, is set outdoors on a paved, pinkish-tan surface during a sunny day, with a low brick wall and green trees in the background. Initially, three white eggs are balanced on white tees set into a light brown wooden plank. A person, seen from the knees down wearing blue shorts, patterned socks, and dark sneakers, swings a silver golf club, striking the eggs. The impact causes the eggs to explode, scattering white shell fragments and yellow yolk across the plank and the ground. On the right side of the scene, a small green and black mat is positioned, where the golf ball is initially placed.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person hitting a golf ball with a golf club, causing the ball to break three eggs. On the right side of the frame is the person's lower body, along with the golf club and ball. On the left, three neatly arranged eggs are visible. As the person swings the club, the ball hits and breaks the eggs, causing them to burst open, while the club and ball move out of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot capturing a single bicycle parked in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The handlebars and front wheel are angled toward the left side, while the rear wheel extends toward the right. In the foreground, a row of small orange traffic cones is lined up horizontally across the bottom of the frame. Behind the bicycle, a wooden fence runs parallel to the frame, forming the background and stretching from the left to the right edge. The camera is positioned slightly above the height of the bicycle, looking down at a shallow angle. As the video progresses, a person enters from the left, walking behind the bicycle and briefly pausing in the background before exiting to the right. The spatial arrangement remains consistent, with the cones in the foreground, the bicycle in the center middle ground, and the fence and person in the background. No significant changes in shot size or camera height occur throughout the scene.",
