    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a wide view of a river landscape, focusing on the natural environment rather than a specific subject. The fast-flowing river occupies the bottom half of the frame, moving from the background toward the foreground. A rocky bank lined with green trees is positioned in the left middle ground, while a broader, pebble-strewn bank is on the right. In the background, green mountains rise under a blue sky with white clouds that fill the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high angle, slowly ascends and pulls back, transitioning the view into an extreme wide shot that reveals a more expansive perspective of the river and the surrounding mountainous terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a wide, fast-flowing river with white-capped rapids and rocks scattered within the river itself, flanked by rocky riverbanks. On the left bank, a line of green trees and vegetation extends towards distant, hazy mountains and leads up to a steep, tree-covered hill with exposed, lighter-colored patches of earth or rock. The right bank is a broad expanse of lighter-colored rocks and pebbles. The sky above is blue with large, fluffy white cumulus clouds. There is no main subject as the focus is on capturing the expansive natural environment, the dynamic movement of the water, and the overall atmosphere of the scene, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the landscape rather than a particular object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a river with dark, turbulent water and white rapids flowing through flat river plains adjacent to the mountains. Both riverbanks are wide and composed of numerous grey and white rounded stones. A line of green trees follows the left bank, with more dense green vegetation covering the mountains in the background. These mountains, some with lighter-toned, exposed patches of earth or rock, rise under a bright blue sky dotted with large, white, puffy cumulus clouds. The drone gradually ascends, revealing a more expansive view of the river and the surrounding mountainous landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",

The car is positioned in the foreground, with a row of tall apartment buildings stretching along the right side of the frame in the middle ground. On the left, a sidewalk café with several empty tables occupies the bottom left corner in the foreground. In the background, a large digital billboard displays advertisements above the street. The camera is set slightly above the car’s roofline, angled downward, and slowly pans to the left, shifting the car out of view and bringing the café tables into the center of the frame while the buildings remain in the background.",
