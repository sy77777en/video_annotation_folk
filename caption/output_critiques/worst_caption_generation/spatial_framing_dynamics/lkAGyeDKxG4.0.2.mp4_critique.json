    "pre_caption": "In a tilted full shot, a man is silhouetted in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a steep, grassy slope that rises from the bottom left. Dense, blue-toned fog occupies the background. The camera's angle creates the illusion of the man leaning back steeply. He then bends forward and to his left, reaching down to the middle ground to pick up a jacket from the slope. While remaining in the center of the frame, he straightens slightly and puts on the jacket. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with dark, short hair is shown in silhouette on a steep, grassy slope against a backdrop of dense, blue-toned fog. He is dressed in athletic wear, consisting of dark shorts and a dark, long-sleeved top worn over a lighter base layer with a visible orange vertical stripe at the collar. The camera's rotation creates an illusion of tilt, but the character actually bends to the left, picks up a dark jacket from the ground, and puts it on.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a steep, moss-covered hillside under a dense, blue-tinted fog that obscures the background. The low-visibility, pre-dawn environment features a silhouetted figure in athletic wear on the dark, grassy slope. The person is shown putting on a dark jacket.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The background shows a row of tall pine trees stretching across the top of the frame. The camera is positioned slightly above the subject, looking down at her. She raises her right hand to touch the wall, then steps back toward the center of the frame, remaining in the foreground. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot, and no other subjects enter the scene.",
