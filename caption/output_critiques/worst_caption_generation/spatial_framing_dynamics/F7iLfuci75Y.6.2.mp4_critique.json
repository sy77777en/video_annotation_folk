    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a computer monitor, which is centered in the frame. The camera then pulls back, transitioning into a wide shot that reveals the silhouette of a person in the left foreground, sitting in front of the monitor, now positioned in the right-middle ground. As the camera continues its backward movement, the view becomes framed and obscured by what appears to be the vertical gap between two glass panels or blinds. The final composition shows the person and their monitors in the background, visible only through a narrow, clear vertical gap in the center of the screen, while the left and right portions of the frame are blurred. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a computer screen displaying a social media post in dark mode. The post, from a user named AndresFreundTec and dated March 29, discusses the accidental discovery of a security issue and includes a link to an openwall.com article titled \"oss-security - backdoor in upstream xz/liblzm...\". As the view pulls back, a person is revealed sitting in a dimly lit room, seen mostly in silhouette in front of two monitors, one of which is the screen from the opening. The scene is then progressively obscured by the vertical gap between glass window panes or glass door panels. Through the glass between the blurred frames on both sides of the gap, the person and the screens are faintly visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark room, a computer monitor displays a social media post from a user named AndresFreundTec, dated March 29. The post describes the accidental discovery of a security issue and recommends an immediate upgrade for users of \"bleeding edge\" software distributions. Below the text, a link preview for openwall.com shows a title that reads \"oss-security - backdoor in upstream xz/liblzm...\". The screen's interface is dark and monochromatic with light-colored text, serving as one of the main light sources in the unlit space. Another screen with a light interface also serves as a main light source. Overlay text in the bottom left corner of the video reads \"@AndresFreundTec / x.com.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera quickly moves backward, causing the picture to change from a full shot of the computer screen to a wide view of the character looking at two screens, and the video ends up being viewed through the window blinds, which obscure most of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

Behind them, a large tree occupies the center background, with its branches extending toward the top left. To the left of the person, a bicycle is partially visible in the middle ground, its front wheel near the bottom left edge. The camera is angled slightly above the subject’s eye level, looking down. As the scene progresses, the person steps forward toward the center, while the bicycle remains stationary. The framing remains steady throughout, with no significant changes in shot size or camera height.",
