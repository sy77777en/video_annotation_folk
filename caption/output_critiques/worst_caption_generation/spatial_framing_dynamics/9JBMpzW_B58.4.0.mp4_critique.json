    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot captured from the bow of a container ship. The foreground is composed of stacked shipping containers that occupy the bottom half of the frame, extending from the bottom edge toward the center. The sea fills the middle ground, stretching from the center to the horizon line. In the background, the night sky occupies the top half of the frame, and a timelapse sequence shows the stars arcing across the sky. A bright orange glow is visible in the background on the right horizon, with a fainter white light on the left horizon. Two white watermarks are overlaid in the center-right portion of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a stunning seascape scenery shot from the perspective of a large container ship navigating the open ocean. The focus is on the immense scale of the environment and the tranquil atmosphere of a night at sea, rather than on any single subject. The extreme wide view from the bow, looking over stacks of colorful shipping containers, leads the eye across the dark blue, calm water to the distant horizon. Above, the deep night sky is densely packed with brilliant stars, revealing the faint, glowing band of the Milky Way and a distinct constellation, while a warm, orange light from a far-off city illuminates the horizon to the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on the bow of a container ship, the scene looks out over a calm, dark blue sea at night. The vast night sky is a deep blue, filled with a multitude of stars in a timelapse sequence. An orange glow from a distant light source illuminates the horizon on the right, while a fainter white light is visible on the left. In the foreground, rows of stacked shipping containers in various colors, including red, blue, and beige, cover the deck of the vessel. Overlaying the center-right side of the scene are two white watermarks, \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK,\" each accompanied by an icon to their left.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying most of the foreground, with their upper body and head visible. To the left of the subject, a bowl of fruit sits on the counter in the middle ground, while a window with closed blinds is visible in the background, spanning the top right portion of the frame. The subject’s hands move from the counter to a cutting board, and a glass of water is placed at the bottom right foreground. The camera remains stationary at a height just above the subject’s eye level, and no significant spatial movement or transitions occur throughout the shot.",
