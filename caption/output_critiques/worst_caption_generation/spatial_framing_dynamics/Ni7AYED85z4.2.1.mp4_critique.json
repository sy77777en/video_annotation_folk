    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, eye-level scenery shot from a first-person perspective, focusing on the ambiance of a public square populated by pedestrians. Initially, the enclosed patio of a restaurant occupies the right foreground and middle ground, while a cobblestone plaza extends from the bottom-center foreground into the background. In the left foreground, an ornate lamppost is positioned in front of a large stone building that sits in the left middle ground. As the camera moves forward and pans slightly to the left, the restaurant patio on the right recedes from view. The lamppost travels from the left foreground across the frame and exits on the right, bringing the plaza and the stone building into a more central and prominent position by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the ambiance of a European-style public square. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and sense of place rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The camera moves along a cobblestone pavement, passing the enclosed outdoor patio of a restaurant. The patio structure features dark wood framing and large glass windows, through which neatly set dining tables with white tablecloths and wine glasses are visible. In the middle ground, people stroll past a grand, light-colored stone building with prominent columns and steps, while a classic, ornate dark green lamppost stands on the corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a cobblestone plaza in Venice on an overcast day. To the right, a restaurant's enclosed patio features a dark brown wooden frame with large glass windows, revealing tables set with white tablecloths and wine glasses under a red awning. Across the plaza, a large, historic white stone building with prominent columns and steps is visible. An ornate, dark green lamppost stands on a stone base in the middle ground, while pedestrians in casual clothing walk about in both the middle ground and background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot at a slightly high angle, showing a quiet city street lined with parked bicycles. In the center foreground, a large fountain occupies most of the frame, with water visibly spraying upwards. To the right middle ground, a row of market stalls with colorful umbrellas stretches toward the background, while a small group of musicians is seated on benches in the left foreground. As the camera tilts downward and slowly zooms in, the fountain shifts toward the bottom center, and the musicians become more prominent, moving closer to the center of the frame. The market stalls on the right gradually move out of view, and the camera’s height remains above the subjects throughout the shot.",
