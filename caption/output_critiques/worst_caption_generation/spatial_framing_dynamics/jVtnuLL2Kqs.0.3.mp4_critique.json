    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot focused on Buckingham Palace. Initially, the palace's facade is centered in the middle ground, stretching across the frame, with its ornate fence and gates positioned in the foreground. The overcast sky occupies the top portion of the frame in the background. The camera, positioned at a low angle looking up at the building, slowly pulls back and moves slightly to the left. This movement reveals more of the forecourt in the immediate foreground and widens the view of the palace. A time-lapse effect causes the clouds in the background to move rapidly across the sky, while blurred people move through the foreground and middle ground. A static logo is present in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic time-lapse cityscape scenery shot featuring the grand, neoclassical facade of Buckingham Palace. The imposing stone building, complete with its ornate black and gold gates, stands firm under a sky of heavy, grey clouds that sweep rapidly across the frame. This is a scenery shot as the focus is not on any particular person or object, but rather on the monumental scale of the architecture and the moody, dynamic atmosphere created by the fast-moving sky. The time-lapse effect, which blurs the pedestrians into indistinct streaks of movement, further emphasizes the environment itself as the subject, highlighting the enduring presence of the landmark against the fleeting passage of time.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse shot captures the exterior of Buckingham Palace in London under a dramatic, overcast sky with fast-moving grey clouds. The grand, light-colored stone facade of the palace, with its many windows and a central flagpole, dominates the scene. In the middle ground, an ornate black wrought-iron fence with gold-colored details and large gates encloses the property. In the foreground, a few people can be seen walking quickly across the forecourt. A white logo overlay is visible in the bottom right corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The performer is positioned slightly to the left of center in the foreground, with a small open instrument case at their feet in the bottom left of the frame. Behind the performer, a row of market stalls lines the middle ground, stretching from the right edge to the center of the frame. Several shoppers are visible in the background, moving from left to right across the top portion of the frame. The camera is set at eye level with the performer and remains stationary throughout the shot. As the video progresses, the performer steps forward toward the camera, briefly obscuring the instrument case, while a cyclist passes behind them in the middle ground from right to left. A small digital clock is visible in the top right corner of the frame.",
