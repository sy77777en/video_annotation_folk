    "pre_caption": "A medium full shot frames a person standing in the center of a grassy field. The person is positioned in the middle ground, with the muted green grass extending from the foreground to the background. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down at them. Both the subject and the camera remain completely still throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person stands in a grassy field, wearing a tattered black suit jacket, a disheveled white shirt, a black tie, and black trousers. Their hands are covered in what appear to be grey gloves. The person's head is completely obscured by a light-colored, textured bag or mask, resembling bandages or burlap, that is wrapped around it. They remain stationary with a slightly slumped posture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A solitary figure stands motionless in a vast expanse of muted green grass under bright daylight. The figure is clad in a dark, tattered suit with a white shirt underneath, and their head is obscured by a light-colored, textured covering. A distinct shadow is cast upon the slightly faded lawn. The entire scene is presented in a desaturated color palette, giving the landscape a grayish-green hue.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

Large windows fill the background, occupying the top and left portions of the frame, with potted plants visible along the left edge in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at table height, level with the seated subjects. As the shot continues, the camera slowly pans left, bringing more of the café interior and additional tables into view, while the group remains in the bottom right foreground throughout the movement.",
