    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high, isometric angle, initially frames a blue hedgehog character and a purple creature in the center-left middle ground, next to a large cylindrical structure on the left. The character transforms into a blue sphere and rolls toward the bottom-left foreground, then moves to the center of the scene. Upon reaching the center, it reverts to its hedgehog form, now positioned in the middle ground with a small red enemy visible in the top-center background. The character then transforms back into a sphere and spins in place in the center of the frame. Throughout the video, game interface elements remain fixed in the top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A blue, anthropomorphic hedgehog with red and white shoes is the central character in a video game presented from an isometric perspective. The hedgehog is accompanied by a small, purple, dinosaur-like creature. The game's graphics feature pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites, giving the characters and environment a distinct, blocky, pseudo-3D appearance. The hedgehog character is also shown transforming into a solid blue sphere. Other elements in the scene include scattered gold rings and a small, red, crab-like enemy.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle showing the environment in a three-quarters perspective reveals an indoor, industrial-style level. The floor consists of a grid of gray and green tiles, with many of the gray tiles featuring a circular fan pattern. On the left, a large, metallic, cylindrical structure has a yellow sign with a black triangle on it. Orange, ribbed conduits line some of the platform edges, and golden rings are scattered across the floor. In the center of the area, a small, dark gray pyramidal structure and a blue, glowing button on a pedestal are also visible. Overlays are present on the screen: the top-left corner displays the word \"RINGS\" followed by a number, the bottom-left shows a character icon and a number, and the bottom-right features several character icons and other symbols.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
