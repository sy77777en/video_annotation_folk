    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a young man's face, which occupies the left half and extends towards the center of the frame, positioned in the foreground. He is shown in profile, facing towards the right side of the frame. An earring is visible on his right ear, which appears on the left side of the frame. In the background, primarily on the right side of the frame, several out-of-focus circular bokeh lights are present. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up profile view of a young man with short, light-colored hair and an earring in his right ear. He has a serious, focused expression, and there are some pimples scattered on his forehead and nose. He is facing to the right of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit environment. The background is significantly out of focus, appearing as a dark space punctuated by several soft, circular bokeh lights of varying brightness. The overall atmosphere is subdued, with the primary focus on the foreground subject, while the surrounding area remains indistinct and dark.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

She is facing directly toward the camera, with her hands resting on a stack of books that are placed in front of her, slightly to the right side of the frame. A small potted plant is visible in the background on the left side, positioned near the top left corner. The camera is angled slightly above the subject, looking down at her, and remains stationary for the duration of the shot. No significant movement occurs within the frame.",
