    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a person lying on a sofa, with their feet prominently positioned in the foreground, closer to the camera. The feet, adorned with shiny sprinkles, are centered in the frame, while the rest of the body is slightly blurred in the background, creating a shallow depth of field. The person's head is positioned farther away, towards the top center of the frame, enhancing the sense of depth. The sofa occupies the lower half of the frame, while the upper half consists of empty space and some visible green plants in the background, suggesting a cozy indoor setting. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a consistent focus on the feet throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person lying on a sofa, with their feet prominently positioned closer to the camera. The feet are adorned with shiny sprinkles, capturing the viewer's attention due to the shallow focus that blurs the rest of the body. The person appears relaxed, with their head resting farther away, creating a sense of depth. The composition divides the frame, with the lower half occupied by the person on the sofa and the upper half consisting of empty space, enhancing the focus on the feet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a relaxed atmosphere, likely a living room. A person is lying on a brown leather couch, with their feet prominently in the foreground. The feet are adorned with colorful, shiny confetti, adding a playful element to the scene. In the background, there are green plants, suggesting a cozy and natural environment. The lighting is soft and natural, indicating daytime, with light filtering through a window. The overall composition is calm and casual, focusing on the contrast between the textured leather couch and the sparkling confetti.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person lying on a sofa, with their feet positioned closer to the camera and their head farther away. The shallow focus emphasizes the feet, adorned with shiny sprinkles, while the rest of the body is slightly blurred. The composition divides the frame, with the lower half featuring the person on the sofa and the upper half showcasing empty space.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

Three people are seated around the table, positioned from left to right, each facing slightly toward the camera. The person on the left is in the foreground, closest to the camera, while the other two are in the middle ground and background, creating a sense of depth. A bowl of oranges sits at the bottom right of the frame, and a window with curtains is visible in the top left background. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, looking down at them, and remains stationary throughout the scene. No significant movement or changes in shot size occur during the video.",
