    "pre_caption": "This shot is framed from a high-angle, first-person perspective, looking down towards the ground. The lower body of the person filming occupies the bottom-center foreground, with their right hand holding a black camera in the bottom-right and their left hand visible in the bottom-left. As the person walks, their legs and a white-sneakered foot move in the center of the frame, while the concrete sidewalk that fills the scene appears to move from the top of the frame towards the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person point of view, a person with a light skin tone is seen walking. He is wearing a dark gray t-shirt and mauve-colored shorts, and a white sneaker. In his right hand, he holds a black camera with a lens, secured by a black wrist strap, while his left hand is visible at his side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a view looking down as a person walks along a sidewalk during the day. The ground is paved with large, light gray concrete slabs. The individual is wearing purple shorts, a dark t-shirt, and white sneakers. In their right hand, they hold a black camera secured with a wrist strap, while their left hand swings by their side. The camera maintains a steady downward angle, showing the person's legs and feet moving forward with each step.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

A small brown dog is centered in the foreground, facing the camera, while a red ball sits to the left in the middle ground. In the background, a wooden fence stretches across the top of the frame. The dog moves from the center toward the right side of the frame, briefly obscuring the ball. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining its low position relative to the dog.
