    "pre_caption": "In this full shot, a dog is suspended in the middle ground at the center of the frame, with a person's hands and arms positioned in the middle ground to the left. The camera, initially positioned above the dog, executes a vertical circular motion, rotating downwards and then upwards around a central vertical axis. This movement causes the perspective on the stationary dog to shift from an overhead view to an underbelly view, changing the camera's height from above the subject to below it. As the camera rotates, an indistinct object in the background on the right becomes more visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this low-quality, greenish-tinted video is a dark-colored dog with a long body, short hair, and tan markings on its underside. The dog, which wears a collar, remains completely still in the air while the camera performs a vertical circular motion around a central vertical pole. A person, of whom only light-skinned hands and forearms are visible, appears poised to hug the dog but does not touch or manipulate it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is captured with a grainy, yellowish-green tint characteristic of older video formats. The setting features a yellowish floor and light-colored walls. A thin, vertical pole effect is centrally positioned in the frame, around which a dark-colored dog appears to be suspended in the air. A person, whose hands and arms are partially visible, remains static and poised to hold the dog. In the background, indistinct furniture includes an object resembling a blackboard. The entire video is presented within a black frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to below the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "This medium close-up shot features a cat sitting in the right foreground, occupying the lower right quadrant of the frame. A small potted plant is visible in the background near the center, partially obscured by the cat’s body. The camera is positioned at the same height as the cat’s head, maintaining a level perspective throughout the video. During the shot, the cat turns its head from right to left, while the plant remains stationary. No significant changes in shot size or camera angle occur, and all elements retain their initial spatial positions within the frame.",
