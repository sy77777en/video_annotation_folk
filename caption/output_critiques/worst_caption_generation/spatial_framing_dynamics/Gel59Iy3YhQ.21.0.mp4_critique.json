    "pre_caption": "This wide shot presents an animated character with atypical anatomy in the foreground, positioned on the left side of the frame. The character is seated on a large cliff that occupies the bottom left. In the middle ground, a vast expanse of clouds stretches across the lower half of the scene, from the center to the right. The background is composed of a starry sky filling the top portion of the frame and a glowing orb situated in the bottom right, far in the distance among the clouds. The camera is positioned at a height similar to the character, capturing the view from behind them in a static frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an animated character with long pink hair sitting on the ground. The character is dressed in dark-colored clothing and is facing away, gazing towards a colorful, cloud-filled sky. The character's posture is relaxed, with arms wrapped around its knees. The scene conveys a sense of contemplation or observation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated outdoor scene set at twilight, a figure with long magenta hair sits on the edge of a large, purple cliff, gazing out over a vast landscape. The deep purple sky above is filled with white and pink stars, and faint beams of light shine down. Below, a sea of pink and purple clouds stretches towards the horizon, where a bright, glowing orb is visible. Small patches of green land can be seen peeking through the cloud cover.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

The birds are arranged in a line from left to right, with the tallest bird on the right and the smallest on the left. Behind them, in the middle ground, a wooden fence runs horizontally across the frame, separating the birds from a field of sunflowers that fills the background from the bottom to the top edge. The sunflowers are densely packed, with some leaning slightly toward the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned slightly above the birds, looking down at them from a gentle overhead angle. No significant movement occurs within the scene.",
