    "pre_caption": "A middle-aged man is shown in a medium close-up shot, positioned centrally in the foreground. Behind him, a portion of a brown leather couch is visible in the middle ground, extending across the lower part of the frame. The background features a room with wooden paneling; a white sink and a bonsai tree are situated in the top left of the background, while a window showing a sunlit outdoor scene, along with books and decorative items, occupies the right side of the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the man remains relatively static within this framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged man with light skin and a balding head with short, dark hair on the sides is shown from the chest up. He is wearing a light blue, button-down, collared shirt and initially focuses on the person speaking before returning his gaze to the camera with a serious expression. He is seated.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a room with rustic wooden paneling on the walls. A brown leather couch is visible in the middle ground. In the background, a white sink with silver faucets is mounted on the wooden wall, with a small bonsai tree in a dark pot to its left. To the right, a window offers a view of a bright, sunlit outdoor area with green foliage. On a surface near the window, there are stacked books, a small, light-brown wooden birdhouse-like object, and a small, golden, decorative item. The overall lighting suggests it is daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "A young woman is shown in a wide shot, seated on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. To her left, a large aquarium filled with colorful fish occupies the center and left portions of the background, stretching from the bottom to the top of the frame. A tall potted plant stands in the bottom right foreground, partially obscuring the lower edge of the woman’s chair. The background also includes a brick wall with several framed photographs arranged along the top edge. The camera is positioned slightly above the subject’s eye level, and the woman occasionally shifts her posture while glancing toward the aquarium.",
