    "pre_caption": "Initially, a light brown, textured wall occupies the foreground center, with a dark firearm visible at the bottom center foreground. Overlay elements, including a blue minimap in the bottom left, a kill feed in the center-bottom, and an ammunition counter in the bottom right, are fixed in the foreground. Orange objective markers are visible in the upper frame, indicating points in the middle ground or background. The view then pans upwards, revealing grey metal stairs with black railings that extend from the center foreground into the middle ground. An enemy soldier briefly appears in the middle ground, running from right to left near the stairs before ascending them. The perspective continues to move upwards, simulating an ascent of these stairs, which remain central. This movement transitions to an elevated outdoor position where a large, black railing structure is prominent across the foreground center. Beyond this railing, an industrial or military-style area is visible in the middle ground and background, featuring a large, dark grey structure in the center-left middle ground, around which smoke or dust is present, with distant buildings and palm trees in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a first-person perspective from a video game. A dark firearm, held by unseen hands, is visible at the bottom of the screen. A heads-up display overlays the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower left, a kill feed in the center-bottom showing text like \"cloudedtruth [QBB-95] ViciousBambi\" and \"ENEMY KILLED 100\", and an ammunition counter in the lower right displaying \"71/101\". An enemy character, a soldier figure in dark, possibly camouflaged, combat gear and a helmet, is briefly seen running near a set of stairs. In the wider view, a large, dark, metallic, scaffolding structure is prominent against a hazy, light-colored sky, with light-brown or beige, possibly concrete, building walls and some green foliage also visible. Orange diamond-shaped objective markers with numbers like \"74\" and \"20\" appear on screen, indicating points of interest or enemy locations.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, initially shows a rough, light brown, textured wall before the view moves up a set of stairs with black railings. This ascent leads to an outdoor, elevated position overlooking an industrial or military-style area during the daytime. The environment includes distant buildings, some palm trees, and a prominent, large, dark grey structure that is part of the railing, around which smoke or dust is visible. The ground appears to be dirt or concrete. Several overlay elements are present: a minimap with blue and white icons is in the bottom left corner; a kill feed with blue and red text is in the lower central area; ammo and health indicators with white numbers are in the bottom right; and orange diamond-shaped objective markers are visible in the upper portion of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot showing a green chalkboard filling the center foreground, with a white piece of chalk resting at the bottom right foreground. Overlay graphics include a red timer in the top left, a score counter in the top right, and a weather icon in the bottom left, all fixed in the foreground. Yellow sticky notes are attached along the upper edge of the chalkboard. The camera then tilts downward, revealing a wooden desk that extends from the center foreground into the middle ground. A student briefly enters the frame from the left, walking toward the desk and stopping near its center. The camera continues to tilt downward, simulating a descent toward the desk, which remains central in the frame. This movement transitions to a close-up of an open textbook lying across the foreground center. Beyond the textbook, a classroom with rows of empty chairs is visible in the middle ground and background, with large windows and trees outside in the background. The camera remains at the height of the desk throughout the sequence.",
