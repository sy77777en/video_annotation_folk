    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot of a 2D gaming scene, captured from a side-view perspective. In the foreground, a blue-armored figure stands stationary at the bottom left. Initially, a green-hatted figure is positioned on the left, slightly above the blue figure. This green figure then moves to the right, passing in front of the blue figure, before returning to the left side of the frame. Both characters remain in the bottom left quadrant. The background consists of a dark brick wall framed by two vertical pillars in the middle ground, with a purple structure hanging from the top center. A heads-up display is overlaid at the very top of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two pixelated figures. Initially, the figure with light skin, wearing a green pointed hat, a green upper garment, and brown lower garments or boots, is positioned above the blue-armored character and moves from left to right. On the left, another figure is depicted in blue and silver metallic armor, primarily facing left and holding a weapon. This second figure maintains a similar pose and position throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video, where the camera is placed to the side capturing the scene in profile, is set within an indoor, 2D level. The environment features a floor and ceiling made of brown brick. The background is a dark, black wall with a faint brick texture, framed by two vertical, brown-striped pillars. A purple, scalloped structure hangs from the ceiling between the pillars. Two small, pixelated characters occupy the space, with the green character standing on top of the blue character. A heads-up display is overlaid at the top, showing \"MAGIC-5\" and \"LIFE-6\" with corresponding status bars, alongside \"NEXT 0542/2000\".**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
