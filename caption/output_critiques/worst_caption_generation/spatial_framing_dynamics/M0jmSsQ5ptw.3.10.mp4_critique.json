    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman is positioned in the bottom center foreground in a sprinter's starting stance on a long blue mat. The mat extends from her position diagonally toward the left background. A long, white, fabric-covered structure occupies the middle ground, running parallel to the mat from the right side of the frame into the distance. Ropes and pulleys are visible connecting the structure to equipment near the woman. In the right background, a wooden fence and distant mountains can be seen. During the shot, the text \"LOLO JONES\" appears as an overlay on the blue mat in the bottom left foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with a tan complexion is in a sprinter's starting position on a long blue mat laid out on an asphalt surface. She is wearing a pink sports bra and black capri-length leggings. Her hands are on the mat, and her feet are on small, specialized platforms. A system of ropes and pulleys is connected solely to a very long, white, fabric-covered structure next to the mat. The name \"LOLO JONES\" is written in large, white outlined letters on the blue mat in front of her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a gray, paved lot under a sky with scattered white clouds. A very long, rectangular structure covered in white fabric dominates the view, running parallel to a long, dark blue mat laid out on the asphalt. The white structure is secured by a network of ropes, pulleys, and stakes. Behind the white structure, a wooden fence is visible, with distant mountains on the horizon. At the far end of the setup, a wooden crane-like structure stands. An overlay of the text \"LOLO JONES\" appears in white, outlined letters on the blue mat.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The umbrella stretches diagonally across the frame toward the bottom left foreground, partially covering a small table with a chessboard on it. To the left, a row of potted plants lines the edge of a wooden deck in the foreground, while a bicycle leans against a brick wall in the background. A white cat sits near the center bottom of the frame, facing away from the camera. During the shot, the text \"GRAND OPENING\" appears as an overlay above the chessboard in the bottom center foreground. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, looking down at an angle.",
