    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot looking up from the floor, with the underside of a round table occupying the foreground at the top and left of the frame. In the middle ground, a person is seen upside down on the left from the upper body, with a red, ribbon-like object extending from them down toward the center. A second person is partially visible in the middle ground on the right. A pole runs vertically through the center of the scene, and two framed pictures are visible in the background on the right wall. The table in the foreground then moves toward the bottom left, revealing the second person almost fully in the center-right middle ground. As this happens, the first person becomes mostly obscured, with only their hands remaining in view at the top left. A burst of fire then appears in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, in front of the second person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video starts with an upside-down low-angle perspective, transitioning to a standard low-angle view. Two people are visible: a person with light skin wearing a white t-shirt, seen from the upper body, with a long, glowing red object appearing as a visual effect suspended in mid-air. As the view changes, a man with dark skin, wearing a white t-shirt and light-colored pants, becomes the primary focus. He stands with his hands raised as an orange burst of flame, also a visual effect, appears in front of him. At this point, only the hands of the first person remain visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with an upside-down low-angle perspective, transitioning to a standard low-angle view. The scene is set in an indoor room with light-colored, textured walls, a light green ceiling, and a black and white dotted floor. A metal pole extends from the floor to the ceiling at the center of the view. Two framed pictures are visible on the wall. A bright red, ribbon-like visual effect appears suspended in midair, followed by a burst of fire erupting in the middle of the room. The underside of a round, dark brown table is also visible. The entire video has a grainy, low-fidelity appearance and is bordered by a dark vignette overlay.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an upside-down low angle, looking up at the underside of a table and the people around it. The person on the left is shown from the upper body, while the person on the right is only partially visible from the midsection. As the camera moves, the person who was on the right is now almost fully visible, while only the hands of the person on the left remain in view.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a single person seated at a rectangular desk, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. The camera is at eye level with the subject. To the left in the middle ground, a large potted plant is visible, while a window with closed blinds appears in the background on the right. The person stands up and moves toward the right side of the frame, shifting from the foreground to the middle ground, while the plant remains stationary. As the person moves, the camera pans slightly to the right, keeping them centered. A small dog enters from the bottom left foreground and sits near the desk. The camera remains at the same height throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective on the subjects.",
