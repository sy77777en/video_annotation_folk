    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle top-down shot, a human-like character is initially positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a snowball directly below it. A snow-covered tree is visible in the top right corner in the background, while dark cliffs frame the bottom corners. The frame then scrolls to the right and then downwards, repositioning the human character and snowball to the left of center. This movement reveals a skeleton character who appears in the top right of the frame, standing in the background on a cliff edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated human-like character with brown, shoulder-length hair and yellowish skin is depicted wearing a purple and blue striped shirt. Near this character rests a round, white snowball. A second character, a short, pixelated skeleton, is also visible. This skeleton has a wide, grinning skull and is dressed in a blue, unzipped hoodie over a white shirt and black shorts, and is barefoot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the scene is set in an outdoor, snowy landscape rendered in a pixel art style. The ground is a light blue expanse of snow, forming stepped platforms and bordered by dark, rocky cliffs. In the upper corner, a single pine tree is covered in snow. The view scrolls to the right and then downward, revealing more of the snowy terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

A tall lamppost stands in the center background, while a bench is visible in the bottom right corner. The camera slowly pans upward and to the left, shifting the car toward the bottom center and moving the bicycle out of view. This movement brings a person holding an umbrella into the top left of the frame, standing near the lamppost. The camera remains at eye level with the car throughout the shot.",
