    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to frame three puppet-like human figures within a living room. The man stands on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, holding a duffel bag, while the child is positioned in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, facing away from the camera. The woman is partially visible on the left side of the frame, higher up on a staircase in the background. The sofa, coffee table, and rug are arranged along the back wall in the background, with the window and side table further right. The camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down at an angle, which places the viewer at a higher vantage point relative to all figures. In the transition between shots, the man and his bag exit the frame to the right, leaving the child in the center and the woman still on the stairs, maintaining their spatial positions but shifting the focus to the child and the room’s furnishings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three puppet-like human figures with neutral facial features and stylized appearances. The man on the right has pale skin, a bald head with a fringe of dark hair, a mustache, and is dressed in a brown suit over a white shirt with stripes and dark trousers; he holds a large green and brown duffel bag. The child in the center has light skin and long brown hair, and wears a yellow plaid shirt with rolled-up sleeves, blue jeans, and black shoes, standing with their back to the viewer. The woman on the left, partially visible on a staircase, has light skin, short brown hair, and wears a yellow dress. The man and child are positioned near each other, suggesting interaction, while the woman observes from the stairs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a cozy, warmly lit living room with wooden flooring and wallpapered walls featuring a subtle pattern. A colorful sofa with floral cushions is positioned against the wall, accompanied by a small wooden coffee table on a green rug. A framed landscape painting hangs above the sofa, adding to the room's homely atmosphere. A staircase with wooden railings descends into the room, suggesting a multi-level home. A window allows natural light to filter in, illuminating the space. The setting is detailed with a few pieces of furniture, including a side table with drawers. The overall ambiance is inviting and domestic, with a focus on the room's decor and layout.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up shot that frames two adult figures seated at a dining table. The woman is positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground, facing slightly toward the center, while the man sits on the right side, also in the foreground, with his hands resting on the table. A large bowl of fruit is placed in the center of the table, occupying the middle ground. Behind them, a tall bookshelf filled with books and decorative items spans the background, stretching from the left to the right edge of the frame. The window is located on the left side of the background, partially obscured by a curtain. The camera is set at eye level with the seated adults, maintaining a straight-on perspective throughout the scene. No significant movement occurs, and the spatial arrangement of the subjects and elements remains consistent from start to finish.",
