    "pre_caption": "Initially, voluminous plumes of pink liquid occupy the top left and extend towards the center, while blue/cyan liquid plumes are positioned in the top right, also extending towards the center, all primarily in the middle ground against a black background. These colored masses slowly descend and expand, with tendrils of pink moving from the left towards the center and bottom, and tendrils of blue/cyan moving from the right towards the center and bottom. The two colors intermingle in the central middle ground, creating mixed hues. Throughout the video, numerous small droplets of pink, blue/cyan, and mixed colors detach from these main plumes and fall downwards across the entire frame, from top to bottom, appearing in the foreground as they create streaks. The overall dynamic is a continuous downward flow and swirling interaction of these liquids, gradually filling more of the central and lower portions of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an abstract visual of brightly colored liquids, predominantly vibrant pink and luminous blue/cyan, interacting within a dark, likely black, medium. These liquids form voluminous, cloud-like plumes that billow and swirl, with delicate tendrils and wispy formations extending downwards. As the pink and blue/cyan liquids intermingle, areas of purple and mixed hues become visible. Numerous small, distinct droplets of the same pink and blue/cyan colors are seen detaching from the main masses and slowly descending, creating streaks and trails. The overall effect is a dynamic and evolving mixture of these contrasting colors.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A cloud of vibrant pink and cyan ink billows and swirls upwards against a stark black background. The two colors intermingle, creating shades of purple where they meet. Droplets of both pink and cyan, as well as mixed purple, detach from the main cloud and rise, leaving thin trails. The ink has a viscous, almost gelatinous appearance as it slowly ascends and expands, with tendrils and plumes forming and dissipating.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a single large orange sphere positioned in the bottom right of the frame, occupying the foreground. Several smaller green cubes are scattered across the top left and top center, placed in the background. The orange sphere remains stationary throughout, while the green cubes slowly drift downward and to the right, moving from the background into the middle ground. As the video progresses, a yellow triangular prism enters from the left edge, traveling horizontally across the center of the frame in the middle ground before stopping near the orange sphere. The camera is positioned slightly above the main subjects, looking down at a shallow angle. No significant changes in shot size occur, but the spatial arrangement shifts as the green cubes and yellow prism move closer to the orange sphere, creating a clustered composition in the lower right by the end of the scene.",
