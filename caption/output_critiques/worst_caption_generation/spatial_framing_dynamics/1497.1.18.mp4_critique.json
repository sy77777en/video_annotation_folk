    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, framing two individuals in the center-right and middle ground as they lie on a table. To the left, two tall-backed chairs occupy the foreground and middle ground, set against dark green curtains in the background. A large volume of water suddenly erupts from the right side of the frame, moving left and completely engulfing the individuals. This action causes the subjects to disappear from view, obscured by the water which now fills the center and right of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two individuals, one wearing red and the other in black, are lying on their stomachs on a table covered with a light-colored cloth. A massive wave of rushing water erupts from the right side of the scene, forcefully hitting and completely engulfing both individuals' heads and upper bodies. To the left, two tall-backed chairs with purple and gold patterned upholstery are visible. The individuals are almost entirely obscured by the water by the end of the clip.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a formally decorated room with dark green curtains in the background, two individuals, one wearing red and the other in black, are positioned on their stomachs on a table. Suddenly, they are engulfed by a powerful wave of rushing water. The room features high-backed chairs upholstered in a purple and gold patterned fabric, with two chairs visible on the left side of the frame. A table is covered with a light-colored cloth, and part of a chandelier is visible above. A watermark for \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" is present in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To the right, a small round table with a vase of flowers is positioned in the middle ground. The person slowly walks toward the center of the frame, while the camera remains slightly above their head, looking down at an angle. As the person reaches the center, a dog enters from the top right background and moves diagonally toward the bottom center, passing behind the person. The shot remains steady throughout, with no changes in camera height or angle.",
