    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a person in ski gear, who is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame. A pole held by the person extends from the bottom center to the bottom right, also in the foreground. The shot then transitions to a medium full shot as the person moves down a snow-covered slope that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. To the right, in the middle ground, a red and black rectangular object is visible next to a line of bare trees that recedes into the background. The camera maintains a position at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is shown from a selfie point of view, featuring a person dressed in winter ski attire. They are wearing a black jacket with contrasting off-white sleeves. Their pants are black and puffy. On their left hand, they wear a black glove and are holding a metal pole, possibly a ski pole or a selfie stick, which also has red accents on the handle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, the scene is set on a wide, snow-covered slope during an overcast day. The path is bordered by a dense forest of bare, thin-trunked trees under a flat white sky. To the side of the slope, a red and black rectangular object is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
