    "pre_caption": "This full shot captures a grey squirrel in the center-left foreground, positioned on top of a wooden post. A wooden fence extends across the middle ground, with out-of-focus trees filling the background. The camera is positioned at the squirrel's level. Initially, the squirrel sits upright on the post. It then leans forward and begins to climb headfirst down the side of the post, its body moving lower in the frame while its tail remains curled over the top. The camera and framing remain static throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A mixed gray-brown squirrel with a white underside and a large, bushy tail is shown on top of a rough, bark-covered wooden post. Initially, the squirrel sits upright with its front paws held together near its chest. It then leans forward, turns back, and begins to climb headfirst down the side of the post, gripping the bark with its claws as its tail rests on the top, surrounding the opposite side of the trunk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime outdoor setting, a grey squirrel is positioned atop a rough, bark-covered tree stump. The background, which is out of focus, features a weathered wooden fence with vertical slats and a dense thicket of bare tree branches. The squirrel, initially sitting upright with its paws held together, proceeds to move headfirst down the side of the stump, clinging to the bark and gnawing on the wood.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "This medium shot frames a small brown rabbit in the bottom-right middle ground, sitting on a patch of grass. A stone pathway runs horizontally across the background, with a row of colorful flowers lining the top edge of the frame. The camera is positioned slightly above the rabbit, looking down at an angle. At first, the rabbit is crouched low, facing left. It then hops forward toward the center of the frame, briefly pausing before sniffing the ground. The camera remains stationary, and the spatial arrangement of the elements does not change during the video.",
