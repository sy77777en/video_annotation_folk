    "pre_caption": "This static extreme wide shot captures a vast landscape. The Grand Canyon fills the bottom half of the frame, with its rock formations extending from the foreground on the right, across the middle ground, and into the background toward the center and left. The top half of the frame is occupied by the sky, where large, billowing clouds are positioned in the middle ground. A patch of blue sky is visible in the top left. In the middle ground and background, curtains of rain fall from the clouds in the center and left portions of the scene. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking out over the canyon from an elevated viewpoint.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot overlooking the immense expanse of the Grand Canyon under a turbulent sky. Heavy, billowing white and dark grey clouds dominate the view, set against patches of deep blue. In the distance, curtains of rain fall from the storm clouds, partially obscuring the far-off canyon walls. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the sheer scale of the natural wonder and the powerful, atmospheric weather conditions. The focus is on capturing the grandeur of the environment rather than a specific object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a wide, panoramic view of the Grand Canyon from a low-angle perspective. The vast canyon features deep gorges and layered rock formations in shades of red, brown, and tan. The sky above is dramatic, filled with large, billowing white and dark grey storm clouds. Streaks of rain can be seen falling in the distance over parts of the canyon, while a patch of deep blue sky is visible through a break in the cloud cover.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The tree’s branches spread outward, reaching toward the left and right edges, while a small wooden bench is visible at the bottom right in the foreground. In the background, a row of distant houses lines the horizon, stretching from the left to the center of the frame. The sky, mostly clear with a few small clouds, fills the upper third of the image. The camera is positioned at eye level with the base of the tree, remaining stationary throughout the shot.",
