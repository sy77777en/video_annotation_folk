As the camera moves to the left, the crane gradually shifts out of the frame, revealing more of the city's skyline and additional construction sites. The sky transitions from a mix of blue and orange hues to deeper shades of orange and pink as the sun sets. The camera continues to pan left, showing more buildings and construction cranes, with the city lights starting to turn on. The video concludes with a broader view of the city, highlighting the illuminated buildings and the expansive sunset sky.",
