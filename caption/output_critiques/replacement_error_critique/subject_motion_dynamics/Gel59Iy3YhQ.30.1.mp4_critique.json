    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, a blue projectile with a white trail flies from the lower left across a dark blue surface. In the center of a spotlight, two goat-like figures are struck in succession, each exploding in a white, circular burst. A small, dark-cloaked figure holding a glowing red sword moves from the lower right toward the center, where two other goat-like figures converge. These goat-like figures throw their crescent-shaped weapons, which travel like boomerangs. The cloaked figure attacks one of the goat-like figures, creating a large, glowing red crescent shape on the ground as another blue projectile flies across the screen from the top right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a dimly lit, high-angle scene, several stylized humanoid figures are depicted on a dark blue surface covered with red rocks. The most prominent figures are brown, goat-like creatures clad in tan attire, distinguished by large, white, crescent-shaped horns or headpieces. Among them is a small, dark figure in a dark cloak holding a glowing red sword. Initially, a floating, purple, squid-like creature with tentacles is visible, but it disappears shortly thereafter. The scene features two bright blue, glowing projectiles leaving a white smoke trail, likely created by another dark figure hidden on the right side. White, air-like fragments are scattered around the weapons of the prominent figures. Large, glowing red crescent shapes materialize when the small dark figure with the glowing red sword attacks. Initially, a floating, blue, triangular creature holding a stick is visible.**",
