    "pre_caption": "A humanoid figure is seated at a wooden desk, typing on a black keyboard while looking at a computer monitor displaying lines of white code. The camera moves backward, then tilts downward, focusing on a brown cardboard box on the floor. The camera continues to move downward, zooming in on the shipping label on the box, which reads 'PRIORITY MAIL 2-DAY' and lists the sender and recipient addresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video initially shows a humanoid figure with brown hair and light skin, wearing a dark grey shirt, sitting at a wooden desk and typing on a black keyboard. The figure faces a black computer monitor displaying lines of white code on a dark background. To the right of the monitor is a black computer tower with a glowing blue light, and a black speaker is visible to the right of the tower. The scene is dimly lit with a reddish hue. The focus then shifts downward to a brown, rectangular cardboard box on the floor. A white rectangular shipping label is affixed to the box, featuring black text, a barcode, and a \"P\" logo for Priority Mail. The label indicates \"PRIORITY MAIL 2-DAY\" and shows the sender as \"David Pokora, 2597 Hensall St, MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO\" and the recipient as \"Justin May, 123 MAPLE DRIVE, WILMINGTON DE 19801.\"**",
