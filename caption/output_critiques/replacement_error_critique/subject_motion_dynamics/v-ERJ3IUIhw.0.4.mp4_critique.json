    "pre_caption": "The animation begins with the woman holding a butterfly-shaped hairpin to her cheek. Her hair is long and flowing, and she wears a high-collared, long-sleeved dress. As the animation progresses, her hair is pulled back, and she dons large hoop earrings. Her facial features and makeup transition from an East Asian style to an Indian one. Her attire changes to a short-sleeved top with a long piece of fabric draped over one shoulder and wrapped around her waist, resembling a sari. She adjusts and fans out the fabric, completing the transformation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A hand-drawn animation in blue pencil depicts the upper body of a woman undergoing a transformation in appearance and attire. Initially, she is shown with her hair tied back, bangs parted to both sides of her forehead, and adorned with a small butterfly-shaped hairpin. She is dressed in a traditional Chinese outfit with a high collar and short sleeves, resembling a qipao. The scene then shifts as her hair becomes medium-length and flows freely over her shoulders before being tied back again. Her facial features and makeup transition from an East Asian style to an Indian style, and she wears large hoop earrings. Her inner garment changes to a short-sleeved, midriff-baring top, with a long piece of fabric draped over one shoulder and wrapped around her waist, resembling a sari. She adjusts the sari, lifting the back part forward and upward with her left hand to fan it out.**",
