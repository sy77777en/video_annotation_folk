    "pre_caption": "This video presents a breathtaking landscape scenery shot of a polar or subarctic region at night. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overwhelming scale and atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the natural world. A vast, snow-covered terrain, glowing with an ethereal green hue, stretches towards a distant treeline under a dark, star-studded sky. Dominating the entire scene is a spectacular and dynamic display of the aurora borealis, with brilliant green lights swirling, waving, and pulsing across the heavens. A few small, illuminated buildings and a snowy road are visible in the mid-ground, dwarfed by the immense natural spectacle above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
