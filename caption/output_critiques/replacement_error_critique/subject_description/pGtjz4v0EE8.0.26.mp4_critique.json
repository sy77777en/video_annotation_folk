    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the overall atmosphere and environment rather than a specific main subject. The scene is a time-lapse of the ancient Colosseum in Rome, which stands majestically illuminated by warm, golden lights against a dark twilight sky. A wide-angle, fisheye lens creates a sweeping, distorted perspective that enhances the grandeur of the architecture. In the foreground, the constant motion of city life is represented by long, flowing streaks of white, yellow, and red light from passing vehicles, creating a stark and beautiful contrast between the fast-paced present and the enduring historical monument.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
