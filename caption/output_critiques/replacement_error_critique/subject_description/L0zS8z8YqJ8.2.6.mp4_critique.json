    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot, moving through a series of simply furnished rooms. The camera glides from a storage area, featuring white-framed shelves with wooden surfaces against wood-paneled walls, into an adjoining bedroom. This second room contains a simple wooden bed with white linens and a matching wooden desk and chair. A small window offers a view of green trees against a grassy landscape. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment, showcasing the minimalist and utilitarian design of the wood-paneled interior.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
