    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a magnificent medieval castle. The structure, built from dark stone, features numerous towers and turrets with red-and-white timber framing and steep, dark-grey slate roofs, all set against a cloudy, overcast sky. The castle is perched on a hill and enveloped by a dense, lush green forest, with a stone bridge leading to an arched gateway where a few people are walking. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the grand scale and picturesque atmosphere of the castle within its natural environment. The people present are incidental, serving to emphasize the size of the structure rather than acting as focal points themselves.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
