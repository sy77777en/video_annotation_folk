    "pre_caption": "This video presents a vibrant cityscape scenery shot of a small town's main street at night, bathed in the glow of numerous colorful neon signs. The focus is on establishing the lively, retro atmosphere of the environment rather than highlighting a specific subject. The street is lined with low-rise buildings adorned with signs like a large vertical pink \"MRS MUFF\" sign, a red arrow for \"MUDDY'S MUDFLAPS,\" and a green arrow pointing down that reads \"EAT.\" A red fire truck drives down the center of the road, followed by a small, light-colored car, while two classic cars, one red and one teal, are parked on the right, all contributing to the bustling yet nostalgic ambiance of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
