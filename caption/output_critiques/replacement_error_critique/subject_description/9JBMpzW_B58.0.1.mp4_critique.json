    "pre_caption": "This is a seascape scenery shot captured from the bow of a large container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The sky above is a breathtaking celestial display, filled with a dense field of brilliant stars and the luminous band of the Milky Way, partially veiled by dark, drifting clouds. A faint, ethereal green and yellow glow, possibly airglow, lines the horizon where the dark sea meets the star-filled expanse. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale and serene atmosphere of the natural environment. The ship serves merely as a vantage point, its presence grounding the viewer and highlighting the vastness of the sea and sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
