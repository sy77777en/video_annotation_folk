    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures an urban environment with a focus on the architectural elements and the overall atmosphere of the city. The camera work highlights the scale and layout of the city, showcasing a prominent building with a dome and a tall spire, as well as surrounding structures. The emphasis is on the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings, with the distant hills and a body of water adding depth to the scene. The lack of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the broader cityscape and its ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",
