    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dynamic outdoor scenery shot. The central visual event is a green object, likely a water balloon, exploding on a rough, brown tree stump, sending a dramatic spray of clear water outwards and upwards. The water droplets catch the light, creating a sparkling, energetic effect. The background is softly blurred, revealing a pile of cut logs and indistinct green foliage, suggesting a natural, possibly wooded or garden, environment. There is no single main subject in the traditional sense; instead, the focus is on the transient, forceful action of the water bursting and interacting with the natural elements, creating an atmosphere of sudden, chaotic energy within a rustic outdoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
