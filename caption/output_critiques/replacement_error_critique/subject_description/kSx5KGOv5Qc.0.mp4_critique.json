    "pre_caption": "This video presents a high-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing a breathtaking panoramic view of a historic walled city on a peninsula. The city is a dense cluster of buildings with iconic terracotta-orange roofs, all enclosed by formidable ancient stone walls that meet the deep blue sea. A small harbor, filled with numerous white boats, is nestled into the city's edge where the water is a vibrant turquoise. The perspective is from a rocky, green hillside in the foreground, with a cable car tower visible on the right, descending towards the urban area. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to emphasize the grand scale, stunning location, and overall atmosphere of the entire city and its relationship with the surrounding natural landscape, rather than focusing on a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
