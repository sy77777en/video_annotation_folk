    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cultural scenery shot of a traditional Japanese building. The scene begins focused on a large wooden sign displaying a photograph of a tranquil garden with a pond and mountains. The camera then pans left, revealing more of the building's exterior, which features white plaster walls, dark wooden framing, and a tiled roof. This movement brings into view a small, meticulously arranged gravel garden with moss-covered rocks, a low wooden fence, and a large wooden gate. A white banner with black circular crests hangs above the gate, adding to the traditional aesthetic. The shot lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the serene atmosphere and architectural details of the temple-like environment, from the sign and garden to the latticed windows and entryway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
