    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling an endless, sterile pool hallway. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere and bizarre environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of unease and mystery. The scene is a long, narrow corridor with walls, a ceiling, and a narrow walkway all covered in small, white, square tiles. Alongside the walkway runs a channel of dark, murky water, separated by a simple metal railing. The space is illuminated by bright, hazy light from recessed rectangular fixtures on the walls, casting a greenish, desaturated glow over everything. At the far end of the corridor, a single, large, yellow rubber duck sits in a brightly lit alcove, serving as a strange and incongruous focal point in the otherwise empty and monotonous environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
