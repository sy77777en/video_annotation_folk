    "pre_caption": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot, offering a perspective down a wide Venetian canal. On either side, historic, multi-story buildings with varied facades, arched windows, and terracotta roofs press closely together, bordering the greenish-blue, slightly choppy water. The scene is animated by several watercraft: a yellow and white water taxi prominently marked \"ALILAGUNA\" traverses the foreground, a classic black gondola with its gondolier glides further down the canal, and other smaller boats, including a blue one moored on the left, are visible. The sky is a uniform overcast grey. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the encompassing environment, capturing the characteristic atmosphere, architectural density, and lively maritime activity of the iconic Venetian waterway, emphasizing its scale and unique urban fabric.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
