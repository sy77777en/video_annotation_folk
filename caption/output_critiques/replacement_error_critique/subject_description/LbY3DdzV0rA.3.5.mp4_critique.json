    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast canyon at night. Under a partially starry sky, massive, dark storm clouds gather, periodically erupting in brilliant flashes of lightning that illuminate the deep, layered rock formations of the canyon below. A distinct column of rain is visible within the storm, and a single, sharp bolt of lightning strikes down, while a mysterious, steady orange glow persists on the distant horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to convey the immense scale and awe-inspiring power of the natural environment and the atmospheric drama of the storm itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
