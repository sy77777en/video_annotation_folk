    "pre_caption": "This video presents an aerial scenery shot, initially focusing on a roof under construction, characterized by light brown oriented strand board (OSB) panels, some marked with blue chalk lines, and construction equipment like a ladder, a yellow power tool, and a safety harness. The camera then transitions to reveal an older, weathered wooden roof composed of dark brown planks, showing signs of age with gaps between the boards and remnants of black roofing material. There is no main subject as the camera's top-down perspective and movement emphasize the textures, materials, and overall state of the different roof surfaces, highlighting the contrast between new construction and aged structures rather than a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
