    "pre_caption": "This video features a surreal architectural scenery shot, capturing a forward-moving perspective through a long, narrow corridor. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all uniformly covered in small, pale green square tiles, creating a sterile and disorienting grid that extends into the distance. The sequence begins at the base of a short flight of tiled stairs partially submerged in dark, murky water, which quickly recedes to reveal the full length of the brightly lit, hazy tunnel. Further down the corridor, a series of glowing, oval-shaped lights line the walls, leading the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway at the very end. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on conveying the strange, dreamlike atmosphere of the environment itself. The camera's movement serves to emphasize the scale, repetitive patterns, and unsettling nature of this liminal space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
