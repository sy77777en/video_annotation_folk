    "pre_caption": "This is an underwater scenery shot depicting the tiled floor of a swimming pool. The small, square tiles are a muted, dark green, and the water above them is slightly murky, creating a dim and somber atmosphere. In the center of the frame, a patch of tiles appears darker and irregularly shaped, suggesting a stain or repair. The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is entirely on the quiet, submerged environment. The shot's purpose is to convey a specific mood through the visual texture of the tiles and the quality of the underwater light, rather than to follow a particular character or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
