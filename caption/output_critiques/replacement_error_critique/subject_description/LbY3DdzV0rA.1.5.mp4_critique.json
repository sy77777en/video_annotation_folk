    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot overlooking a vast, layered canyon under a turbulent sky. The scene is dominated by a powerful storm, with heavy, dark clouds filling the upper frame and casting deep shadows across the reddish-brown rock formations below. Visible sheets of rain fall from the clouds into the depths of the canyon, while distant areas are illuminated by shafts of sunlight, creating a high-contrast and moody atmosphere. There is no main subject in this shot; the focus is instead on the immense scale of the natural environment and the powerful, atmospheric weather conditions unfolding within it. The sheer size and grandeur of the landscape are emphasized by the expansive view and the dynamic interplay of light and shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
