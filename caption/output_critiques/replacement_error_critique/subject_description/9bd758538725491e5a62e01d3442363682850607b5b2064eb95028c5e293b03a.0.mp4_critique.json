There is no main subject because the focus is on the immersive environment of the trail itself, the lush foliage clinging to the steep hillside on the left, and the dense trees and undergrowth on the right, conveying the atmosphere and scale of the natural landscape rather than a specific entity. A lone hiker with a red backpack is seen ascending the path in the distance, but they serve more as an element within the scene, emphasizing the trail's use and scale, rather than being the central point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
