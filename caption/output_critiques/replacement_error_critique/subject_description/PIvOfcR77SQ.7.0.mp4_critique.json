    "pre_caption": "This is a winter landscape scenery shot capturing a serene, snow-covered rural property at twilight. The video pans across a vast expanse of deep, white snow, revealing several buildings including a small log cabin and a larger red house, both adorned with warm, festive string lights. Bare, skeletal trees stand against a cloudy, dusky sky, while a couple of parked cars and a snowmobile are partially buried in the snow. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the camera's sweeping motion is intended to capture the quiet, cold atmosphere and the picturesque quality of the entire snowy environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
