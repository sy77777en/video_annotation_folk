    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing the urban skyline against a dramatic sunset. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the environment. The composition emphasizes the interplay between the natural beauty of the sky and the man-made structures below, creating a mood of tranquil beauty. The sky is filled with a vast expanse of clouds, painted in warm hues of gold, orange, and soft yellow by the setting sun, contrasting with darker, purplish-grey tones higher up. Below, a silhouette of city buildings and lush, dark green trees stretches across the horizon, with some structures catching the last glimmers of sunlight, creating a serene and picturesque urban vista.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
