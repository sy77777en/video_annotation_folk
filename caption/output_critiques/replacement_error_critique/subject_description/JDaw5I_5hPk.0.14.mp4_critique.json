    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a vast and misty coastline. The scene is characterized by a muted, blue-gray color palette and a thick haze that softens the details, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Gentle waves with white crests wash over a wide, sandy beach, while in the distance, the dark, jagged silhouettes of large sea stacks and cliffs rise from the water and shore. The focus is on the immense scale and serene mood of the environment, with a couple of tiny, distant figures on the beach serving only to accentuate the vastness of the natural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
