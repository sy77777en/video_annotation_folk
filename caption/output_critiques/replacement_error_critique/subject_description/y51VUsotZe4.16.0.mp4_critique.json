    "pre_caption": "This video presents a nighttime aerial cityscape shot, beginning with a high, out-of-focus perspective that captures the sprawling urban expanse as a glittering field of bokeh lights against the dark sky. The camera then descends and tilts, gradually bringing a specific multi-lane street into focus. This thoroughfare is illuminated by streetlights and the glowing signs of low-rise commercial buildings, with a few cars moving along its length. The shot lacks a central subject, instead emphasizing the vast, atmospheric quality of the city at night, using the patterns of light and shadow to establish a sense of place and scale.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
