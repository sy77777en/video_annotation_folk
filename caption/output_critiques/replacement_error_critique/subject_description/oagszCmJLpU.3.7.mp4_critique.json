    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of an approaching storm rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky, where lighter, wispy blue and white clouds in the upper atmosphere give way to a massive, dark, and ominous storm cloud that stretches across the lower half of the sky. This deep blue-black cloud formation hangs low over the horizon, from which a concentrated column of rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a flat expanse of green farmland, marked by faint rows leading toward the storm, meets a horizon glowing with a soft orange light, creating a stark contrast with the dark weather system above. The shot's emphasis is on the powerful environmental display, capturing the feeling of being in the presence of a significant weather event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
