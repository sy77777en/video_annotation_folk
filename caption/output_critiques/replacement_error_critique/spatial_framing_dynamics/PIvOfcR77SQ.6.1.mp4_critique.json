    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a snowy, twilight landscape. Initially, a red building is positioned in the right foreground, with a snow-covered path extending from the bottom left foreground into the middle ground. Small, lit lanterns are placed in the foreground and middle ground along the path. In the middle ground, several bare trees and yurts are visible to the left and center, with a line of dark hills spanning the background. The camera then pans to the right, causing the initial red building to shift to the left side of the frame. This movement reveals a small, illuminated Christmas tree in the left middle ground and a second red building in the right middle ground, framing a wide, snowy area that fills the center. The camera maintains a consistent eye-level height throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene small town in a winter setting, featuring a few red houses covered in snow and a small Christmas tree adorned with lights, highlighting the cozy atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor winter setting during twilight, with a snow-covered landscape extending into the distance. The scene features a few bare trees scattered across the snowy terrain, their branches silhouetted against a cloudy sky. Initially, a red building with a sloped roof is visible on the right of the frame, adding a splash of color to the predominantly white environment. Warm light emanates from small light bulbs on its roof, creating a cozy contrast to the cold surroundings. As the camera pans to the right, more buildings with sloped roofs, some red and some gray, come into view, blending into the snowy backdrop. The atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the stillness of the winter scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
