    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot features a man and a woman slow dancing in the foreground. Initially, the woman is on the left side of the frame, with her back partially to the camera, while the man is on the right, in profile, facing her. As they dance, they slowly rotate counter-clockwise, causing their positions relative to the camera to shift continuously; the man moves from the right to the left and back, and the woman from the left to the right and back, with each alternately having their face or back more prominently displayed. Star-shaped decorations are visible in the top middle ground. In the background, fixed colored lights in red, green, and blue illuminate the scene, and strip decorations are faintly visible. A bright yellow-orange light source, often in the center-left or central area of the frame, creates a prominent lens flare that shifts as the subjects move. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with voluminous, golden, curly hair that reaches his shoulders is shown slow dancing with a woman. He wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bowtie, and a white flower corsage is pinned to his left lapel; he is smiling as he looks at the woman. The woman, who has long, straight, golden hair, wears a light-colored garment and looks back at the man as they dance closely.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An objective POV shot captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective, revealing an indoor, dimly lit nighttime dance or party setting where two figures slow dance. Star-shaped decorations made of reflective material hang from above, illuminated by fixed colored lights in red, yellow, green, and blue, each coming from different light sources. A prominent, bright yellow-orange light source creates a lens flare effect. The background features strip decorations in the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
