    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames two men on an interior balcony. A man with a buzz cut occupies the left foreground, shown in profile and facing right. In the right foreground, a younger man in a leather jacket faces him, gesturing with his right hand. In the middle ground, an ornate column is positioned in the center of the frame, with a stone balustrade running along the right side. The background shows another level of the building across an atrium on the right and an archway in the top-left. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a buzz cut and a serious expression is shown in profile, wearing a dark gray, long-sleeved shirt. He is facing a younger, light-skinned man with short, dark, curly hair. This second man wears a black leather jacket over a rust-colored collared shirt and is actively speaking, gesturing with his right hand as he talks to the first man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on an upper-level interior balcony of a large, classical-style building in a state of disrepair. The floor of the walkway is scattered with small stones and dust. Ornate, off-white columns with gold-leafed capitals featuring sculpted faces and spiral details stand prominently. A light-colored stone balustrade lines the edge of the balcony. The walls are a muted, pale green, and the space is illuminated by diffuse daylight. In the background, across an open atrium, another level of the building is visible, with off-white walls and windows on the right side. On the left side of the corridor, there appears to be an archway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
