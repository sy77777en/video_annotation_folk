    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, where an older woman is positioned in the middle ground, center, behind a weathered wooden gate that occupies the foreground, center. She holds an open umbrella. In the background, center-left, an older man stands in the doorway of a stone building, which is also in the background, left. Tall green grass is visible in the middle ground and background. As the woman begins to open the gate and walk forward, she moves from the middle ground towards the foreground. Simultaneously, the camera zooms in, transitioning the shot to a close-up of the woman, now in the foreground, center, still holding her umbrella. The wooden gate remains partially visible in the foreground, right, while the man and the stone building are still in the background, center-left and left respectively. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older woman with fair skin and greyish-blonde hair, wearing a colorful patterned headscarf tied under her chin, a light grey cardigan over a dark, patterned dress, and a dark bag hanging at her elbow, stands in the middle ground and then walks to the foreground. She holds a large, open umbrella with dark edges and a light-colored, intricate pattern, and is opening a weathered wooden gate to walk out. In the background, standing in the doorway of a stone building, is an older man with a white beard, wearing a dark shirt and holding a hunting rifle. He appears to be looking towards the woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a rural area during the daytime, featuring a wooden gate reminiscent of a courtyard fence prominently in the foreground. In the background, a stone cottage with weathered walls adds to the rustic charm of the setting. The landscape is lush with tall green grass and rolling hills, suggesting a serene countryside environment. An elderly man stands still in front of the stone cottage, while a woman stands by the gate, holding a patterned umbrella with a light blue and white design. She wears a light-colored cardigan and a headscarf. The overall atmosphere is calm, with soft natural lighting and a gentle breeze indicated by the slight movement of the grass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
