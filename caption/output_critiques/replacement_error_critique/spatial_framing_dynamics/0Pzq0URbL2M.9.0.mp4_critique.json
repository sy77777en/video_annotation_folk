    "pre_caption": "The video commences with a close-up shot, focusing on the left side of the first cylindrical container in the left foreground, its biohazard symbol partially visible. The camera then trucks left while panning right and simultaneously moving backward, transitioning the view to a full shot that reveals three containers. As the camera repositions, the first container, labeled \"Cholera,\" moves from the left foreground to the left middle ground. The second container, labeled \"Anthrax,\" enters the frame from the right foreground and settles in the center middle ground. Subsequently, the third container, labeled \"Typhoid,\" appears from the far-right foreground, moving to the right middle ground. In the final full shot, these three labeled containers are aligned side-by-side in the middle ground—\"Cholera\" to the left, \"Anthrax\" in the center, and \"Typhoid\" to the right—with an out-of-focus background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays three cylindrical, light-colored containers, likely off-white or light gray, arranged side-by-side. Each container features a metallic band encircling both the base and the top, along with a small, circular metallic fitting near the bottom. The surfaces of the containers appear worn, with smudges and possible rust spots. A black biohazard symbol is prominently printed on the side of each cylinder. Above this symbol, black text identifies the contents. The central container is labeled \"Anthrax - 炭疽\". To its left, another container is labeled \"Cholera - コレラ\". The container on the right is labeled \"Typhoid - チフス\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features a close-up, panning, and tracking shot of three cylindrical, off-white containers. Each container prominently displays a black biohazard symbol on its side. Above the biohazard symbol, text overlays in English and Japanese label the contents as \"Anthrax - 炭疽,\" \"Cholera - コレラ,\" and \"Typhoid - チフス.\" The containers have a slightly worn and rusted appearance, with visible metallic bands at the top and bottom. The background is dimly lit and out of focus, suggesting an indoor, possibly industrial or storage setting. The camera trucks left and pans right to adjust its orientation toward the containers while simultaneously moving backward. A white overlay user interface displaying the numbers [8, 10, 22, 23] is visible in the lower-left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
