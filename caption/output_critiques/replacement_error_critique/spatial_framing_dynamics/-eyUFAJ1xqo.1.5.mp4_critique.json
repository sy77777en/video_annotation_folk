    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the left middle ground and a man is in the center-right middle ground, both standing before a large, patterned wall that occupies the background. The scene is initially illuminated entirely in red light emanating from the wall. As the subjects dance subtly in place, the lighting on the right portion of the background wall transitions to blue, while the left side remains red. The camera is stationary and positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman stand close to each other in a dimly lit setting. The man has short dark hair and a full dark beard. He is wearing an unbuttoned black shirt, exposing his bare chest, and dark pants. The woman, positioned on the left side of the frame, might have her dark hair styled in a bun and is wearing a white, long-sleeved robe or shirt with black trim along the collar. They exchange glances and continue dancing together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, indoor space dominated by a wall with a repeating geometric pattern of stylized, eye-like shapes. The entire room is bathed in a deep red light, with the pattern on the wall backlit in the same red hue. As the scene progresses, a section of the wall's backlighting transitions to a vibrant blue, creating a stark contrast against the remaining red-lit areas. Two figures, one in light-colored clothing and the other in dark, are positioned in front of the wall, their forms largely silhouetted by the intense, shifting colors.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
