    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a laboratory, gradually transitioning to a wide shot. Initially, the man, dressed in a white lab coat, is positioned in the center-right of the frame, facing away from the camera. He stands at a counter in the middle ground, engaging with laboratory equipment. As the shot widens, more of the laboratory becomes visible. The man remains in the same position throughout the video, maintaining his focus on the task at hand. To the left of the frame, in the foreground, there is a brown table with a storage cabinet on top. Behind the man, in the background, a row of metal cabinets lines the left wall. The tiled walls and floor extend across the entire scene, with a round clock mounted on the wall near the top left. Two large windows are located on the right side of the frame, offering a view into another indoor space. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subject, capturing the laboratory environment comprehensively as the shot expands.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in a laboratory setting. He is wearing a white lab coat, black pants, and black shoes, and has short hair. The man is standing at a counter, facing away, and appears to be engaged in a task involving laboratory equipment. The room contains various scientific instruments and furniture, including a row of metal cabinets and a desk. The overall setting suggests a scientific or medical environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor laboratory setting with a clinical and organized atmosphere. The room features tiled walls and a tiled floor, creating a clean and sterile environment. There are lights on the ceiling. Metal cabinets line one side of the room, providing storage space. White tables and chairs are present, with brown storage cabinets on the tables, and a brown table is situated on the left side. A round clock is mounted on the wall. Two large windows reveal a view of another indoor space outside the room. The laboratory is equipped with various scientific instruments and equipment on the countertops, including microscopes and glassware. A person in a white lab coat is engaged in work at one of the counters, adding a sense of activity. Posters with human anatomy diagrams adorn the walls, indicating that this could be a medical laboratory and contributing to the educational and research-focused ambiance. The overall color scheme is neutral, with shades of gray and white dominating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
