    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a grassy field. Initially bent over while holding a large camera, she transitions into a low crouching position, remaining in the center. As she crouches, she raises the camera to her eye, aiming it toward the left side of the scene. The foreground and middle ground are filled with grass, while trees are visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman is in a grassy field, holding a large, black camera with a long telephoto lens. She is wearing a light-colored bucket hat, a long-sleeved shirt with a black-and-white camouflage pattern, and black pants. The woman transitions from a bent-over position to a low crouch, raising the camera to her eye and directing it towards the left side of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a grassy field with green and yellow blades of grass, a woman wearing a light-colored hat, a black-and-white patterned shirt, and black pants moves from a bent-over stance to a kneeling position. She holds a large, black telephoto camera lens, directing it towards the left side of the scene. The background is softly blurred, revealing a line of green trees and taller, slender trees under an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
