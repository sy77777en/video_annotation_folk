    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from an eye-level perspective, capturing a rainy city street at night. Initially, a red postbox occupies the right foreground, with the wet pavement reflecting lights across the bottom of the frame. Storefronts line the left side, while a road with cars is on the right. In the center-left middle ground, a person with an umbrella walks away from the camera. The camera then moves steadily forward along the sidewalk. As it advances, the person and the red postbox both move out of the frame, while the camera gets closer to a bus shelter located further down the path in the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a London street at night during a rain shower. The wet, dark pavement glistens, creating vivid, elongated reflections of the bright lights from street lamps and closed storefronts, which line the sidewalk. In the distance, the headlights of cars, including classic black London taxis, cut through the darkness, while a traditional red postbox stands prominently in the foreground. The focus remains on the overall environment and moody atmosphere, with the camera moving steadily down the sidewalk to capture the scale and ambiance of the rainy urban setting rather than highlighting a specific subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, the perspective moves forward along a wet city sidewalk at night. The dark, glossy pavement reflects the bright lights from the storefronts and streetlights, creating elongated, colorful streaks on the ground. The street is lined with multi-story buildings, and on the right, a bright red postbox stands on the curb next to a road with moving traffic, including black taxis. Further down the sidewalk, a red telephone booth or bus shelter is visible, and a person holding an umbrella walks away from the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
