    "pre_caption": "This is a static, full shot from a top-down perspective. A miniature rolling suitcase is positioned on the right side of the frame, lying flat in the foreground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A miniature, dark blue rolling suitcase is shown lying flat, featuring a top shaped like an arched trapezoid. The suitcase has two rectangular pockets on its front, each with a two-tone design: the lower section is a light grayish-blue, and the upper flap is a darker grayish-blue. The flaps are highlighted with prominent white stitching and a small, silver zipper pull for added detail. On either side of the bottom, small wheels are visible. The object appears to be a handmade model, possibly constructed from fabric or a similar textured material.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective, a miniature backpack is positioned on the right against a background of light-colored, vertical wooden slats. The backpack features a combination of dark blue and grayish-blue hues, detailed with two front pockets on the exterior, each secured with a dark blue flap. The wooden surface has a cool-toned, weathered texture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
