    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from a first-person perspective, with the front of a vehicle consistently occupying the bottom foreground of the frame. Initially, the scene is framed to show a wide grassy area, with a crowd behind a white barrier in the middle ground on the left and behind a red barrier that curves from the center to the right. A tall blue tower is visible in the background, positioned towards the center-left. As the camera moves forward, it approaches two men who are initially small figures in the center of the middle ground. The forward motion causes the men to grow larger in the frame, transitioning from a long shot to a medium shot where about half of their bodies are visible. Simultaneously, their position shifts from the center to the lower right corner of the frame. The camera maintains a height level with the subjects it approaches.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, the front of a vehicle is visible at the bottom of the view, with a pair of hands in black and white gloves gripping the handlebars. The rider's helmet features a prominent red and white \"Red Bull\" logo on a black and silver surface. The vehicle approaches two men standing on a grassy field. One man, who has light skin, short brown hair, and some facial scruff, wears a white short-sleeved t-shirt and holds a professional video camera with both hands. Standing beside him is another light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing a dark t-shirt and a baseball cap, who holds a long boom pole with a large, furry microphone at the end. A large crowd of spectators is visible in the background behind white and red barriers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves across a green, grassy field during the day under a cloudy sky. The area is lined with a low white barrier on the left and a similar low red barrier at the front and right. In front of the right barrier, there are stacked blue boxes featuring the Red Bull logo. A large crowd of spectators watches from behind the barriers. In the background, a tall blue tower structure with a platform on top is visible. Two men, one holding a camera and the other a boom microphone, stand on the grass. The view includes the top of the helmet with red and white \"Red Bull\" lettering.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video, shot from a first-person perspective, shows a motorcyclist riding. At the bottom of the frame, part of the rider’s hands gripping the handlebars is visible, with many spectators surrounding the area. As the motorcycle moves forward, it gradually approaches two people—one holding a camera and the other a boom microphone. They appear increasingly larger in the frame until about half of their bodies are visible in the lower right corner.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
