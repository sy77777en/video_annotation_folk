    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, two damaged race cars are initially positioned in the middle ground. A white #98 car is on the grass to the right of the frame's center, while a black and yellow #2 car is slightly behind it and to its left, also on the grass. As the camera pans left and zooms in slightly, both cars slide diagonally from the middle ground toward the bottom-left foreground. The white car comes to rest on the border between the grass and the track in the bottom-center of the frame, while the #2 car stops on the track just to its left and slightly further into the middle ground. The track itself curves from the bottom left up towards the top right, with a grassy infield occupying the center and right side of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases two main race cars on a track, both involved in a collision. The primary focus is on a white race car with a red number 98 prominently displayed on its side, featuring black designs on its rear and a blue \"Ford\" logo. This car has visible damage to its front bumper and is positioned adjacent to the track on the grass. The secondary subject is a black and yellow race car with the number 2, which is also damaged and trailing smoke, positioned slightly behind and to the left of the first car. Both cars are next to the track, indicating a recent impact, and their proximity highlights the aftermath of a high-speed racing event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a racetrack during an event, with lighting illuminating the area. The setting features a wide, paved track wrapping around a grassy area, bordered by a concrete wall, suggesting a professional racing environment. Two cars are prominently visible, both with noticeable damage, skidding across the grass and track. The cars display vibrant colors and sponsor logos, with smoke trailing from their movements, indicating recent collisions. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic motion and intensity, with tire marks visible on the track, adding to the sense of recent high-speed activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
