    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot captured from a static, low-angle camera position. In this extreme wide shot, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel is the central element, occupying the middle ground. The foreground at the bottom of the frame is a plaza where the blurred motion of people creates streaks, particularly on the left, while a more distinct group stands near the base of the arch on the right. In the middle ground, a portion of an illuminated building is visible on the left, and bare trees frame the monument on the right. The background consists of a dark sky with drifting clouds at the top of the frame and distant city lights, including a Ferris wheel visible through one of the archways. A prominent streetlight on the far left creates a starburst effect, and a text overlay is positioned in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic cityscape scenery shot of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris at night. The monument, with its intricate carvings and a bronze quadriga sculpture on top, is brightly illuminated against the dark sky, where clouds drift by. The surrounding plaza is dotted with streetlights that create a starburst effect, and the blurred motion of people walking around the base of the arch indicates a time-lapse or long-exposure technique. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the grand atmosphere and architectural scale of the iconic landmark. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of a bustling yet timeless Parisian night, rather than on any individual person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime time-lapse captures the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris. The monument, constructed from pink and white stone, is brightly illuminated against a dark sky where clouds are seen drifting. It features multiple arches, detailed carvings, and is crowned by a bronze quadriga sculpture. To the left, a portion of the illuminated Louvre Palace is visible, while bare trees and distant city lights, including a Ferris wheel, are seen in the background. People are gathered around the base of the arch, their movements creating blurred trails across the sandy plaza. A prominent streetlight on the left creates a starburst effect. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"MATHIEU STANIĆ CINEMATOGRAPHER\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
