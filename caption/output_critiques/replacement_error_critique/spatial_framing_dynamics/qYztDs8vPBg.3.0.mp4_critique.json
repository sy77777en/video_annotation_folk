    "pre_caption": "The video is a close-up shot featuring two smartphones and a pair of hands. The first smartphone is located on the left side of the frame, displaying a digital clock and date, while the second smartphone is on the right, showing a world clock. Both phones are in the foreground, with the second phone slightly closer to the viewer. The hands, positioned centrally in the frame, manipulate a transparent screen protector over the second smartphone. The left hand, adorned with a ring, holds the screen protector, while the right hand uses a tool. The screen protector is initially intact but is bent, revealing a cracked pattern. Various colorful objects, including pen-like screwdrivers and a lighter, are scattered around the edges of the frame, primarily in the background. The camera remains stationary, positioned directly above the subjects, providing a clear overhead view of the actions taking place. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two smartphones and a pair of hands. The first smartphone on the left displays a digital clock with the time 11:46 and a date, set against a gold and blue background. The second smartphone on the right shows a world clock with times for Cupertino and New York. The hands, with a light skin tone, are manipulating a transparent screen protector over the second smartphone. The person is wearing a ring on the left hand and holding a tool in the right hand. The screen protector, which was already removed at the beginning of the video, is being bent, causing it to reveal a cracked pattern.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an overhead POV shot, capturing a close-up view of a tabletop setting. The environment is indoors, with a focus on two smartphones placed on a flat surface. The time of day is indicated by the phone screens, showing a digital clock display. One phone shows a date and time, while the other displays a world clock with different time zones. The scene includes a pair of hands interacting with a transparent, flexible material, possibly a screen protector, which is being manipulated above one of the phones. The tabletop is cluttered with various colorful objects, including multiple pen-like screwdrivers, a lighter, and other items, adding to the casual, everyday setting. The lighting is bright, providing clear visibility of the objects and actions within the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
