    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, features a young man in a wheelchair positioned in the center-right foreground, holding a basketball. Behind him, in the center-left middle ground, a young woman stands and dances. In the background, a chain-link fence and dense green trees span the frame, with a basketball hoop visible on the far right. The camera remains static throughout the clip, maintaining a consistent focus as the man moves his upper body and the ball within his space, and the woman dances energetically behind him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with light skin and short brown hair, wearing a purple hoodie, sits in a wheelchair, actively moving his upper body and arms in a playful manner while holding an orange basketball with black lines. Behind him, a young woman with light skin and blonde hair, wearing a light purple sweatshirt, light-wash jeans, and a black baseball cap, dances and cheers with her arms raised. The man looks forward with concentration, while the woman smiles and moves energetically.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an outdoor basketball court during the daytime. A tall, green chain-link fence separates the court from a dense background of leafy green trees. The court itself has a dark, paved surface. To the right, a portion of a basketball hoop with a white backboard and a blue support pole is visible. In the foreground, a young man in a purple hoodie sits in a wheelchair, holding an orange basketball with black lines. A young woman wearing a light purple sweatshirt, blue jeans, and a black baseball cap stands behind him.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
