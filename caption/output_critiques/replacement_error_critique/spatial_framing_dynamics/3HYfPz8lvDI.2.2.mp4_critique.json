    "pre_caption": "The video clip begins as a wide shot, captured from a high angle above the subject, and remains static throughout. A wooden lounge chair with white cushioning is centrally positioned in the middle ground. It rests on a light gray, textured pool deck that occupies the majority of the frame, also in the middle ground. Portions of a swimming pool, featuring blue water and mosaic-tiled edges, are visible in the bottom left, bottom right, and along the left edge of the frame, bordering the deck in the middle ground. The chair casts a shadow towards the top left on the deck. No change in shot size or framing is observed during this clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a wooden lounge chair with white, segmented cushioning. The chair is positioned on a light gray, textured surface next to a swimming pool. The visible portions of the pool reveal blue water and are lined with blue and white mosaic tiles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene features a single wooden lounge chair with white, quilted cushioning, positioned on a light gray, textured concrete pool deck. The chair casts a distinct shadow, indicating bright sunlight. Adjacent to the deck, a swimming pool with clear blue water is visible, its edges lined with small, square, blue and white mosaic tiles.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
