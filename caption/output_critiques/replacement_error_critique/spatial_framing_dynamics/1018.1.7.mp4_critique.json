    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two men walking through a train corridor. The primary subject, a man in a green and red cap, white shirt, dark vest, and tie, is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, holding a small tree wrapped in netting. His 2D position shifts slightly from the center-left towards the center as he moves forward. In the background, another man wearing a Santa hat and dark coat follows closely behind, maintaining a consistent 2D position slightly to the left of the central figure. Both subjects remain in the middle ground throughout the video. The corridor's soft green walls and linear ceiling design form the backdrop, with doors on the left and windows on the right. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level, capturing their forward motion without any noticeable change in shot size or angle. The overall spatial framing emphasizes the movement of the two men along the corridor, with the camera keeping pace to maintain their positions within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in a train corridor, wearing a green and red cap, a white shirt, and a dark vest with a tie. He has a mustache and is holding a small tree wrapped in netting. Behind him, another man is visible, wearing a Santa hat and a dark coat. The first man appears to be walking forward, with a focused expression, while the second man follows closely.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set inside a train carriage with a vintage design, featuring soft green walls and a narrow corridor. The lighting is bright and evenly distributed, suggesting daytime. The ceiling has a sleek, linear design with subtle lighting fixtures. The environment is clean and orderly, with smooth surfaces and a polished finish. On the right side, there are windows that allow natural light to stream in, while the left side features doors. A person in a uniform, holding a netted bundle, walks through the corridor, accompanied by another individual wearing a Santa hat. The scene conveys a sense of movement as they proceed down the aisle, with the train's interior providing a structured and enclosed setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
