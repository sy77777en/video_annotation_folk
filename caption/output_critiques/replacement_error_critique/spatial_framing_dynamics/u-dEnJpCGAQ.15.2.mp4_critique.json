    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of a group of lions resting on a reddish-brown surface. The central lioness is positioned in the center foreground, with her front paws extended forward and her head initially turned to the left before facing forward. Behind her, three other lionesses are partially visible, positioned closely together in the middle ground, creating a sense of cohesion. The background is softly blurred, with greenery visible, emphasizing the natural setting. The camera is at the lions' level, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of lions resting closely together. The central subject is a lioness with a light tan coat and a white underbelly, lying down with her front paws extended forward. Her ears are perked up, and she initially turns her head to look towards the left side of the frame before turning back to gaze directly ahead with a calm expression. Behind her, partially visible, are three other lionesses, also with similar tan coats. They are positioned closely, suggesting a sense of cohesion and restfulness among the group. The lions are lying on a reddish-brown surface, which contrasts with their fur, highlighting their presence in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a natural environment, likely a savannah or grassland, during the early evening or late afternoon. The scene features a group of lions resting on a patch of reddish-brown earth, with small sprouts scattered in front of them. The lions, with their tawny fur and relaxed postures, are the central focus, lying close together, suggesting a sense of calm and unity. The background is softly blurred, with lush greenery visible in the distance, emphasizing the tranquility of the setting. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the natural colors of the landscape and the lions' coats. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with no visible movement or disturbances, allowing the viewer to appreciate the quiet beauty of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
