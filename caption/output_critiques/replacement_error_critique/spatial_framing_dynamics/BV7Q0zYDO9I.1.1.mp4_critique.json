    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, shows four white figures and a chair arranged in a dark, reflective space. In the center middle ground, a figure is seated on a chair. To the right and slightly behind the seated figure, another figure stands in the middle ground holding a rifle-like object. In the background to the left, a third figure also stands holding a similar object. A fourth figure stands on the far left in the middle ground, positioned between the seated and background figures. The dark floor creates reflections of all the figures directly below them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stark, black-and-white scene, four stylized, white male figures are present. In the center, a figure wearing a white polo shirt with dark markings, a matching cap, pants, and sneakers is seated on a white chair, leaning forward with his head bowed. To his right, a standing figure in a white polo shirt, pants, and sneakers holds a dark, rifle-like object. To the left of the seated figure, another standing man, dressed similarly in a white polo shirt and pants, also holds a dark, rifle-like object. To the far left, a fourth figure, wearing a white t-shirt and shorts, stands with his head bowed and his back partially turned. All figures have a smooth, mannequin-like appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a completely black, undefined space, four white, mannequin-like figures are arranged under a spotlight. The floor is highly reflective, creating distorted mirror images of the figures below them. One figure sits hunched over in a simple white chair at the center, while another stands to the left with its head bowed. Two other standing figures, positioned in the background and to the right, hold brown, rifle-like objects. The scene is rendered in a stark black-and-white style, with the brown objects being the only exception. An overlay in the form of a white subtitle at the bottom of the screen reads, \"[5].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
