    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man in a clown mask is positioned in the foreground, occupying the left and center of the frame. In the middle ground on the right, another man in a clown mask is driving the car. A third masked man is partially visible in the background on the far left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level from within the vehicle, maintaining a stable frame on the car's occupants as the scenery passes by outside the windows.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Inside a car, three men are visible, each wearing a distinct clown mask. The man in the front passenger seat is in profile, facing right. His white mask features a high white nose with blue accents, blue makeup around the eyes, and red lips painted in a wide, slightly downturned smile. Dark hair is visible at the back of his head, and he wears a dark collared garment. The man in the driver's seat, also wearing a white clown mask with blue eye makeup and a wide red smile, has a tuft of spiky, light-colored hair atop his mask. He is dressed in a dark blue suit jacket over a dark-colored collared shirt and occasionally turns his head to watch both sides. In the back seat, another man is partially visible, wearing a clown mask with less distinct features due to distance and focus, and a similar suit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a moving vehicle, likely a car or van, during the daytime. The interior is dimly lit, with the primary light source coming from the windows, which show a blurred, out-of-focus view of an urban or suburban environment passing by. The steering wheel is visible in the middleground. The overall atmosphere is somewhat dark and confined within the vehicle.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
