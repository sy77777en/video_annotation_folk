    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. She holds a silver tool in her right hand, located in the lower-left of the frame, and a gold balloon in her left hand, located in the center-right. A chain-link fence is visible in the middle ground directly behind her, with dense green trees filling the background. The balloon, initially intact, pops in slow motion, and a spray of water erupts from its position, expanding outward primarily towards the right side of the frame. The camera remains stationary and at the woman's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair stands facing forward with a neutral expression. She wears a yellow, floral-print top with short, puffy sleeves. In her left hand, she holds a gold-colored balloon, which is initially inflated and then pops, spraying water. In her right hand, she holds a silver-colored pneumatic tool, its nozzle pressed against the balloon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors during the day, with a chain-link fence positioned in front of a background of dense green trees. In the foreground, a woman in a yellow floral top holds a gold-colored balloon and a silver air tool. The balloon, initially inflated, is popped, causing a spray of water to erupt in slow motion, creating a mist of fine droplets in the air.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
