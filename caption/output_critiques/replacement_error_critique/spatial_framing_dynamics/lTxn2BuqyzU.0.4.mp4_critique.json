    "pre_caption": "This abstract video opens with a central, vertical, curving red tube. A small, dark, teardrop-shaped object is positioned on the upper-right side of this tube and moves downwards. The scene then cuts to a wider view of a red, cavernous space, where a pool of yellow liquid fills the bottom of the frame. An unseen object strikes the liquid from the top center, causing several light-yellow fragments to splash upwards into the middle of the frame before they descend back into the pool. The camera remains stationary and at a straight-on angle in both views.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This animated video presents an abstract depiction of a process within a red, organic-looking environment. A small, dark brown, teardrop-shaped object is shown moving through a smooth, curving red tube. The scene then shifts to the interior of a larger, cavernous red space, which contains a pool of opaque, yellowish-tan liquid at the bottom. Initially, the surface of the liquid is undisturbed. The teardrop-shaped object strikes the liquid, causing droplets to splash upwards, forming several small, light-yellow fragments, including two crescent shapes and a tiny dot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, animated environment with deep red, curved, and organic walls, a small, dark, teardrop-shaped object moves down a narrow, vertical passage. The scene then shifts to a wider, cavernous space, where the bottom is filled with a pool of a textured, yellowish substance. As the teardrop-shaped object strikes the pool, it creates several small, light-yellow, crescent-shaped splashes that settle into the yellow pool below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
