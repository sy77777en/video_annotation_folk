    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective level with the subject, the shot is framed as a close-up on the car's front wheel and fender, which occupy the left foreground. The camera remains locked in this position relative to the car. The paved road stretches from the bottom of the frame in the foreground towards the background on the right. In the middle ground, a guardrail on the right side of the frame moves rapidly past the camera. Beyond the guardrail, in the background on the right, a line of trees and terrain is visible beneath a blue sky that fills the top right of the frame. The forward motion of the car causes the road and scenery to blur and appear to rush from the right side of the frame towards the left, with motion lines converging in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The primary subject is a red and white car, viewed from a level-angle perspective in front of its front wheel. The wheel has a black rim with a gold-colored center cap. The black tire is marked with a golden pattern on its sidewall, which forms a golden stripe when the tire spins rapidly. The visible portion of the car's body includes a bright red front fender and a white section further back, with a red rear spoiler also in view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted low on the side of a vehicle, the front wheel of a red and white race car spins rapidly as it speeds along a paved road. The outdoor setting is a sunlit, rural landscape with pine trees and rocky terrain bordering the road, which is lined with a guardrail. The sky is bright blue with a few white clouds. The high speed of the car creates a strong motion blur effect on the road surface and the passing guardrail.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is mounted on the side of a car, showing a close-up of the wheel and part of the side, while the right side of the frame reveals more of the scene in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
