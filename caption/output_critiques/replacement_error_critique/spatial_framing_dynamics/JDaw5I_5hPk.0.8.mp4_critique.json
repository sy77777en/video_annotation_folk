    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a turbulent seascape, viewed from an overhead perspective. A dark, moss-covered rock is centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the middle ground. Turbulent ocean water, a mix of blue-green hues, fills the surrounding frame, extending from the foreground to the background. Waves surge dynamically across the frame, primarily from the bottom and sides, breaking against and washing over the centrally located rock. This interaction generates significant white foam, which is most prominent in the foreground and middle ground as it engulfs and recedes from the rock. The rock remains static, providing a fixed point against the continuous, energetic motion of the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a coastal nature scenery shot, capturing ocean waves crashing against a dark, moss-covered rock, with seawater partially covering the rock. The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the dynamic and atmospheric display of natural forces, highlighting the raw power and texture of the sea. From an overhead perspective, foamy white water surges and breaks over the irregular, partially submerged rock, contrasting with the surrounding blue-green hues of the turbulent ocean, creating a scene of constant motion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a daytime seascape of turbulent ocean water vigorously crashing against a prominent, dark rock. The rock, irregular in shape and with a rough texture, displays patches of green on its dark surface. Waves of turquoise and deeper blue water surge around and break over the rock, generating significant white foam and spray in a continuous, dynamic motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
