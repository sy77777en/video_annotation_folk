    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up on an intercom system positioned in the right foreground, with several blurred figures visible in the background. A person then enters the frame from the left, moving toward the center to interact with the intercom. As they do, the shot transitions to a medium close-up of the person, who now occupies the center of the frame. The camera's focus shifts from the intercom in the foreground to the person, while the camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a close-up on a dark, wall-mounted intercom system featuring a circular, perforated speaker grille and a single, light-colored button. As a buzzing sound is heard, several people in the blurred background stand up and look toward the intercom. Following this, a person with dark skin and short, dark, textured hair, wearing a dark, possibly green, jacket, enters the frame from the right. This person reaches out with their right hand and presses the button on the intercom, causing the buzzing to stop. The camera's focus then shifts from the intercom to the person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor space cast in a greenish hue from overhead fluorescent lights, a dark, metallic intercom box is mounted on a post in the foreground. The box features a circular speaker grille, a single round button, and visible wiring at the top. The background is out of focus, but as the persistent buzzing sound is heard, several individuals who were seated stand up and focus their attention on the intercom. A person with dark skin and short, dark, textured hair, wearing a dark—possibly green—jacket, enters the frame in the middle ground from the right side. This person approaches the intercom and presses the button, silencing the noise.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
