    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center foreground, holding a laundry basket at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a row of washing machines spans the width of the scene, with a painting hanging on the center wall directly behind the man and a green light positioned behind his head. The shot then transitions to a medium close-up, tightening the frame on the man who remains centered. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a large, curly afro, a mustache, and a goatee is shown from the chest up, facing forward with his mouth open. He wears a bright orange, textured, long-sleeved sweater and a silver chain necklace with a circular pendant. He is holding a white laundry basket filled with light-colored clothing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a laundromat with deep blue walls, illuminated by a cool, greenish-blue ambient light. A row of white and light-blue washing machines lines the background, with bottles of laundry detergent placed on top. A large, rectangular landscape painting depicting green trees hangs on the central wall. A bright green light source is positioned behind a person wearing an orange-red sweater, who stands in the center holding a white laundry basket filled with clothes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
