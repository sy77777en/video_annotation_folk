    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot featuring multiple figures arranged with significant depth. In the foreground, the backs of several seated figures occupy the bottom left and bottom right of the frame. The central focus is in the middle ground, where a single figure stands in the center, facing away from the camera. This individual is positioned before a line of standing figures, also in the middle ground, who are illuminated and face forward. Among them, a prominent figure with arms crossed is located in the center-right. The composition creates a clear aisle on the tiled floor between the two rows of seated figures, leading the eye from the foreground to the central confrontation in the middle ground, all set against a dark background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a central figure, a man standing confidently with arms crossed, wearing a light-colored suit. He is positioned prominently in the center, illuminated by a focused light, which highlights his authoritative presence. Behind him, several other figures are standing in a line, dressed in similar attire, contributing to a formal or observational setting. In front of the central figure, one individual is positioned with his head down, facing him. All the figures appear to be wearing the same color, with shadows creating the illusion of variation. The overall composition suggests a scene of focus and attention on the central figure, with the surrounding individuals contributing to a structured and formal atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting with a monochromatic color scheme, primarily in shades of gray. The environment resembles a dimly lit room with a tiled floor, where several figures are positioned. In the foreground, seated figures face a group of standing figures in the middle ground. Contrary to the initial description, the standing figures are mostly arranged in a line, with two figures prominently illuminated in the center. One of these figures is facing the line, while the other is positioned to the front right of the figure facing the line. The seated figures are in shadow, creating a contrast with the lit background. The room's atmosphere is subdued, with minimalistic design elements. An overlay in the bottom left corner of the video reads \"[26]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
