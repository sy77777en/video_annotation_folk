    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a white ceramic toilet viewed from a top-down perspective, centered within the frame against a dark, monochromatic gradient background. Initially, the toilet is shown with the seat down and the lid upright, occupying the center of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned directly above the toilet, providing a clear view of its rounded seat and rectangular tank. As the video progresses, the lid smoothly lowers to cover the seat, maintaining its central position within the frame. The spatial dynamics remain consistent, with the toilet staying in the foreground and the camera angle unchanged, emphasizing the lid's movement while the rest of the scene remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a white ceramic toilet with a rounded seat and a rectangular tank, viewed from above. The toilet lid is initially upright, revealing the seat and bowl, and then the lid is lowered to cover the bowl. The toilet has a smooth, glossy surface and a standard design, with the seat and lid both matching in color and material. The orientation of the toilet remains consistent throughout the video, and no other objects or subjects are present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective, a 3D-animated white toilet is centered within a spotlight against a dark, monochromatic gradient background. The toilet is initially shown with its seat down and lid in the upright position. In a smooth motion, the lid lowers onto the seat, closing completely. The entire scene is rendered in a simple, grayscale style.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
