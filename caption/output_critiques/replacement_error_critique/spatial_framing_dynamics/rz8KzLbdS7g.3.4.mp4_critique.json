    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, eye-level scenery shot. Initially, a traditional Japanese building with a dark, gridded wooden facade occupies the right side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. A narrow paved street is positioned on the left, leading into the background. Other houses and fences line the left side of the street in the middle ground, with a red and white communications tower visible in the distant background. A silver car is partially visible under a carport in the foreground on the far right. The camera takes a few steps forward and then pans to the left, shifting the composition so that the narrow street becomes the central focus, leading the view deeper into the neighborhood. As a result of the pan, the building on the right moves to the edge of the frame, and the houses on the left become more prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential street lined with traditional Japanese houses. The buildings feature distinct architectural elements, such as wooden facades and tiled roofs, which contribute to the cultural atmosphere. The street is narrow and flanked by neatly trimmed greenery, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Overhead, a network of power lines crisscrosses the sky, emphasizing the blend of modern infrastructure with traditional aesthetics. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the harmonious coexistence of architecture and nature rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, initially moves forward slowly for two steps before gently panning to the left along a tranquil residential street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. On the right stands a traditional two-story building with a white upper section and a distinctive lower wall composed of weathered, dark brown wooden panels arranged in a grid pattern. The narrow paved road is bordered by other houses with tiled roofs, manicured trees, and low fences. Overhead, a clear blue sky is crisscrossed by numerous utility wires, and a red and white communications tower is visible in the distance. A silver car is partially parked under a carport to the right. After the pan, the camera continues advancing in the same direction along the narrow path.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
