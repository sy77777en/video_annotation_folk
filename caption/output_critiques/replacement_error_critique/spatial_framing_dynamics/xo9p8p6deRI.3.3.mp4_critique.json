    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a man in a gray suit who occupies the foreground. To his left and slightly behind him in the middle ground, another man is partially visible. On the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, a man in a white cap raises a camera into a shooting position. As this happens, the main subject, who was initially looking down, lifts his head to look forward. The camera remains static at the subjects' eye level throughout the shot. A non-diegetic text overlay is located in the bottom right of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man in a gray suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie, who appears to be the main subject. He has medium-length dark hair with a small patch of gray at the front and a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in a serious activity, possibly speaking or reading. To his left, a man with a beard and long hair, wearing a white cap backwards and a casual white shirt, holds a camera, indicating he is capturing the event. Another man, partially visible, stands behind the main subject, dressed in a light blue collared shirt, adding to the sense of a public or press event. The main subject's demeanor and attire contrast with the more casual appearance of the secondary subjects, highlighting his central role.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a formal or professional gathering, likely indoors, as suggested by the well-lit scene that indicates daytime. The background features a light-colored wall, contributing to a neutral atmosphere. A person in a gray suit is prominently positioned in the foreground, indicating a central focus. The suit is complemented by a patterned tie, adding a touch of color. In the background, other individuals are present, one of whom holds a camera, suggesting a press or media event. The video includes overlay text displaying the name \"Robert Kardashian\" in white letters on a black background at the bottom right, which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
