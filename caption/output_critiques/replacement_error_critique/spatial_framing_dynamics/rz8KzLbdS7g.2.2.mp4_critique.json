    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a residential neighborhood, capturing an expansive view of the environment. The camera starts with a narrow alleyway, where two buildings frame the scene on the left and right sides. The building on the left occupies the left side of the frame in the foreground, while the brown building is on the right. As the camera moves forward, the alley opens up, revealing more of the street and the traditional house in the background. This house, with its red-tiled roof and wooden upper structure, is centered in the frame and positioned in the middle ground. A concrete wall runs along the front of the house, spanning from the left to the right side of the frame. Two posters are affixed to this wall, located near the center-right of the frame. Greenery, including a bush with red flowers, is situated in the middle ground, slightly to the right of the center. Power lines stretch across the top of the frame, connecting the buildings. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned at eye level relative to the surroundings, providing a steady and clear view of the scene throughout the video. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position; the camera smoothly transitions from the confined alley to the open street, maintaining a continuous and stable perspective",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a small neighborhood scene, featuring a narrow street flanked by buildings with a traditional house in the middle ground. The focus is on the environment, highlighting architectural details like the red-tiled roof and wooden elements of the house. The street in the foreground is bordered by a concrete wall adorned with posters, while visible power lines above ground connect the buildings. Greenery adds a touch of nature, emphasizing the atmosphere and setting, and showcasing the blend of urban and traditional elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a quiet, sunlit alley in a residential area, characterized by traditional Japanese architecture. Initially, the setting is outdoors with narrow pathways bordered by slightly taller buildings with textured walls, one white and the other brown. As the scene progresses, the road ahead opens up, becoming less confined. A prominent element is a house with a red-tiled roof and wooden upper structure, partially obscured by a concrete wall adorned with colorful posters. Lush green foliage, including a bush with small red flowers, adds a natural touch to the urban environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, with no visible movement or activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
