    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of an elderly man positioned on the right side of the frame. A dark stone wall occupies the foreground on the left, while the man stands in the middle ground within a doorway. In the background, the dim interior of the building and a window are visible. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly pushes in, transitioning the shot to a close-up that tightens the frame on the man's face, which remains slightly to the right of the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An elderly man with pale, wrinkled skin is shown from the chest up. He is balding on top with wispy, unkempt white hair on the sides of his head. He has a very large, bushy, and wild white beard and mustache that covers the lower half of his face. He is wearing a simple grey Henley-style shirt. His expression is one of concern or surprise, with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth as he looks off-camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at the entrance of a building with dark, textured stone walls. An elderly man with a prominent white beard stands within the doorway, looking outward. The environment is characterized by a cool, desaturated color palette, lending a muted tone to the setting. Beyond the man, the interior of the building is dimly lit, with the white panes of a window visible in the background. A gentle breeze is evident, subtly moving the man's wispy hair and beard.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
