    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot. A reddish-brown bridge dominates the middle ground, extending diagonally from the bottom left towards the top right of the frame. A convoy of military vehicles travels across this bridge from right to left. The river flows beneath the bridge, filling the majority of the frame. In the bottom right foreground, an orange tour boat moves towards the right. Further back in the middle ground, to the left of the bridge, a larger white tour boat and smaller speedboats navigate the water, moving away from the camera's position. The left riverbank occupies the bottom left foreground and middle ground, while the right bank is visible in the middle ground to the right of the bridge. The background is composed of distant trees and buildings. The camera remains static, providing a comprehensive overview of the scene from an elevated viewpoint.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a high-angle cityscape scenery shot overlooking a wide, dark river flowing through a city. A prominent reddish-brown bascule bridge, distinguished by its truss structure and two stone control towers located at each end, spans the water, with a convoy of tan military vehicles crossing it from right to left. The river is active with various watercraft, including a bright orange tour boat filled with passengers in the foreground, a larger white tour boat further back, and smaller speedboats leaving white wakes on the surface. The shot lacks a single main subject; its elevated and wide perspective is used to establish the scale of the urban environment and the juxtaposition of civilian leisure and military movement. The focus is on the overall atmosphere of the scene rather than any specific character or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a daytime scene over a wide, dark green river flowing through a city. A reddish-brown, metal truss bascule bridge spans the water, featuring stone control houses with tiled roofs at both ends. A convoy of tan military vehicles is in motion on the bridge. In the river below, several boats, including a large two-decker tour boat and a smaller orange vessel, move through the water, leaving wakes behind them. The riverbanks consist of a paved road and walkway on one side and a patch of grass and dirt on the other, with trees and buildings visible in the background under a clear sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
