    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot filmed at the subjects' level. In the foreground, the upper body of a person in green scrubs is positioned on the left side of the frame, viewed from behind. In the middle ground, a person in red lies horizontally on an examination table that extends from the center to the right. The person in red's bandaged right leg is elevated, stretching diagonally from the center toward the top right corner. Spanning the top of the frame in the background is an illuminated light box displaying several X-rays. The framing remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, viewed from behind, stands in the foreground wearing light green medical scrubs and a matching green bandana over their hair. On their back is a unique backpack designed to look like a miniature green soccer field, complete with white lines and a small, white soccer goal at the top. In front of them, another person lies on their back on a white examination table, dressed in a red long-sleeved shirt, red shorts, and a red calf sock on their left leg. This person's right leg is elevated and suspended in the air, wrapped in a thick white bandage or cast that extends from their foot to just below their knee.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is set in a dimly lit medical room lined with light blue curtains. In the background, a long, illuminated light box displays several X-ray images of bones. A person in red shorts and red socks lies on an examination table, their right leg elevated and wrapped in a white bandage, suspended by a hook from an overhead bar. Standing with their back to the camera is a figure wearing light blue scrubs, a matching green bandana over their hair, and a backpack designed to look like a miniature green soccer field, complete with white lines and a small white goal at the top.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a hospital-like setting with a person in red lying on a hospital bed, one leg wrapped in bandages and suspended in the air. The video is filmed from behind a person in green, whose upper body appears in the foreground, partially blocking the upper body of the person in red.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
