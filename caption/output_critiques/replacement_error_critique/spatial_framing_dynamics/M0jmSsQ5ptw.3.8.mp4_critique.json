    "pre_caption": "The video is captured in a static medium shot, focusing on an outdoor experimental setup. A large, white, fabric-covered structure dominates the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. Positioned in the right foreground and middle ground is a tall wooden rig. A system of ropes and straps connects the two structures across the lower portion of the frame. On the white structure, a green pouch hangs in the upper left and a black pouch is situated lower down, both in the middle ground. A thin, red laser line is projected horizontally across the center of the frame, from the white structure to the wooden one. The background, visible on the right, consists of a fence and a field in the middle ground, with distant hills under a cloudy sky. The primary action involves a small black ball rolling down a ramp on the wooden structure, moving from the upper right toward the center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an outdoor experimental setup. On the right, a tall, freestanding structure is constructed from light-colored wooden planks, featuring a wide triangular base and a central vertical post with attached horizontal and diagonal braces. A small, black, spherical ball rolls down this wooden structure. To the left stands a large, rectangular object completely covered in a white, canvas-like fabric. Various pieces of equipment are attached to the side of this white structure, including a green pouch hanging from a carabiner near the top, a black pouch positioned lower down, and an assortment of black and yellow ropes and straps.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set in a dry, open area with dirt and asphalt ground. In the middle ground, a chain-link fence separates the area from a field of dry brush, with low hills visible in the distance under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, a large, white, fabric-covered rectangular structure stands next to a tall, freestanding wooden rig made of light-colored lumber. A system of black and yellow ropes, straps, and pulleys connects the two structures. A green bag hangs from the side of the white structure, attached with a carabiner, while a black bag is attached with a rope. A thin, horizontal red rope connects the white wall and the wooden rig.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wooden experimental setup in an outdoor setting. It focuses on part of the setup, with a ball rolling down from the top. On the left side of the frame, there’s an object covered with white fabric, and in the background on the right, mountains, fields, and the sky are visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
