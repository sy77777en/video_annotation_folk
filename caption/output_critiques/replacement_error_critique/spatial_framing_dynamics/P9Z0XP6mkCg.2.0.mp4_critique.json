    "pre_caption": "The video is filmed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, positioned from the left rear of a humanoid subject. This blurred subject occupies the right foreground, with only the upper half of their body visible. The central focus is the computer monitor, which is positioned in the center middle ground and is fully in view. In the left foreground, a sandwich on a plate sits on the desk. To the left of the monitor, in the middle ground, stands a computer tower. A light source is visible in the right middle ground, behind the subject. The entire scene is set against a blue curtain in the background. A text overlay reading \"wikipedia.org\" is fixed in the bottom left corner of the frame. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a stylized, white humanoid figure is shown sitting at a desk and using a computer. The figure, which is out of focus, has a smooth surface and is visible from the upper back. The central focus is a black Sony computer monitor displaying a Wikipedia article for \"Alan MacMasters,\" which features a black-and-white portrait of a man with dark hair. To the left of the monitor, a sandwich rests on a small blue plate on the wooden desk. A black computer tower stands to the far left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a white, stylized figure sits at a wooden desk in a room. The figure's hands are poised in front of a black Sony computer monitor displaying a Wikipedia article for \"Alan MacMasters,\" complete with text and a small portrait. A prominent light source, likely a lamp, is on the right side. To the left of the monitor, a black computer tower is visible, and a sandwich rests on a light blue plate. The background features a blue curtain. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"wikipedia.org\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed from the left rear side of a humanoid subject, showing them using a computer. The subject is blurred and positioned on the right side of the frame, with only half of their upper body visible. The computer screen, fully visible and in focus, occupies the center of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
