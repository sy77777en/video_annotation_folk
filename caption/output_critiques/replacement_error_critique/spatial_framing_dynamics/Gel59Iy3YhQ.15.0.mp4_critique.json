    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, high-angle shot of a video game level. The main gameplay area, consisting of several kitchen platforms, occupies the middle ground of the frame, surrounded by dark water. In the background, dark silhouettes of trees are visible. Two small chef characters are present; one in a red shirt is positioned on a platform in the top right, while another in a blue shirt is on a platform in the bottom center. Overlaid in the foreground are recipe cards at the top, a score in the bottom left, and a timer in the bottom right. During the clip, the blue-shirted chef moves from the center to the right side of the bottom platform, while the red-shirted chef moves from the right side to the center of the top right platform and then back again.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a video game, two cartoonish chef characters are visible. Both are wearing classic white chef hats. One character is dressed in red, while the other in blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video shows a chaotic kitchen level set at night, where the entire character is visible on screen. The kitchen is composed of several stone-tiled platforms with red trim, separated by dark purple water filled with bright green lily pads. The scene is illuminated by glowing red, square-shaped lanterns scattered around the platforms, creating a whimsical ambiance. In the foreground, dark silhouettes of trees are visible. Small, cartoonish chef characters navigate the platforms, which are equipped with cooking stations, sinks, and serving windows. Overlays on the screen include recipe cards at the top, a score in the bottom left corner, and a countdown timer in the bottom right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
