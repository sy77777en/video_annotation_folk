    "pre_caption": "This is a static, over-the-shoulder shot. A rat is positioned in the left foreground with its back to the camera, occupying the lower-left portion of the frame. In the center-right middle ground, a television sits on a hutch, displaying a close-up of a man. To the left of the television, also in the middle ground, is a small fan. On a counter in the right middle ground, a bowl of fruit and a rolling pin are visible. A window can be seen in the background. The camera is positioned at the rat's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an over-the-shoulder shot, a gray rat with large pink ears is seen from behind in the foreground, looking towards a television. The rat is slightly out of focus. On the screen of an old-fashioned, black-and-white television positioned in the background, a large, fair-skinned man in a white chef's uniform and a tall chef's hat is shown in a close-up, appearing to speak with an animated expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead. The setting is a dimly lit, rustic kitchen during the day. In the center of the room, a vintage, boxy television with antennas rests on a dark wooden hutch, its black-and-white screen displaying a man in a chef's uniform. A small, black fan stands next to the television. To the right, on a wooden counter, a light-colored bowl contains green and red fruit beside a rolling pin. In the background, a window is covered by a sheer curtain, and the overall lighting is low, with the primary light source coming from the television screen.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a third-person over-the-shoulder view of a mouse watching a person speaking on the TV. The mouse is on the left side of the frame, slightly blurred, with its upper back visible. On the right side of the background, the TV shows a close-up of a person in a chef's uniform speaking.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
