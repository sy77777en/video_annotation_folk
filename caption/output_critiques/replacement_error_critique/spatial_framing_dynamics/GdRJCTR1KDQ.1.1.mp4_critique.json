    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of an old electronic device, initially positioned upright and centered in the middle ground on a concrete surface that occupies the bottom of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. A red garage door forms the background, visible in the upper portion of the frame. A white cable extends from the top rear of the device, its blue connector initially out of frame at the top. The device then begins to tilt backward, causing the blue cable connector to swing down from the top center into the central area of the frame. Subsequently, the device collapses further onto the concrete; its top portion moves slightly towards the background while its already broken base remains in the bottom-center of the middle ground, exposing more internal components. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An old, off-white electronic device is shown sitting upright on a concrete surface. The device has a bulky, rectangular shape with the upper portion of the back being rectangular and the lower part near the ground curved, resembling a semicircle. The front and top surfaces feature linear ventilation grilles. A single white cable with a blue connector extends from the top rear of the device. The bottom portion of the device's plastic casing is severely damaged and broken, with shattered pieces of plastic scattered around its base, exposing some of its internal components.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows the back of an old, beige electronic device that appears to have fallen onto a concrete surface outdoors. The device's casing is cracked and shattered at the bottom, exposing internal components and broken glass. A white cable with a blue connector swings. In the background, a red, weathered garage door with peeling paint is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
