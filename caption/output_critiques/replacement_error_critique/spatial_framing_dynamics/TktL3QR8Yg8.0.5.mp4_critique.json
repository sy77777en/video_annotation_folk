    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot featuring a young boy positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He kneels on a circular rug, also in the center middle ground, with a teddy bear and a miniature Ferris wheel directly in front of him. In the background, a large window is visible to the left of center. The scene has considerable depth, with various out-of-focus toys scattered in the foreground, such as a toy soldier on the bottom left and a red car on the bottom right. Other toys, like a toy carousel, are in the middle ground to the left of the boy. The camera is positioned at the boy's level, and the shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with short, dark hair and light skin is kneeling on a dark, patterned rug, his back to the viewer. He is wearing light-colored, striped pajamas and is barefoot. In front of him sits a small, brown teddy bear, also facing away from the viewer. Both the boy and the teddy bear are looking towards a miniature, metallic Ferris wheel. Several other small toys, including a toy carousel, a red toy car, a toy soldier, and a toy horse with a rider, are scattered on the rug and the wooden floor around them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, dimly lit room at night, featuring dark wooden floors. A prominent multi-paned window looks out onto a city with tall buildings, where pink and purple lights glow through what appears to be rain-streaked glass. In the center of the room, a child in striped pajamas kneels on a circular green rug. On the rug are a small brown teddy bear, a miniature silver-colored Ferris wheel, and some papers. The surrounding floor is sparsely scattered with other toys, including a red toy car, a miniature carousel, and a toy soldier. The room is primarily illuminated by warm light from within, while the cool light from the window also plays a significant role in creating a dark and shadowed interior.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
