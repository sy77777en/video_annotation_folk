    "pre_caption": "The video features two framed scenes, each containing full shots of people, moving horizontally across a black background. Initially, the first framed scene slides in from the right, coming to rest on the left side of the screen. Within this first frame, a man stands in the center middle ground, behind a large wooden desk in the foreground. To his right is an office chair in the middle ground, and further right, a window with a seal is visible in the background. A door is seen to his left in the background. Subsequently, a second framed scene slides in from the right, pushing the first frame further to the left, and settles on the right side of the screen. In this second frame, a man and a woman are seen from the back in the center middle ground, walking away down an aisle that extends from foreground to background. Beige upholstered seats line the right side of the aisle in the middle ground, with aircraft windows visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays two framed scenes. In one scene, a man with light skin and short, light-colored hair stands behind a polished wooden desk. He wears a white, long-sleeved collared shirt, a plain red tie, and dark trousers, with his hands placed on his hips. To his right, a light brown leather office chair is visible, with a dark coat draped over it. Further right, a window features the presidential seal. In the other scene, a man and a woman are seen from the back, walking down an aisle. The man, on the left, wears a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt and dark trousers, with his right arm around the woman's shoulders. The woman, on the right, wears a dark, long-sleeved top or jacket. They walk past beige upholstered seats lining the right side of the aisle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video displays two distinct scenes, each presented within a dark, box-like frame against a black background. Both scenes are set inside an aircraft, featuring light-colored walls, carpeted floors, and characteristic oval windows. The first framed scene reveals an office space where a man in a white shirt and red tie stands behind a substantial, polished dark wood desk, accompanied by a light brown leather office chair with a black coat draped over it; a circular seal is visible on a nearby window. The second framed scene shows a man and a woman walking away down a carpeted aisle of the aircraft, with a long, light-colored sofa lining one side.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features two frames moving horizontally and appearing fully on the screen one after another, each containing full shots of people in the airplane.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The lack of background information makes it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
