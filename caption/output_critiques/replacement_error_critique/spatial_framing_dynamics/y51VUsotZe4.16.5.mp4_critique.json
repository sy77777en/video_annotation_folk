    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a low-angle, forward-moving perspective, consistent with a dashcam view. The wet street occupies the bottom half of the frame, stretching from the immediate foreground into the background at the center. Initially, a red vehicle is positioned in the left foreground. As the camera moves forward, this vehicle exits the frame to the left. Buildings adorned with neon signs dominate the right side of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. A white van moves from the left middle ground toward the foreground, while other cars are visible parked in the right middle ground and driving in the distant background. The continuous forward motion causes the perspective to shift, with elements on the right side of the street moving from the middle ground toward the foreground before passing out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a vibrant urban environment at night, characterized by glowing neon signs and reflections on wet streets. The focus is on the atmosphere created by the interplay of artificial lights and the reflective surfaces, rather than any specific object. The scene conveys a sense of bustling nightlife and urban energy, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the city rather than highlighting a particular subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a dashcam mounted on a vehicle, presents an urban street scene at night. The setting is outdoors, featuring a bustling city environment illuminated by vibrant neon lights in various colors, predominantly cyan, reds, greens, and some yellow. These lights reflect off the wet pavement, suggesting recent rain. The road is lined with buildings adorned with glowing signs, and street lights are also visible, creating a lively and colorful atmosphere. The street is active, with vehicles and pedestrians visible, contributing to the dynamic cityscape. The overall scene conveys a sense of motion as the vehicle moves through the illuminated urban landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The wet street fills the lower half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. Initially, a red vehicle is visible in the left foreground but soon exits the frame as the camera moves backward. Neon-lit buildings line the right side, stretching from the middle ground into the background. A white van travels from the left middle ground toward the foreground, while other cars are parked in the right middle ground and drive in the distant background. The backward motion of the vehicle causes elements on the right side of the street to shift from the middle ground to the foreground before disappearing from view.",
