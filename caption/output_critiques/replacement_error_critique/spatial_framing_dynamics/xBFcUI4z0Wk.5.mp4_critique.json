    "pre_caption": "This high-angle full shot initially frames a damaged race car in the center-right middle ground, positioned on a paved track apron next to a grass infield. A safety truck is located in the top-left middle ground, while a catch fence is visible in the bottom-left foreground. Throughout the clip, several safety crew members emerge from the truck and walk to the driver's side of the race car. Simultaneously, the camera slowly zooms out, transitioning the scene into a wide shot and revealing more of the surrounding racetrack.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white and black Ford stock car, featuring a large red number \"98\" on its side and roof, is stopped on the apron of a racetrack with its front end visibly damaged and crumpled. A white Ford F-150 pickup truck, identified as an \"AMR SAFETY TEAM\" vehicle with flashing lights on its roof, is parked nearby. Several men wearing blue and white uniforms and white helmets emerge from the truck and walk toward the race car, gathering around the driver's side window to attend to the situation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set at a racetrack at night. A damaged white and black number 98 Ford stock car is stationary, positioned partially on the paved track apron and partially on the adjacent green grass infield. The car's front end is crumpled, and a wisp of steam rises from the hood. Next to the race car, a white safety truck is parked on the pavement with its headlights and roof lights on. In the foreground, a portion of a silver catch fence is visible. Several safety crew members in blue uniforms and white helmets exit the truck and approach the driver's side of the damaged vehicle.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
