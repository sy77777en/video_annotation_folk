    "pre_caption": "From a locked-on perspective, the back and arms of a person in a yellow wingsuit occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, slightly left of center, a second person in a turquoise wingsuit flies ahead. This second person's parachute deploys, unfurling from a bundle into a canopy that moves toward the center of the frame. The scene is set within a deep valley, with large, rocky mountains in the middle ground on the left and right. Far below in the background, a town and green fields are visible in the bottom left quadrant. The camera, mounted on the primary subject's back and looking forward, moves with them through the air, creating a dynamic where the background scenery rushes past the fixed foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows an individual in a yellow and black wingsuit with a hint of blue, captured by a camera that follows their movement. The person is the sole focus of the frame. As the video progresses, a parachute deploys, appearing as a crumpled bundle of white and light blue fabric that begins to unfurl in the center of the view under the tension of the lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object, captures a thrilling flight through a wide, green valley flanked by steep, rocky mountains under a clear blue sky. The central figure in this breathtaking scene is a person in a yellow and black wingsuit, whose arms are visible in the foreground. Below, a small town with red-roofed buildings and green fields is visible, bisected by a road. Another person in a turquoise and white wingsuit flies nearby, slightly ahead and to the left, before their parachute deploys. The sun is bright, casting a large shadow from one of the mountains across the valley.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is locked onto the back of a man flying in midair, with his back positioned at the very bottom of the frame. As the video progresses, he opens a parachute, which appears at the frame’s center just as it begins to unfold. In the background, distant mountains and a countryside town stretch across the landscape, creating a vast and scenic backdrop.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
