    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of three individuals around a table. The older man is centered in the frame, positioned in the middle ground, while the two women stand on either side of him, also in the middle ground. The woman in the teal jumpsuit is on the left side of the frame, and the woman in the pink sweater is on the right. The table, covered with a light blue cloth, occupies the foreground, with a rotating tray holding various bottles and jars placed centrally on it. The floral-patterned wallpaper and framed pictures adorn the background, along with a lamp on the left side of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout, capturing the scene without any noticeable changes in shot size or position. The spatial arrangement keeps the subjects evenly distributed across the frame, maintaining a balanced composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three people around a table with various bottles and jars on a rotating tray. In the center is an older man with short gray hair and glasses, wearing a yellow shirt and a beige vest. To his left stands a woman with medium-length dark hair and bangs, dressed in a teal jumpsuit over a blue shirt, with her hands in her pockets. On his right is another woman with long dark hair, wearing a pink sweater. The table is covered with a light blue tablecloth, and the bottles and jars are arranged on a black tray. The setting appears to be a dining room with patterned wallpaper and framed pictures on the wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a cozy dining room with a vintage aesthetic. The room features floral-patterned wallpaper and framed artwork on the walls. A round table with a light turquoise tablecloth is centrally placed, holding a rotating tray with various condiment bottles, including soy sauce and vinegar, characterized by their distinct labels and colors. An elderly man spins the tray, causing the bottles to rotate smoothly. The lighting is warm, emanating from a lamp with a soft glow, creating a comfortable ambiance. The setting suggests a casual, intimate gathering, with three individuals seated around the table, contributing to the homely atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
