    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a person in the foreground, positioned in the driver's seat of a car at their eye level. In the background, out-of-focus lights are visible through the car windows. As the shot progresses, the background lights streak horizontally, indicating motion, while the camera slowly moves closer to the person's face, causing them to fill more of the frame as the background becomes increasingly blurred.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned person with light-colored eyes and light brown hair sits in the driver's seat of a car at night. They have a faint, thin mustache and are looking directly forward with a neutral expression. Their hair appears to be pulled back or is short. They are positioned in the center of the view, and the scene is dimly lit from within the car.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a moving car at night. The vehicle's interior is dark, with the warm, brownish tones of a headrest visible. Through the car windows, the background is a blur of motion, with out-of-focus streetlights and other light sources streaking past, creating bright, circular patterns against the darkness. A person is seated in the driver's position, looking forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
