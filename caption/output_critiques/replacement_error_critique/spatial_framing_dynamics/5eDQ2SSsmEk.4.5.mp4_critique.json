    "pre_caption": "The video is a close-up shot focusing on a hand and a screwdriver. Initially, the screwdriver is blurred and occupies the center-right portion of the frame, while the platform is partially clear in the bottom section. As the hand enters the frame from the left, it holds the screwdriver in the foreground, with the hand positioned in the left-center of the frame. The hand then places a small metallic nail in the lower-left corner of the frame, on the platform which is in the foreground. The nail stands upright after being placed. The hand subsequently exits the frame from the left side, leaving the nail in the lower-left corner. The focus shifts from the screwdriver to the nail, highlighting the action. The background remains blurred throughout, indicating a spacious area with indistinct structures. The camera maintains a level position relative to the hand and the platform.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a hand holding a screwdriver, which is initially blurred, and a platform that is partially clear. The hand, with a light skin tone, becomes visible as it grips the screwdriver, a tool with a metallic shaft and a dark handle. The hand places a small, metallic nail on the platform, which has a rough, textured surface. The nail is positioned in the lower-left corner of the frame. After placing the nail, the hand moves out of the frame, leaving the nail standing upright on the platform. The focus shifts from the blurred screwdriver to the clear view of the nail, emphasizing the action of placing it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere. The environment features a rough, dusty surface in the foreground, possibly a workbench or floor, with a metallic screw prominently placed on it by a hand. The background is blurred, suggesting a spacious area with indistinct structures, possibly machinery or tools, contributing to the industrial feel. The lighting is low, casting shadows and creating a moody ambiance. The overall color palette is muted, with shades of gray and brown dominating the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a hand holding a screwdriver and placing a nail on a platform. Initially, only the screwdriver is blurred in the frame, with part of the platform clear. The hand then becomes visible in a close-up, holding the screwdriver. After placing the nail in the lower-left corner of the frame, the hand moves out of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
