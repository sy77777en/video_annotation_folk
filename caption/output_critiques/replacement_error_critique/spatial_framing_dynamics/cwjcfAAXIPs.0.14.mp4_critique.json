    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on an urban streetscape. Initially, a low stone wall with a frosted glass barrier occupies the foreground, extending from the bottom to the left of the frame. In the middle ground to the right, a building with a green, graffiti-covered facade is visible, with a clear blue sky in the background at the top. The camera, positioned at a low height, pans to the right. This movement shifts the stone wall and glass barrier to the left side of the frame, bringing the green facade to the center. An adjacent building with a large, curtained window becomes prominent in the middle ground on the right, while a cobblestone sidewalk appears in the bottom right foreground. By the end of the pan, the sky is visible in the upper left background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the urban environment and atmosphere rather than a specific main subject. It presents a street-level view featuring a modern transparent glass barrier that appears blurred atop a dark stone wall, juxtaposed with older, weathered building facades. One building has a pale green, graffiti-covered door adorned with posters, while the adjacent one features a large window covered by light curtains and displaying small signs. The emphasis is on the overall scene, textures, and architectural contrast, characteristic of a scenery shot where the environment itself is the focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures an outdoor urban scene during the day. The video pans slightly right along a sidewalk paved with small square tiles. In the immediate foreground is a low, straight wall made of dark grey stone blocks, surmounted by a transparent glass barrier with a frosted appearance due to water vapor. To the right of this structure are buildings lining the sidewalk. One building presents a light green, boarded-up facade adorned with various posters and blue and pink graffiti. Adjacent to it is another building entrance featuring a large glass window and door, partially covered by light-colored curtains from the inside, with small signs visible on the window pane. A dark drainpipe runs vertically down the building wall between these two sections. The sky is initially visible at the top of the frame and shifts to the upper left by the end of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
