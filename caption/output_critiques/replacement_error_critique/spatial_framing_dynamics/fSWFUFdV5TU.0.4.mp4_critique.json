    "pre_caption": "This medium shot frames an older woman positioned in the left-center of the middle ground, reclining on a couch. A strong beam of light enters from the top right, illuminating her right side and a shelf in the right background. A second person briefly enters the left foreground, partially obscuring the woman, before moving out of the frame to the left. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older woman with long, light-colored hair is shown in a dimly lit room, reclining on a couch. She wears a light-colored, short-sleeved top and has a somber expression as she looks off-camera to her left. A subtle light source from the right gently illuminates the side of her face and the front of her body, while the rest of the scene is cast in deep shadow. Her left arm rests on the armrest of the couch, and her right arm is positioned next to her body. A thin wisp of smoke is visible drifting through the beam of light. Another individual briefly enters the frame from the right and exits to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit room, largely cast in shadow. A single, subtle light source from the right highlights an older woman seated on a couch positioned in the middle ground. The couch is draped with a patterned, lace-like cover, and in the background, a shelf holds a few indistinct objects. The color palette is muted and cool, contrasting with the warm glow of the light. A thin wisp of smoke drifts slowly upwards on the right side of the scene, adding a subtle element of motion to the otherwise still environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
