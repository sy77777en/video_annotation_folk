    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a dark shipwreck, positioned centrally in the middle ground and angled slightly from the top left towards the bottom right, resting on the seabed in the background. A small, beige \"1901\" overlay is fixed in the bottom left foreground. The camera, initially positioned above the shipwreck, then tilts and moves upwards, causing the shipwreck to recede into the background and eventually disappear from view. The scene transitions to a full shot of a silhouetted diver, who appears in the center middle ground, suspended in the blue water, with the camera now positioned below them. A thin tether line extends upwards from the diver towards the top of the frame, also in the middle ground, while the \"1901\" overlay remains in the bottom left foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially shows a dark, blocky shipwreck resting on the seabed in murky blue water, with some metallic and possibly rusted sections visible. The view then transitions upwards, away from the shipwreck, to reveal a diver. The diver, silhouetted against the lighter blue water, is wearing a full-body wetsuit, a helmet, and shoes, and is tethered by a thin line extending upwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video opens on a dark shipwreck lying on its side at the bottom of the sea, surrounded by deep blue water with some particulate matter visible. The scene then transitions to a wider view of the blue water, where a diver in a dark, full-body suit is seen stationary, attached to a thin line extending upwards. A small, beige rectangular overlay with the number \"1901\" is present in the bottom left corner throughout the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and below the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
