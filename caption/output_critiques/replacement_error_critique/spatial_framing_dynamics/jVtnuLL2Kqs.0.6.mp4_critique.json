    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot. The foreground is defined by a stone embankment running along the bottom of the frame, with an ornate black lamppost positioned in the foreground on the right. The River Thames occupies the middle ground, stretching across the lower half of the scene. Spanning the river in the center of the middle ground is the Tower Bridge. In the background, the Tower of London is visible on the far riverbank to the left. A string of lights extends from the top right of the frame towards the center, and a white watermark is located in the bottom right corner. The camera is positioned at eye level on the embankment, providing a straight-on perspective of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot of London on a clear day. The view is from a stone embankment along the River Thames, looking towards the iconic Tower Bridge, whose two grand towers and blue suspension cables dominate the center of the frame. To the left, the historic Tower of London is visible on the far bank. The composition lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of this famous urban landscape, focusing on the relationship between the architectural landmarks and the river rather than any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is an outdoor, daytime scene in London, viewed from a stone embankment along the River Thames. In the center, the iconic Tower Bridge spans the murky brown river, its two stone towers and blue suspension cables prominent against a clear blue sky. To the left, the historic Tower of London is visible on the riverbank. The foreground consists of the beige stone walkway, with a series of black, ornate lampposts placed at intervals along the embankment and a string of lights stretching across the top of the view. A white watermark is overlaid in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
