    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a wide shot of an ornate room, with a large, dark-framed window dominating the center of the frame. Through the window, a park with snow and bare trees is visible in the middle ground under a cloudy sky in the background. A woman then enters from the right foreground, and the shot transitions to a medium shot as she walks toward the window. She stops in the center foreground, with her back to the camera, which is positioned at her level. As she settles into this position, a large, metallic sculpture is revealed through the window, situated in the middle ground, slightly left of center. The room's marble walls and an ornate light fixture remain in the foreground on the left and top right, respectively, framing the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with blonde, shoulder-length hair, wearing a tan coat with her hands in the pockets and carrying a dark purse over her shoulder, walks from the right side of the scene toward a large window. As she approaches the window and stops with her back to the viewer, a large, metallic, bean-shaped sculpture becomes visible in the park outside. The sculpture is situated among bare trees under a cloudy, twilight sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From inside a dimly lit, ornate room with marble-paneled walls and a patterned carpet, a large window looks out onto Chicago's Millennium Park at dusk. The ground below is covered in snow, and leafless trees line a street with sparse traffic. In the distance, the reflective, curved form of the Cloud Gate sculpture is visible against a sky with soft clouds. A woman in a tan coat approaches the window and stands looking out at the wintery cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
