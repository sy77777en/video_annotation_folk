    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a surfer is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on a surfboard that extends from the bottom of the frame into the foreground. The wave and its white spray are in the middle ground, flanking the surfer on the left and right. In the background, a shoreline is visible on the right side of the frame, with the sunset sky occupying the upper portion. The camera, positioned at the subject's level on the front of the board, remains fixed, causing the background shoreline to move from right to left as the surfer rides the wave.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, curly, medium-length hair and a full beard is shown surfing. He is wearing a long-sleeved, black wetsuit and is barefoot. He stands on a blue surfboard with his knees bent and his arms extended to his sides for balance as he rides a wave. His body is angled, and he is looking forward in the direction he is moving.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted to a surfboard captures a person surfing on a wave in the ocean. The scene takes place at sunset, with a warm orange glow on the horizon fading into a pale blue sky. The blue, textured surface of the surfboard cuts through the water, creating white sea spray. In the distance, a sandy shoreline with trees and buildings is visible. The surfer, wearing a full-body black wetsuit, stands barefoot on the board, balanced on the moving wave.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
