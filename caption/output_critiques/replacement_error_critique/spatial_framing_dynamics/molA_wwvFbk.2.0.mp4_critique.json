    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a collapsing cityscape, captured from a low angle looking up. Initially, a large section of a building's facade, positioned in the top-left and center of the frame, tilts downwards and towards the right. As this middle-ground structure crumbles, it reveals the building's exposed interior across the center of the frame. A large plume of dust and debris simultaneously erupts from the right and bottom, filling the foreground and middle ground. A small figure is briefly visible in the center of the frame, walking horizontally from right to left along an exposed floor in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This black-and-white cityscape destruction scene captures the catastrophic collapse of ornate, multi-story buildings, with entire facades tilting and breaking apart, sending clouds of dust and rubble cascading downwards in a chaotic spectacle. Amidst the overwhelming event, a small, dark-clad figure briefly appears walking across a partially destroyed floor, introducing a poignant human element that emphasizes the immense scale of the architectural destruction. The camera focuses on the environmental chaos, highlighting both the dramatic spectacle and the solitary figure within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic scene, an ornate, multi-story building undergoes a catastrophic collapse. The structure, characterized by its detailed facade and arched windows, tilts and breaks apart, creating a large cloud of dust and debris. As the exterior walls crumble away, the building's internal framework is exposed, revealing its separate floors and rooms. A small figure is briefly visible walking on a narrow ledge within the disintegrating structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
