    "pre_caption": "The video primarily shows a wide shot of an indoor room, filmed from a third-person over-the-shoulder POV. In the foreground, a blurry person is positioned on the left side of the frame, with only part of their chest-up body visible. They are holding a dark-colored smartphone in their extended hand, which is in the foreground, slightly to the right of their body, using its flashlight to illuminate the area ahead. The light from the phone projects towards the center of the frame, lighting up a dark indoor hallway that occupies the middle ground and extends into the background. Directly ahead, at the end of the hallway in the background and center, a closed white door with a small vent near its top is visible. To the right of the character, in the middle ground and on the right side of the frame, an open door is seen. Further to the right, also in the middle ground, another door is partially open. A light-colored, wall-mounted rectangular panel is positioned in the middle ground on the right wall. Adjacent to this panel, in the middle ground and to its right, a white piece of furniture supports a woven basket. Green foliage is visible in the middle ground, top right, above the panel. In the top right corner, also in the middle ground, a screen reflects the light from the smartphone. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, filmed from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, shows a blurry person in the foreground on the left side of the frame. Only the chest-up portion of this individual is visible. They appear to have light-colored hair, seen from the back and side, and are wearing a light-colored top. The person is holding a dark-colored smartphone in their extended hand, using its flashlight to illuminate a dark indoor hallway ahead.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, from an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character showing their chest-above body and the scene ahead, depicts a dimly lit indoor residential hallway, likely at night. The character holds a dark, rectangular smartphone, its screen casting a cool, faint light forward, illuminating the narrow passage with light-colored walls. Directly ahead, at the end of the hallway, a closed white door with a small vent near its top is visible. To the right of the character, two doors are open; the left door is fully open, while the right door is partially open. Further along the right wall, a light-colored, wall-mounted rectangular panel, possibly an electrical box, is present. Adjacent to this panel, a white piece of furniture supports a woven basket, and some green foliage is visible above the panel. Above the woven basket in the upper right corner, a screen reflects the light from the smartphone. The overall scene is dark, with the phone serving as the primary light source.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video primarily shows a wide shot of an indoor room, filmed from a third-person over-the-shoulder POV. In the foreground, a blurry person is positioned on the left side of the frame, with only part of their chest-up body visible. They are using their phone's flashlight to illuminate the area ahead.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
