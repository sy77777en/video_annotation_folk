    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle full shot, a white airplane is stationary in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground.

The camera remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A computer-generated animation displays a large, white, twin-engine passenger airplane model from a high-angle view. The aircraft is situated on a gray paved surface resembling an airport runway or taxiway, which is marked with yellow lines and surrounded by green, grass-like terrain. A black banner at the bottom of the screen features yellow text that reads \"JFK TWR:\" followed by white text that says \"American 106 Heavy, American 106 Heavy hold position.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, objective viewpoint, a white, unmarked passenger airplane is moving forward on a wide, gray, textured runway at an airport. The runway intersects with a gray taxiway marked by a single yellow line. The paved surfaces are surrounded by flat, green grass. A black overlay bar at the bottom of the screen displays yellow text, which reads \"JFK TWR:\" followed by the instruction \"American 106 Heavy, American 106 Heavy hold position\" in white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
