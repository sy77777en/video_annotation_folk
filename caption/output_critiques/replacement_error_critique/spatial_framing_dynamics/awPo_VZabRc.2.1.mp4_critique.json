    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot where an animated character is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center, in an acrobatic pose over the trunk of a green car. The car is in the bottom center, angled away from the camera, while a storefront occupies the left side of the frame. The scene then cuts to an extreme wide shot from a different angle, placing the character on the sidewalk in the middle ground, near the center of the frame, with a silver car now visible in the bottom right. The character then runs from this central position along the sidewalk, moving toward the left and into the background until he disappears behind the corner of the building. The camera remains static at a neutral height in both shots.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a flat, animated male character with a tall, slender build, dressed in a dark suit and gray pants, with black hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated scene depicts an urban street corner at either dawn or dusk, under a sky with soft orange and pink tones. The setting is defined by multi-story, rectangular buildings with a muted, grayish-purple color scheme, one of which features an external fire escape. A prominent corner storefront has large display windows and a sign with the word \"pets\" in white and \"n shit\" in black, next to a cartoon logo of a dog and cat. On the paved street, a light green, vintage-style sedan is parked, while a silver, modern sports coupe is stopped near a crosswalk. Additional details include a white fire hydrant on the sidewalk and power lines stretching across the sky, with the silhouettes of taller city buildings visible in the distance. A figure in a black coat moves acrobatically over the green car and then runs along the sidewalk.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
