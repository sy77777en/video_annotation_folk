    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a low-angle medium close-up of a helicopter, which occupies the center of the frame from the middle ground to the foreground. A large, circular engine intake is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, while the cockpit is in the upper center. As the helicopter descends, a spotlight on its top right activates, and the camera tracks its movement, shifting from a low angle to a level perspective. Once the helicopter has landed in the center of the frame, a person disembarks from its right side, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-colored, military-style helicopter, featuring a prominent front windshield, is shown landing in a dimly lit setting. A large circular duct is located in the background on the left side of the frame. A bright spotlight, mounted on the helicopter's right side near the cockpit, illuminates the scene. Inside the cockpit, a helmeted pilot is partially visible. As the helicopter settles, a person in dark attire, possibly tactical gear, disembarks from its side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from an objective viewpoint, shows a dark-colored helicopter in a dense, shadowy forest at night. Initially, the helicopter is dimly visible against the dark trees and uneven ground. A large, circular structure is noticeable in the background on the left side of the frame, unrelated to the helicopter. A bright spotlight on the helicopter then activates, casting a strong beam of light forward, illuminating the immediate area and revealing some atmospheric haze, while small green and red lights glow from within the cockpit. An overlay of the text \"Kyle: Yes, sir.\" appears at the bottom of the screen.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a helicopter landing. The camera is positioned to the right front of the helicopter, capturing the lower part of the propeller. Initially, the shot is from a low angle, looking up at the bottom of the helicopter. As the helicopter lands, the camera tracks its movement, transitioning to a level angle. The shot shows the head of the pilot inside the helicopter and, eventually, the full body of the person exiting the helicopter.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
