    "pre_caption": "The video initially presents no distinct subject, with a tree trunk in sharp focus occupying the foreground on the left. A blurred man is visible in the background, positioned towards the center-right. The shot transitions as the man leans slightly to his left, emerging more clearly from behind the right edge of the foreground tree, and comes into focus, shifting the shot to a close-up of him. He is then positioned in the middle ground, to the right of the center, with the foreground tree trunk remaining on the left. Other trees and foliage form the background. When the man is revealed, the camera is at his level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a man in a forest setting. Initially, the camera is focused on the tree trunk in the foreground, causing the background to appear blurred, with only a partial view of the man's face visible. As the video progresses, the man becomes fully visible, leaning slightly to the side of the tree. He has a receding hairline with his long hair pulled back into a ponytail and is wearing a dark jacket over a white shirt. His expression is serious and focused, and he is facing forward, looking intently in the direction of the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dim, outdoor forest environment, likely during dusk or in a heavily shaded area. In the foreground, the rough, dark brown bark of a tree trunk is in sharp focus. The background is initially blurred but gradually comes into focus, revealing more trees and foliage in muted green and gray tones. A person, wearing a dark jacket over a white shirt, is visible in the middle ground, partially obscured by the trees, and moves slightly to become clearer.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
