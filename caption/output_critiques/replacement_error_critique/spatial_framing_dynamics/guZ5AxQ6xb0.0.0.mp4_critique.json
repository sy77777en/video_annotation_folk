    "pre_caption": "A full shot, filmed at the subject's level, shows a helicopter stationary in the center of the frame. The helicopter is situated in the middle ground, resting on a snow-covered surface that extends into the foreground. Falling snow is visible throughout the frame, from the foreground to the background, creating a layered effect. The background is an indistinct white expanse. The camera remains static, and the entire scene is out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A helicopter is shown from a frontal perspective, its form blurred and partially obscured by falling snow. The aircraft has a dark-colored fuselage with hints of yellow and red markings. Its two long, black main rotor blades are extended horizontally, and a smaller tail rotor is visible in the background. The helicopter is resting on skids that are partially buried in a deep layer of white snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A helicopter is stationary on the ground in a vast, snow-covered expanse during a heavy snowfall. The entire scene is out of focus, rendering the dark-colored helicopter as a soft silhouette against the white, indistinct background. Snowflakes fall continuously, further obscuring the view of the aircraft and its motionless rotor blades.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
