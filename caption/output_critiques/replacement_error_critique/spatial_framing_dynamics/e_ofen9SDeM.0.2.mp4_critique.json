    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the top of a man's head visible in the center of the frame, emerging from behind tall grass in the foreground. As he walks forward up a hill, the shot size transitions from a close-up to a medium shot, revealing his torso and the two sacks he carries. He remains centered, moving from the middle ground toward the camera. The camera then tilts down, reframing the shot to focus on his lower body. In this final composition, his legs are centered, and the two sacks he holds are positioned on the left and right sides of the frame as he continues to walk forward. The background is a soft-focus green hill. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An elderly man with long, wispy white hair and a full white beard is shown walking up a grassy hill. He is dressed in a blue long-sleeved shirt, brown trousers, and suspenders. Initially, only his head and shoulders are visible, but as he moves forward, his full torso is revealed. He is already holding two large, beige cloth sacks, one in each hand, which become visible as he ascends further up the hill. The focus then shifts to his lower body, showing his legs and the two sacks he carries.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a vast, windswept field of tall green grass, an elderly man with a long white beard and hair emerges from over a small rise. Dressed in a blue shirt, suspenders, and brown trousers, he holds two light-colored burlap sacks as he continues to climb the hill. The background is a soft-focus, rolling green hill under a muted, overcast sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with just the top of the man's head in frame. As he climbs the hill and moves closer to the camera, more of his body is revealed, transitioning to a medium shot. Eventually, as he continues walking toward the camera, only his legs are visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
