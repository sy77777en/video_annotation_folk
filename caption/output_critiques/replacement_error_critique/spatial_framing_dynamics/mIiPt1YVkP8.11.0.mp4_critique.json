    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of an airport from a high-angle perspective. The focus is on the scenery, as there are no main subjects. In the foreground, a paved taxiway curves from the bottom of the frame toward the center. This taxiway merges into a long, straight runway that occupies the middle ground, stretching from the center of the frame into the distant background. The surrounding terrain is flat and green. In the background, the silhouettes of blocky buildings are visible across the horizon, with a bright sun positioned in the top right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a stylized scenery shot of a vast, empty airport at either sunrise or sunset. The camera looks down a long, straight runway that stretches into the hazy distance, while a curving taxiway with yellow centerlines merges into it from the foreground. The surrounding flat, green terrain is marked by a grid-like pattern of other taxiways and simple, blocky buildings that form a minimalist cityscape on the horizon under a thick, reddish-purple haze, with a bright, glowing sun hanging low in the sky. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the expansive scale of the airport and the atmospheric, almost surreal, quality of the light and fog, creating a sense of quiet desolation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene depicts an airport taxiway at either dawn or dusk under a hazy, reddish-purple sky. A bright, round sun sits low on the horizon, casting a soft glow. In the foreground, a dark gray paved taxiway with a solid yellow centerline curves and merges with a longer, straight runway that stretches into the distance. The paved surfaces are surrounded by flat, green, grassy terrain. In the distant background, the simple, blocky silhouettes of buildings are partially obscured by the atmospheric haze.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
