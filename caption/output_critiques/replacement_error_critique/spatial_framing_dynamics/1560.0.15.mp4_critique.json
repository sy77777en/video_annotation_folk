    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a subway station, captured from a high-angle, severely tilted perspective. Initially, the frame is oriented almost vertically, with the platform occupying the top and left, the track bed in the bottom left foreground, and a large, curved yellow-and-blue light fixture in the top right middle ground. The far end of the station, including a digital sign with a clock, is visible in the center background. The camera then executes a continuous counter-clockwise rotation. As it rotates, the digital sign moves from the background to dominate the left foreground. Simultaneously, the platform shifts to occupy the bottom right of the frame, while the track bed moves to the top right, and the wall with blue uplighting transitions to the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a dynamic architectural scenery shot capturing the interior of a modern, empty subway station. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the striking design, atmosphere, and scale of the urban environment. The disorienting, tilted camera perspective sweeps along a deserted platform, where dramatic blue uplighting casts long shadows against a wall, leading the eye towards a dark tunnel. A series of large, curved overhead structures features rounded, hooded lights in yellow, orange, and blue, projecting reflective colors onto the ground. A brightly lit digital sign displays the time as approximately 10:35, indicates \"Gleis 1\" (Track 1), and shows an \"SOS Nothalt\" (Emergency Stop) button, grounding the surreal scene with functional details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dynamic, tilted, and continuously rotating perspective captures a modern and spacious subway station. The scene features a long, light-colored platform bordered by a dark track bed. The tunnel walls are bathed in blue light, contrasting with a series of curved structures overhead, adorned with rounded, hooded lights in shades of yellow, orange, and blue. A prominent black digital display screen shows the time on an analog clock face and the track number \"Gleis 1,\" along with subway arrival information. The station appears clean and mostly empty, with its architectural features and lighting creating a distinct, contemporary atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
