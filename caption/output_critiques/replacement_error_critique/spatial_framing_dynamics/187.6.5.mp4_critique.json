    "pre_caption": "The video opens with out-of-focus elements in the immediate foreground moving towards the right, initially obscuring a woman positioned in the middle ground, who is partially visible in the left portion of the frame. As these foreground elements move out of view, the shot transitions to a close-up of the woman, now more clearly situated in the left half of the frame. She then turns her body to her left, into a profile view facing left, while simultaneously shifting her position towards the right side of the frame. Throughout this sequence, the background remains very dark and indistinct. When the woman is revealed, the camera is positioned at her level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with an adult holding a child in the foreground, whose presence initially obscures the main subject. As they move, a woman with dark skin walks into the frame. She initially faces the camera and then turns to her left, resulting in a profile view. She wears a vibrant headscarf, predominantly blue and yellow with map-like or illustrative patterns, tied around her head. Her attire includes a light-colored, possibly shimmery beige or gold, high-necked top, and a dark jacket with prominent, contrasting white cuffs. She raises her right hand to the side of her head, near her ear.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor environment, two out-of-focus figures walk across the foreground. A third figure is partially visible against a very dark, indistinct background, wearing a colorful headscarf patterned with blue, yellow, green, and white, along with a dark jacket over a light-colored turtleneck featuring white cuffs. The figure turns their entire body and moves to the right side of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
