    "pre_caption": "This wide, first-person POV shot is captured from a sidewalk in the left foreground, which features a stone lantern and extends into the middle ground. The asphalt road occupies the center of the frame, stretching from the immediate foreground into the background. Initially, a dark blue van is prominent in the right foreground, moving towards the center. A traditional corner building is visible in the right middle ground, with pedestrians nearby. As the video progresses, the dark blue van moves from the right foreground, across the center, and recedes into the left background. Concurrently, other vehicles, including a green bus starting in the left middle ground, a white kei van, and a small dark blue car, traverse the road primarily from right to left, occupying the middle ground before moving further into the background or exiting to the left. The buildings on both sides of the road and the distant hills remain static in the middle ground and background, framing the vehicular movement, while utility wires are visible overhead across the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of a bustling street corner in a Japanese town. The focus is on the dynamic movement of vehicles traveling back and forth on the road, pedestrians coming and going on the opposite sidewalk, and the distinct Japanese architectural style of the surrounding buildings. The camera's perspective and movement suggest an observational stance, aiming to convey the general ambiance and activity of the location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a sunlit street scene in a Japanese town. The asphalt road, marked with white lines and circular manhole covers, carries light traffic, including a dark blue van moving away from the viewer, a green bus, a white kei van, and a small dark blue car. To the left, a sidewalk paved with multi-toned rectangular tiles features a traditional stone lantern and a small pine tree in front of a gray and white traditional building. Further in the background, a modern building with large glass windows and a residential building are visible. On the opposite side of the asphalt road, behind the sidewalk, a two-story corner building exhibits traditional Japanese architecture with a tiled roof and signage in Japanese characters; two pedestrians, one with a red umbrella, stand nearby. Overhead, numerous utility wires crisscross the clear blue sky, with green hills visible in the distant background. A traffic light shows a green signal.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
