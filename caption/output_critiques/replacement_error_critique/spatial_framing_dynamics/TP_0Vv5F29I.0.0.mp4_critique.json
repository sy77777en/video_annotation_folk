    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, where a long train is centered, moving from the background toward the foreground along a single track that divides the frame vertically. Vast, plowed fields occupy the middle ground on both the left and right sides, while a line of trees and buildings sits on the horizon in the distant background. As the train approaches, the camera zooms in, transitioning the view to a medium shot. This brings the locomotive into the bottom left of the frame and the cyclist, positioned on a high platform on a cargo car, to the top left. The ramp course extends from the center of the frame towards the top right. The camera's perspective, initially high above the train, lowers to a position slightly above the cyclist's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A long freight train with a dark blue locomotive travels along a single track. The front of the locomotive is adorned with a prominent \"Red Bull\" logo, and its side displays the text \"GRUPA AZOTY\" and \"KOLTAR.\" The train's cargo consists of blue shipping containers and flatbed cars, which have been modified to form a continuous course of white ramps and platforms. At the beginning of this course, a man wearing a helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and red pants sits on a black mountain bike. He is positioned atop a tall blue structure on the first cargo car, just behind the locomotive. On-screen text identifies him as \"DAWID MTB ATHLETE.\" Several of the blue containers along the train also feature the \"Red Bull\" logo.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a long freight train moving along a single, straight track that cuts through a vast, flat landscape of plowed brown fields. The scene takes place during the day under a clear blue sky. The black locomotive at the front features a Red Bull logo and pulls a series of flatbed cars carrying a custom-built course. This course is constructed from dark blue shipping containers, all displaying Red Bull logos, and a series of connected white and blue ramps. A person on a bicycle is visible at the start of the course, positioned on a high platform above a container. In the distance, a faint line of trees, buildings, and low hills marks the horizon. White text overlays appear on screen, identifying the rider as \"DAWID MTB ATHLETE\" and stating the objective: \"I'm going to ride on a moving train attempting one single run from start to finish.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of a scenic landscape, showing a train approaching the camera. A person on a bicycle on the train, initially small in the frame, becomes bigger as the train gets closer, seemingly preparing for a stunt. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
