    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, an astronaut is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The astronaut is viewed from behind, floating motionlessly against a background composed of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines that create a vast, grid-like structure. Scattered points of light are visible within this background structure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An astronaut is seen from behind, floating in a weightless pose with their arms and legs slightly spread. They are wearing a full-body, dark gray spacesuit with a prominent, white, boxy life-support pack on their chest and back. The helmet's dark visor completely obscures the astronaut's face and identity. The figure is oriented directly away from the viewer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An astronaut in a dark spacesuit with a grey life support system floats centrally within a vast, dark, and abstract indoor environment. The setting is composed of an infinite, grid-like structure of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines with a brownish hue, resembling endless shelves or data streams. Scattered throughout this complex, multi-layered architecture are small, bright points of light. The astronaut is viewed from behind, suspended motionlessly in the middle of this luminous, geometric space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
