    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot, viewed from directly above, of a white, textured plate occupying the center foreground, resting on a marble-like surface visible in the background. On the plate, two slices of avocado toast are positioned. One slice, topped with red tomato slices, is in the top left of the plate. The second slice, initially just with mashed avocado, is in the bottom right of the plate. A light-skinned hand enters from the top right of the frame, moving into the foreground to place sliced brown mushrooms onto the avocado spread of the bottom right toast. The hand sequentially arranges the mushrooms in two columns, starting from the right edge of the toast and moving towards the left, with three mushrooms in each column. The camera remains static throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two slices of avocado toast on a white, textured plate. Both slices consist of brown bread topped with a layer of mashed green avocado. \nOne slice is covered with overlapping slices of red tomato. A light-skinned hand places sliced brown mushrooms one by one onto the avocado spread on the second slice of toast closest to the camera, arranging them in neat rows.\n\n**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors, showing a white plate with a textured pattern resting on a marble-like surface. On the plate are two slices of toast topped with mashed green avocado. One slice is further decorated with round, red tomato slices. Throughout the video, a hand carefully arranges sliced, brown mushrooms in rows on the second slice of avocado toast.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
