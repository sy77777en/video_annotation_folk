    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a red, bird-like creature positioned in the center-right of the frame. The creature is in the middle ground, flying horizontally from right to left just above an orange, melting landscape that stretches across the center of the frame. In the foreground, a purple ground with small yellow shapes occupies the bottom portion of the screen. The background consists of purple and blue trees and green bushes at the top. The camera, positioned at the creature's height, pans to the left, following its movement and keeping it centered as the composition becomes a wide shot revealing more of the expansive, surreal environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a stylized, animated bird with exaggerated features. The bird has a straight, narrow beak ending with a wider rectangular section, and its eyes are purple with black pupils, giving it a cartoonish appearance. Its body is primarily red with orange accents, including its wings and tail feathers. The bird is depicted flying to the left throughout the entire video, against a backdrop of orange and purple shapes that might symbolize foliage. The overall scene is vibrant and surreal, with bold colors and abstract forms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This animated scene takes place in a surreal, outdoor landscape with a psychedelic color palette. The ground is a flat, deep purple surface from which small, yellow, plant-like shapes protrude. Stretching across the midground is a lumpy, orange terrain that appears to be melting, with drips hanging down towards the purple ground. The background is a dark, dense forest of stylized trees in shades of purple and blue, with light blue forms at the very top that also have a dripping quality. Behind the purple trees, green bushes add another layer of depth. A red, bird-like creature with a single large purple eye and a long, striped beak flies from right to left across the scene, just above the orange landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.",
