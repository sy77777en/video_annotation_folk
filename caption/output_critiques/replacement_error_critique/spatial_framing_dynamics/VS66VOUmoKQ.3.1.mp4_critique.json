    "pre_caption": "An overhead close-up shot shows an open white box positioned in the center of the frame. A black smartwatch is in a recessed section on the left side of the box's grey insert. Initially, a hand in the right foreground holds an orange utility knife over the right side of the box. A second hand enters from the right, picks up a black-handled utility knife from the right of the box, and moves it left. The black knife is then placed on the box, to the left of the orange one, with its blade pointing toward the smartwatch. Throughout the shot, colorful sticks are visible in the top-left background, and a set of screwdrivers lies in the right background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man's light-skinned hand initially holds a utility knife with a bright orange, textured handle and a silver blade holder. He then places this knife on an open white box containing a black, rectangular smartwatch nestled in a grey molded insert. Next, he picks up a second utility knife with a black, honeycomb-patterned handle from the right side of the box and positions it on the box to the left of the orange-handled knife. The black-handled knife has its blade extended and bears the word \"Subscribe.\" To the right of the box is a collection of precision screwdrivers with metallic bodies and colored bands. In the upper left, a bundle of colorful plastic sticks is visible. The white surface around the box is lightly scattered with small, dark metal shavings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective reveals a scene on a white surface scattered with dark specks. In the center lies an open white box containing a grey molded insert. This insert features two recessed sections: one holds a black rectangular smartwatch, and the other is being hovered over by a hand holding an orange utility knife with a textured grip. A second utility knife with a black, honeycomb-patterned handle rests nearby. The surrounding area includes a cluster of colorful rods to the left and an assortment of screwdrivers and a multi-tool to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
