    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a medium shot of a man in the center foreground. The camera then zooms out, transitioning to a wider shot. In the final composition, the man is positioned in the left foreground, with his full body visible on an exercise bike. A woman, shown from the upper body up, stands in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, holding a microphone. Another man is visible in the middle ground, standing between the two main subjects but further back. The background is occupied by rows of empty stadium seats, with several banners hanging in the upper background. On-screen graphics are present, with \"LIVE\" in the top right corner and a news banner along the bottom of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with short brown hair, wearing a black baseball cap backward and a bright blue t-shirt, is shown sitting on an exercise bike. His face and neck are covered in sweat. A light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a black blazer, stands in front of him, holding a microphone with a \"PAUL HENRY\" logo toward him as she conducts an interview. In the middle ground, another light-skinned man with short dark hair, dressed in an outfit resembling a competition staff uniform, is actively taking notes with a pen during the interview.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a television broadcast-style viewpoint, the scene is set indoors at the Vector Arena in Auckland. The background features rows of empty, blue stadium seats under artificial lighting. Several banners are visible, including a white one for the \"Halberg Disability Sport Foundation,\" a blue one with \"Concept\" branding, and a yellow and white one for \"Dole.\" Multiple exercise bikes are positioned on the dark floor. The broadcast includes several text overlays: \"LIVE\" appears in the top right corner, while a banner at the bottom of the screen displays \"VECTOR ARENA, AUCKLAND\" and \"NEWS HEADLINES\" next to a \"PAUL\" logo.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene begins with a medium shot of a man. The camera then zooms out, revealing the full body of the man and the upper body of a woman standing in front of him, conducting an interview.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
