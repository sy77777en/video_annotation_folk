    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a lush, natural landscape dominated by a waterfall. The waterfall is centrally positioned in the middle ground, with its two streams falling into a small pool below. In the initial state, several people are visible near the base of the waterfall, located in the bottom center of the frame. As the video progresses, these individuals gradually move out of the frame, leaving the waterfall as the sole focal point. The dense greenery surrounds the waterfall, occupying the left, right, and upper portions of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. The rocky terrain is situated directly behind the waterfall, forming part of the middle ground. The camera maintains a high vantage point throughout, positioned above the waterfall and the surrounding area, offering a comprehensive view of the entire scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height; the framing remains consistent, capturing the expansive greenery and the central waterfall in full view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the lush greenery and the waterfall. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and scale of the landscape rather than a specific object, creating a sense of immersion in the natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, outdoor setting featuring a waterfall cascading into a small pool surrounded by dense greenery. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the vibrant green foliage and the rocky terrain. The waterfall, with its clear, flowing water, creates a dynamic element against the earthy tones of the rocks. The surrounding forest is dense with various trees and plants, adding texture and depth to the landscape. The area around the pool is dotted with rocks and patches of grass, providing a natural, serene environment. The drone's perspective offers a sweeping view of the scene, highlighting the waterfall's height and the expansive greenery enveloping the area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
