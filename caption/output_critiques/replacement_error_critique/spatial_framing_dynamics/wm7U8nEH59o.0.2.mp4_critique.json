    "pre_caption": "The video utilizes a full shot, captured from a low angle looking up at a person. This individual is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground as they stand on a metal fire escape. The fire escape structure itself spans from the foreground, across the middle ground where the person is located, and into the background, with the building facade also in the background. During the clip, the person raises a rifle-like device to their shoulder. The framing of the person remains consistent, keeping their full figure in view and relatively centered, while the intricate patterns of light and shadow cast by the fire escape and on the building shift slightly with the subject's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is positioned on a metal fire escape, their figure largely in shadow with some areas illuminated. This individual wears a red and white mask with clown-like features, including red hair-like elements. The clothing is dark and indistinct due to low lighting, making it difficult to determine the true color, but they appear to be wearing a shirt and pants. The person holds a device resembling a rifle in a two-handed grip, with the barrel pointed upwards and slightly to one side, and the stock near their shoulder. At the start of the video, the individual raises this rifle to their shoulder and then fires it, and a rope flies out, trailing from what appears to be a jagged metal point. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night, looking up at a dark metal fire escape attached to the side of a building. The fire escape features crisscrossing bars and stairs, creating a complex pattern of shadows and highlights against the dimly lit building facade. The building itself is dark, with some lighter horizontal architectural details visible. A figure is positioned on the fire escape. The overall atmosphere is shadowy and high-contrast.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
