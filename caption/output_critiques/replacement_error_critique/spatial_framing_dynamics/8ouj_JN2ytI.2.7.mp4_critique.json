    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a man positioned in the center foreground. To his left, another man stands in the middle ground, with other figures visible on the far left and right, also in the middle ground. In the background, stadium bleachers filled with a crowd stretch from the left to the right side of the frame. A large billboard structure is also situated in the background, directly behind the central figure. The camera slowly pulls back, a movement that gradually reveals more of the expansive billboard structure, including a digital screen on the left displaying an image of the main subject. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A bald, light-skinned man is the central figure, wearing a complex black mask over his nose and mouth that is secured by a strap over the top of his head. He is dressed in a heavy brown leather jacket with a thick, off-white shearling collar. With his left hand, he holds a microphone-like device up to his mask, with a pair of black and white headphones connected below the device. To the left behind him stands another bald, light-skinned man with a serious expression, wearing a dark vest. In the middle ground, a dark-skinned man with short hair is visible on the right, and another light-skinned man with dark hair is on the far left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds at a stadium on an overcast day. In the background, stadium bleachers are filled with a crowd dressed in yellow. As the camera rotates counterclockwise around the central figure at a low angle, the background gradually transitions from the crowded stadium to a large structure covered in various billboards, including advertisements for UPMC, xfinity, and Under Armour. One of the digital screens on the billboard displays a close-up of the main figure, set against the grey sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
