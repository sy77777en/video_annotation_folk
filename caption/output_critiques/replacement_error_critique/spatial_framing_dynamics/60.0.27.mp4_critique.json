    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, two soccer players are positioned in the middle ground on a circular platform that occupies the bottom half of the frame. The player kicking the ball is in the upper right-center, while the sliding player is in the lower left-center. The soccer ball is suspended in the air in the center-left, between the two players. The background consists of dark clouds at the top, a reddish expanse below them, and vertical streaks on the right. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two soccer players are depicted on a circular patch of green grass. One player, with dark skin and a ponytail, is in mid-air, kicking a white soccer ball with their right foot. This player wears a white jersey with red accents, white shorts, and red socks. The other player, with light skin and blonde hair tied up, is on the ground in a sliding position. This player is wearing a blue jersey with yellow details, blue shorts, and blue socks. The white soccer ball is positioned in the air between the two players.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a surreal, abstract environment on a circular platform with a green top and a grey base that appears to be floating. The background is a chaotic and painterly mix of dark, turbulent clouds at the top and a fiery, reddish-orange expanse below. On the right, the background features vertical, streaky distortions. Two figures in soccer uniforms occupy the platform; one in a white and red uniform is captured mid-air kicking a ball, while another in a blue and yellow uniform is sliding on the platform's surface. The entire composition has a digitally rendered, painterly texture with a dramatic and high-contrast color scheme.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
