    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of an architectural interior with no main subject. The tiled floor occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. A tiled column is positioned on the left, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground. A dark, textured wall section runs horizontally across the middle of the frame in the middle ground, curving along the back wall. The upper half of the frame is filled by the white tiled wall in the background, which features a series of tall, glowing windows positioned in the center and right. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up into the space and emphasizing the architectural lines and depth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, minimalist interior. The space is defined by white tiled floors and walls, with the lower portion of the walls finished in a contrasting dark, textured material. A series of tall, capsule-shaped windows glow with a bright, diffuse white light. The even light in the room suggests additional, unseen light sources. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the stark, clean geometry and liminal atmosphere of the environment itself. The composition emphasizes the architectural lines rather than a specific focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An empty indoor room features a floor and upper walls covered in a grid of small, white square tiles. The lower half of the walls is finished with a dark, textured material. In the corner, a tiled column meets a wall. A row of tall, narrow windows with rounded tops and bottoms emits a bright, diffuse white light into the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
