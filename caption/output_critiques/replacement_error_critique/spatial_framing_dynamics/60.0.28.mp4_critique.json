    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center foreground, speaking into a microphone. She is surrounded by a crowd of people in the middle ground and background. A man holding a camera is visible to her left in the middle ground, while another man with a microphone is to her right. Additional people holding cameras occupy the background, framing the central woman. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is centered, speaking into a black microphone that she holds. The microphone has a red and white logo with the word \"SPORTS\" on it. She wears a light-colored top with textured shoulders and a silver hoop earring. She is surrounded by a crowd of people who appear to be reporters. To her left, a man with light skin, wearing a dark suit, holds a professional camera with a large lens. To her right, another light-skinned man in a dark suit holds up a microphone. Other male reporters in the background are holding cameras, all focused on the interviewee she is reporting about.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a brightly lit indoor space with orange walls, a woman in a light-colored top stands at the center of a dense crowd. She holds a black microphone with a red and white logo cube towards her mouth. She is surrounded by numerous people in dark clothing who are holding up cameras with large lenses and microphones, pointing them towards the center. The tight grouping of people and equipment creates a crowded, focused environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
