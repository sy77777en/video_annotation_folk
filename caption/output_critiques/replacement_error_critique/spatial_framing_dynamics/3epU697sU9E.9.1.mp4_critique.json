    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented from a high-angle, top-down perspective, showing a map of the eastern United States that occupies the entire background. In the foreground, the label \"OFFUT AIR FORCE BASE\" is positioned in the top left, while \"JOINT BASE ANDREWS\" is located on the center-right. A dashed orange line connects these two points. A small orange airplane icon, also in the foreground, moves steadily from left to right along this dashed line, originating near the Offut Air Force Base label and progressing towards the Joint Base Andrews label.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dark map of the northeastern United States with a highlighted route connecting two locations: Offut Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews. The route is marked by a dashed orange line, suggesting a path or flight trajectory, with a small orange plane-like icon moving along the line to indicate an ongoing flight. Both bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons indicating their positions on the map. The map displays state boundaries and major cities in a subtle gray, providing geographical context. The overall visual emphasizes the connection between these two military bases.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dark, stylized map of the eastern United States is shown, with faint gray lines representing roads and state borders. The Great Lakes are visible in the upper portion of the map, and the Atlantic coastline is on the right. Overlaying the map, orange text and circles identify \"OFFUT AIR FORCE BASE\" in the west and \"JOINT BASE ANDREWS\" in the east. A dashed orange line connects the two locations, and an orange airplane icon moves from west to east along this line, indicating a flight path between the two bases.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
