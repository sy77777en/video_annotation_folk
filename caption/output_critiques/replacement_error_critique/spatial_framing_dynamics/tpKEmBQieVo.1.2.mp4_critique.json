    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is framed from a camera fixed directly below a person, whose head and upper torso remain stationary in the top-center foreground. The person glides forward through a deep gorge, with steep, forested cliffs positioned in the middle ground on the left and right sides of the frame. Below them, in the center middle ground, a valley floor with fields and a town is visible. A large mountain range extends across the background, with a clear blue sky filling the upper portion of the frame. The camera remains stationary relative to the person, creating a stable frame through which the vast landscape glides past.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person, seen from a camera positioned directly below them. The person is oriented face down, with their upper torso and the back of their head visible at the top of the frame. They are wearing a lime-green garment, possibly a wingsuit or jacket, which has a blue zipper running down the middle. The back of the person's head shows short, light brown hair, and a black strap from headgear is visible across it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot, the perspective glides forward high above a deep mountain valley. The top of a person's head and a portion of a yellow wingsuit with a blue zipper are visible at the top of the frame. Below, the landscape unfolds, revealing steep cliffs covered in dense, dark green forests that descend into a gorge. In the distance, a wider valley floor features green fields, a small town, and a road, all set against a backdrop of a massive mountain range with grey, rocky peaks. The entire scene takes place on a clear day under a bright blue sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person gliding through the air face down, with the camera fixed below them. Only part of their head and upper body are visible at the top of the frame, while a vast mountain landscape is displayed below.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
