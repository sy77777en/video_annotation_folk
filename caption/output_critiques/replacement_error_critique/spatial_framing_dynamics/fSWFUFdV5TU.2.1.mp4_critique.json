    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape at night, featuring a light-colored ledge in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A large, dark building is positioned in the center middle ground, with other city lights visible in the background. A man then enters from the right side of the frame, and the shot transitions to a medium shot of him from behind. He walks toward the center and stops in the center-right foreground, looking out at the cityscape. The camera is positioned at the man's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, dark, curly hair is revealed as he walks into the frame from the right. He is seen from behind, wearing a dark denim jacket, and he stops to look out over a cityscape at night.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point overlooking a city at night, light snow falls against a dark skyline. A large, multi-story building stands in the center, its dark facade punctuated by a few warmly lit windows. In the foreground, a person wearing a dark jacket walks up to a light-colored ledge and stands with their back to the camera, observing the cityscape. Distant building lights, including a single red one, are visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
