    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a stick figure riding a bicycle, primarily positioned in the center of the frame, moving from left to right. The stick figure is in the foreground, with a plain light gray background providing contrast. Initially, the figure is on a long horizontal line in the middle ground, next to the number \"26\" on the right. As the video progresses, the figure navigates various black lines and shapes, including ramps and jumps, which are positioned in the middle ground. The stick figure's movement is dynamic, descending and tumbling along the path, with the scarf-like accessory trailing behind. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective as the figure interacts with the evolving geometric shapes and numbers, such as \"30\" and \"34,\" which appear in the middle ground, indicating progression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a simple, animated scene with a stick figure riding a bicycle, primarily facing to the right of the frame. The stick figure is minimalistic, with basic lines representing the body and limbs, a small circle for the head, and a round hat on top. A scarf-like accessory with white, red, green, and blue accents trails behind the figure. The bicycle is drawn with simple lines, showing one visible wheel and a frame, with the figure's hands positioned on the handlebars. The stick figure moves to the right along a black line, descending and tumbling. The path includes jumps or ramps, which the stick figure navigates, suggesting playful or dynamic action. In the middle of the video, various simple line-drawn objects and numbers appear, representing additional jumping points or ramps. The overall style is minimalist, focusing on the movement of the stick figure and bicycle along the line.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a side-view perspective of the character unfolds in a minimalist, 2D environment with a plain light gray background. The scene features a small, stick-figure-like character, distinguished by a hat and colorful dots, navigating a series of black, hand-drawn lines and geometric shapes that serve as platforms. Initially, the character is seen on a long horizontal line next to the number \"26,\" with a ramp-like structure to the right and disconnected short lines to the left. As the video progresses, the character moves across various evolving black-outlined shapes, including curved ramps, triangles, and semi-circular forms, while numbers such as \"30\" and \"34\" appear, indicating progression through the abstract, monochromatic landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
