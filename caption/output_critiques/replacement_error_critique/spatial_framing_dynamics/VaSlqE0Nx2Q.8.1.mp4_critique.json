    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a snowy landscape, where a large concrete bunker is situated in the top right background and a smaller one is in the top left background. In the foreground, a thick rope lies on the snow, extending from the bottom center towards the middle ground, while bare branches occupy the right foreground. The camera then pulls back, causing the mid-torso and hands of a person to enter the frame from the left foreground. This person pulls the rope, which now stretches from their position across the middle ground. In the final composition, the person remains partially visible in the left foreground, with the bunkers now smaller in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, shot in black and white, initially focuses on a thick rope lying on a snowy ground, extending from the foreground towards the middle of the scene. As the perspective pulls back, a person becomes partially visible on the far left. This individual is seen from the waist to the hips, wearing a heavy coat. His right hand is gripping the rope and pulling with force, while his left hand is also assisting in the effort.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black-and-white outdoor scene, a large concrete bunker is situated on a small dune covered in snow and sparse grass. A second, similar structure is visible in the distance to the left. The ground in the middle ground is covered with uneven, trodden snow, revealing patches of dark earth. A thick rope lies across the snow, leading from the middle ground towards the left of the frame. A hand holding a coiled section of the rope enters the shot from the left, pulling it slightly. On the right, the bare branches of a bush are prominent in the foreground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person pulling a rope stuck in the ground. Initially, the person is not in the frame, and the video presents a wide shot of the environment. As the camera moves backward, the person gradually appears, with only a small portion of their mid-torso visible on the left side of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
