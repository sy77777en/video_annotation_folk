    "pre_caption": "The video begins from a first-person perspective, with the character holding a pistol occupying the right foreground. In the center middle ground, a second man is visible from head to toe. A large vase sits in the left middle ground, and a door is on the far left. The camera then pans to the right as the first-person character moves forward, shifting their position to the left foreground. This movement causes the second man to be repositioned into the left middle ground. The pan reveals a wooden side table with a telephone and a chair in the right middle ground, with framed portraits on the wall in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is presented from a first-person perspective, showing two men in a room. The primary character is a light-skinned, middle-aged man with dark brown hair, a full beard, and a mustache. He is dressed in a dark long coat over a vest and white shirt and is seen holding a dark pistol in his right hand. The second man, standing in the background, is a dark-skinned, middle-aged man with short black hair. He is wearing a formal dark suit, a light gray vest, a white shirt, a white bow tie, and black round sunglasses, and he stands with one hand on his chest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, pans across a dimly lit room with dark green walls and a herringbone-patterned wood floor. The space is illuminated by a single wall sconce, revealing several framed portraits of men on the walls. Furnishings include a dark wood side table with a candlestick-style telephone, a single cream-colored chair, and a large, ornate blue-and-white vase in a corner. A wooden door with a brass handle is visible to the left. Two men in period clothing are present in the room, with the character in the foreground holding a pistol.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a first-person perspective in a video game, beginning with two middle-aged male characters in a classic house. The shot size is primarily a wide shot, but due to camera and subject movements, the two figures alternate between being fully in frame and having only their upper bodies visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
