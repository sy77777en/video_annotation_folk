    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, the camera is locked onto a hockey puck in the bottom-center foreground, with the blade of a hockey stick positioned to its right. A full shot of a hockey player occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, skating forward and growing larger as they approach the camera's fixed position. The background is filled by the indoor rink, with green boards and netting spanning the lower half and a high, arched ceiling with lights and banners occupying the top portion of the frame. A few blurry water droplets are visible on the camera surface in the foreground, particularly in the top right. The camera is positioned slightly above the puck at the player's foot level, and a fisheye lens creates a wide, curved distortion of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a level perspective on an ice rink, a black, circular hockey puck with a white logo and lettering sits in the immediate foreground. Positioned directly beside the puck is the curved black blade of a hockey stick. A hockey player, who appears to be a woman, stands on skates, looking forward. She is wearing a red long-sleeved jersey, dark blue hockey pants with large white knee pads, and a white helmet. She holds the hockey stick, which extends from her gloved hands down to the ice.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot where the camera is mounted to an object on the ice, the scene unfolds inside an indoor ice hockey rink. In the immediate foreground, a black, textured hockey puck and the curved black blade of a hockey stick are visible on the white ice surface. A person wearing a red jersey, dark pants with white knee pads, and a helmet skates toward the camera's level perspective. The rink is enclosed by green boards and protective netting. Overhead, a high, arched ceiling with exposed metal beams is lit by numerous long, rectangular light fixtures, and small decorative banners hang from the structure. The use of a mild barrel distortion lens gives the entire scene a slightly wide and curved appearance.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is locked onto the hockey puck in the foreground, with a full shot of the player in a red jersey above it. The rink’s interior and ceiling structure fill the background, while a few blurry water droplets appear on the camera surface.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is locked slightly above the hockey puck in the foreground, positioned at the foot level of the player in a red jersey.",
