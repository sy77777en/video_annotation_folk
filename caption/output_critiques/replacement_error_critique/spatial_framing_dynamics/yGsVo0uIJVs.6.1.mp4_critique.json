    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a long, sunken object is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The sandy ocean floor is visible at the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. From the top of the frame, beams of light filter down through the water. The camera is positioned above the object, providing a high-angle perspective of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a large, submerged crocodile-like creature or possibly a sunken metallic structure resting on the ocean floor. Its surface is textured and mottled with shades of gray and brown, resembling rocky terrain. The elongated form is partially illuminated by beams of light filtering through the water, highlighting its rough, scaly appearance. A prominent, jagged dorsal ridge runs along the top, and its left side extends outward, tapering to a point. The right side is broad and flat, with visible ridges on the top, giving it a prehistoric appearance. There are extended structure that stick out slightly near the middle of the object, and the overall scene conveys a sense of stillness and ancient presence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an underwater scene featuring a sunken metallic structure resting on the ocean floor. The dimly lit environment is enhanced by beams of light filtering through the water, creating a serene and mysterious atmosphere. The structure, likely a shipwreck, is adorned with marine growth, showcasing a rugged texture with a blend of rusted metal and encrusted surfaces. The clear water offers a view of the sandy seabed, illuminated by dappled light. The setting is tranquil, with no visible movement, highlighting the stillness of the underwater world. An overlay element, positioned in the bottom left corner, displays \"[2]\" without obstructing the view, ensuring it remains unobtrusive within the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
