    "pre_caption": "This video presents a medium shot of people on a fast-moving ride, filmed from a camera positioned at the subjects' level. In the immediate foreground, the top of a person's head occupies the bottom center of the frame. The main subjects are in the middle ground: a woman with pink hair is located in the center-right, and a man wearing sunglasses is to her left, in the top right. They are seated within a blue and grey ride car that extends across the middle of the frame. In the background, other riders and parts of the ride are visible in the top left and center. The entire frame is in constant, shaky motion, moving with the ride, causing the background to blur and the subjects' hair to fly around their faces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a light-skinned woman with long, bright pink hair, seated on a moving ride. Her hair is flying around her face, and her mouth is open. To her left is a light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing sunglasses and a black t-shirt; his mouth is also open. In the foreground, the top of the head of a person with light brown, wavy hair is visible. In the background, other riders are seated in similar cars, including one person in a red shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **During the daytime at an amusement park, passengers are captured on a high-speed ride. The ride's cars are constructed with blue and grey components, featuring safety harnesses. In the seats behind the foreground, a woman with long, bright pink hair is visible next to a man wearing sunglasses, with other riders in the surrounding area. The rapid motion of the ride is conveyed by the blurred background and the passengers' hair blowing in the wind.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
