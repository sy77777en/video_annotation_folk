    "pre_caption": "This medium shot initially frames a man in the center middle ground, with a large, open insulated bag occupying the left foreground. In the left background, another person is visible working near a window and kitchen equipment. The man in the middle ground turns and moves toward the right, and the camera pans slightly to the right to follow his motion. He ends up on the right side of the frame, standing by a counter that enters from the right edge. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man wearing a blue short-sleeved t-shirt and a beige apron stands in a kitchen. He is initially positioned in front of a large, open, grey insulated bag. In the background, another person is visible from the back, wearing a dark blue shirt and a light blue apron tied at their waist. The man in the foreground turns to his left, moving towards a counter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a brightly lit commercial kitchen during the daytime. In the middle ground, a person wearing a blue shirt and a beige apron stands before a large, rectangular, grey insulated delivery bag with black interior straps. The background features stainless steel work surfaces, various kitchen equipment including three large stand mixers, and another individual working near a window. The person in the middle ground moves their hands and then turns toward a counter as the camera pans slightly to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
