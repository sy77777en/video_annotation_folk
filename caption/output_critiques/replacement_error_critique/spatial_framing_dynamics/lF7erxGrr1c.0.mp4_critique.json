    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high angle, a line of race cars is positioned in the middle ground, moving from the left side of the frame towards the right. In the left foreground, a white pickup truck and an ambulance are parked. The background consists of trees and spectator grandstands along the top of the frame. The camera pans to the right, following the cars as they race along the dirt track. As the pan continues, the initial group of cars moves across the center of the frame, while more cars enter from the left, filling the middle ground. The foreground vehicles on the left move towards the bottom of the frame and eventually off-screen. The cars then navigate a turn, moving from the center of the frame towards the top left as they round the bend. A text overlay remains fixed in the top right corner throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of dirt modified race cars, characterized by their open-wheel design, large side panels, and rear spoilers, are on a dirt track. The cars display a variety of color schemes and graphics; one is white with red and black markings, another is black and red, one is white with blue and red accents, and a prominent one is yellow and red. Other cars in the pack include a blue and yellow car. In the infield area, several non-racing vehicles are present, including a white pickup truck and a white ambulance with red and black stripes. A few people are also in the infield, including a man in a yellow safety vest and another person wearing pink pants.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor dirt race track is shown in the evening, illuminated by large stadium lights. A line of brightly colored modified race cars, adorned with numbers and decals, circles the brown dirt oval. The infield is a mix of grass and dirt, with several vehicles parked, including an ambulance and a white pickup truck. In the background, spectator grandstands are visible, with a line of green trees and hills beyond the track. The camera pans to follow the cars as they move along the track. A text overlay reading \"GSPVIDEO.COM\" is visible in the top right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
