    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of the car's interior, focusing on the tan leather seats and central console with air vents, positioned centrally in the frame and occupying the foreground. The camera is at the same height as the seats, providing a detailed view of the interior features. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a full shot of the black luxury sedan, now positioned in the center of the frame. The car is in the middle ground, with its open doors revealing the interior. The shiny silver alloy wheels are visible on the right side of the frame. The background features a paved parking area and a building with a flat roof, positioned towards the top of the frame. The camera remains at the car's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective on the vehicle's design and surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a black luxury sedan with its doors open, revealing a tan leather interior. The car's sleek design is highlighted by its shiny silver alloy wheels and aerodynamic shape. The interior showcases plush leather seats and a central console with air vents, emphasizing comfort and elegance. The open doors provide a clear view of the spacious and well-appointed cabin, underscoring the vehicle's premium quality and attention to detail.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors during the day in a parking area with a clear sky. A sleek black car with its doors open is prominently featured. The car's interior is visible, showcasing tan leather seats and a polished dashboard with air vents. The exterior of the car is shiny, with large silver alloy wheels. The ground is paved, and a building with a flat roof is visible in the background. The setting is calm, with no visible movement or people, emphasizing the car's design and features.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
