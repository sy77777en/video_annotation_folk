    "pre_caption": "A close-up, static shot focuses on the rear windshield of a car, which occupies the majority of the frame. The car's dark body is visible in the foreground, framing the windshield on the left, bottom, and right sides. In the middle ground, a series of white stickers is positioned in the upper right quadrant of the glass, with an additional sticker in the bottom right. A prominent reflection of the car's green interior is cast across the center of the windshield, also in the middle ground. The dark interior of the car is visible in the background through the tinted glass. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows the rear windshield of a dark green car. The tinted glass has several white vinyl stickers applied to the middle strip of the rear windshield, including logos for \"GReddy,\" \"LTD,\" \"Haltech,\" \"neutrale,\" \"TOYO TIRES,\" and \"Renown.\" A smaller, more intricate white sticker is visible in the bottom center corner. A reflection of the car's light green interior, possibly a panel or a roll cage, is cast across the windshield, along with a mirrored reflection of some of the stickers. The scene is lit by bright sunlight, which creates a strong glare in the upper right portion of the glass.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime shot focuses on the rear window of a dark green car. The tinted green window features several horizontal defroster lines. A collection of white stickers, including brand names like \"GReddy,\" \"Haltech,\" \"TOYO TIRES,\" and \"Renown,\" is arranged across the middle strip of the glass. Another sticker with an intricate design is placed on the bottom center corner. Bright sunlight creates a glare on the glass, which also reflects the car's green interior and the bright outdoor surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
