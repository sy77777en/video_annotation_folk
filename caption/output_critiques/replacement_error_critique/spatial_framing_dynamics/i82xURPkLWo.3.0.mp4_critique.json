    "pre_caption": "The video is captured in a static, full shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A standing man occupies the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. To his right, a seated man is positioned in the bottom-right, also in the middle ground, with only his upper body visible. In the foreground, a black armchair sits in the bottom-left corner. The background consists of large windows across the top and left, with a workbench and tool board on the right. The standing man extends his right arm, moving a bottle from his side toward the center of the frame to offer it to the seated man, who then reaches his left hand from the bottom-right to accept it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men inside a room with large windows. A Black man stands wearing a brown t-shirt and dark jeans, holding a red soda can in his left hand and a green beer bottle in his right. He initially looks towards the other man before offering him the beer bottle. A bald white man sits in a brown leather armchair, wearing a light blue button-down shirt and grey trousers. He looks up at the standing man and reaches out to accept the offered beer bottle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a rustic room during the daytime, with walls constructed from wood paneling and corrugated metal. Large, multi-paned windows line the walls, revealing a sunny, green landscape with trees outside. The room is furnished with a black leather armchair holding a patterned pillow and a brown leather armchair where a man is seated. Between them, a small wooden table holds a green vase and a book. In the background, a workbench is cluttered with tools and bottles, and a green tool board with neatly arranged instruments hangs on the wall. The space is illuminated solely by natural light, as the green-shaded pendant lamps hanging from the ceiling are not turned on. A second man is positioned in the center-left of the room.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of a man in a red shirt and black jeans standing and talking to another man seated on a couch in a blue shirt, with only the upper body of the second man visible in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
