    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene is framed by the photographer's arms and a camera, which occupy the foreground on the left, right, and top center of the frame. The camera is aimed towards a body of water that fills the lower half of the scene. In the middle ground, a series of wooden posts emerge from the water; one post is positioned directly in the center of the frame with a seagull perched on top. Other posts are visible to the left and receding into the background, where they are obscured by fog. A modern post with a concrete base is located in the right foreground. The camera is held at eye level, positioned above the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person with light skin, wearing a brown leather jacket, holds a black camera with both hands. The camera is aimed at a body of calm, turquoise water, out of which several weathered wooden posts emerge vertically. A small white and grey seagull is perched on top of the most prominent central post. The scene is enveloped in a thick, white fog, causing more distant posts to appear as faint silhouettes. On the right, a modern post with a square concrete base and a metal pole stands near the edge of a walkway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a person in a brown leather jacket holding a black camera, pointed towards a body of murky turquoise water on a foggy day. Several weathered wooden posts emerge from the water, with a single white and grey bird perched on the one in the center. The thick fog obscures the background, where more posts are faintly visible. To the right, a modern post with a concrete base stands at the water's edge. The water has gentle ripples, and the overall scene is cast in a muted, grey light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
