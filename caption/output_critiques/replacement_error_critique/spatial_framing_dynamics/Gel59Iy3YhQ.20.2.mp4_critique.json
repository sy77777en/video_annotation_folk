    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's height. A pixelated character sits in the bottom left foreground next to a campfire in the center foreground. A forest of pine trees occupies the middle ground, with a dark sky in the background. A game HUD is overlaid across the top of the frame. The camera then performs a vertical tilt upward, causing the character, campfire, and forest to move down and disappear from the bottom of the frame. The shot resolves on the starry night sky, which now fills the entire view, while the HUD remains fixed in its position at the top.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated character, resembling a knight, sits on the ground next to a small campfire. The knight wears blue armor and a helmet adorned with two large horns. The small, flickering campfire casts a yellow glow on the ground. The knight and the campfire then disappear from the bottom of the view, leaving only the dark, starry night sky visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, a pixelated scene is set in a dark forest at night. Tall, dark pine trees are silhouetted against a deep blue and black sky. A small campfire burns in a clearing, casting an orange glow on the grassy ground where a character in armor is seated. The view then moves upward, past the treetops, to reveal a black sky filled with small, twinkling stars. A heads-up display is overlaid at the top of the screen, showing game statistics for 'GOLD', 'ITEM', 'LIFE', and 'BOSS' with corresponding icons and values.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.",
