    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a classic car, capturing its entirety within the frame. The car is centrally positioned in the 2D space, occupying the middle of the frame horizontally and vertically. In the 3D space, the car is situated in the foreground, with no other objects or elements in the middle ground or background. The camera remains at the car's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no noticeable changes in the car's position or the camera's angle, ensuring the vehicle remains the focal point. The dimly lit indoor setting surrounds the car, with soft shadows enhancing its contours. The overlay text \"[6]\" is consistently located in the lower left corner of the frame, adding a minor detail without altering the primary focus on the car. The spatial framing remains static, emphasizing the car's design and form without any dynamic shifts or transitions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a classic car with a rounded, vintage design, reminiscent of mid-20th-century models. It has a smooth, beige exterior with distinct curves and a compact body. The car's front is characterized by round headlights and a simple bumper, while the side view reveals a one-door configuration with rounded windows. The wheels are partially visible, and the overall appearance is sleek and well-maintained, highlighting its timeless design.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an indoor setting with a classic car as the central focus. The environment is dimly lit, creating a subdued atmosphere with soft shadows. The car, a vintage model with a rounded shape, features a beige color and smooth, polished metal surfaces. Its distinct design includes rounded headlights and a curved roof. The floor is dark and unadorned, complementing the car's presence. The lighting highlights the car's contours, emphasizing its classic form. An overlay element displaying the text \"[6]\" is positioned in the lower left corner, providing minimal information without distracting from the main focus on the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
