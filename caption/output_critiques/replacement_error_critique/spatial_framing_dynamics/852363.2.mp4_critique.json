    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot featuring a woman positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. To her right, a man is partially visible in the foreground, and he briefly turns his head to the right. The background is out of focus. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with light skin and shoulder-length, pink-dyed hair with dark roots is smiling. She is positioned slightly left of center in the frame, wearing a dark top that exposes her right shoulder. To her left, on the right side of the frame, a man with short black hair is partially visible, wearing a dark T-shirt. At the beginning of the video, he briefly turns his head to the right, revealing half of his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a softly lit, close-up shot, a woman with light pink hair is seen smiling. The background is indistinct and blurry, composed of a mix of soft colors and shapes, suggesting a decorated or painted interior wall. To her left, on the right side of the frame, the shoulder and side of another person wearing a dark shirt are partially visible. At the beginning of the video, this individual briefly turns his head to the right, momentarily revealing half of his face. The overall lighting is gentle, creating a warm and slightly hazy atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
