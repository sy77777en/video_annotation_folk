    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up, low-angle shot from a chest-mounted camera, a man in a wingsuit occupies the bottom-center foreground. His hands are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right, holding black risers that extend upward. In the middle ground, a white parachute is centered at the top of the frame, initially partially open. As the man looks up, his head moves into the center of the frame, and the parachute fully inflates, dominating the upper half. The background consists of a blue sky, steep canyon walls on the far right, and the sun in the top right, which creates a prominent lens flare. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a reddish-brown beard is seen from a low-angle view, captured by a camera mounted on his chest, as he looks up towards the sky. He is wearing a bright yellow wingsuit with blue zippers on the chest, a helmet, and dark-lensed goggles. His hands are gripping the black risers of a white parachute that is open and inflated directly above him. The parachute has black lettering on its surface, spelling \"Go Pro.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted on a person, captures the perspective of looking up from a bright yellow jumpsuit as a white parachute with black lettering inflates overhead. The scene takes place outdoors on a clear, sunny day within a deep canyon, flanked by steep, dark rock faces. The bright blue sky is visible above, with the sun causing a significant lens flare as the person holds onto the black parachute risers.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
