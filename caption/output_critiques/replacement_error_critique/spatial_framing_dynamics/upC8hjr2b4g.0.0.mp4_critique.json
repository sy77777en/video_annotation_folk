    "pre_caption": "A full shot, filmed from a high angle, captures a disclaimer printed on a white paper banner. The banner is positioned in the foreground and middle ground, filling most of the frame. The word \"DISCLAIMER\" is located at the top center, with the main warning text directly below it in the center of the frame. The paper is draped over a surface visible at the bottom of the frame. Partially visible columns of text are positioned on the left and right sides of the central message. The shot remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows a disclaimer printed on a white surface, which appears to be a banner or a large sheet of paper placed on a table with a wood grain pattern. The scene is cast in a cool, blue light. At the top, the word \"DISCLAIMER\" is written in a large, black, all-caps serif font. A solid black horizontal line separates the title from the body of the text below, which reads, \"THIS VIDEO DISCUSSES SUICIDE, VIOLENCE, AND ABUSE INFLICTED UPON CHILDREN. PLEASE TAKE CARE WHEN WATCHING.\" To the left and right of this central message, other columns of smaller, less legible text are partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up, static shot focuses on a white paper banner with black text, set against a cool, blue-toned background that suggests dim, nighttime lighting. The word \"DISCLAIMER\" is printed in a large, bold, serif font across the top. Below it, a warning reads: \"THIS VIDEO DISCUSSES SUICIDE, VIOLENCE, AND ABUSE INFLICTED UPON CHILDREN. PLEASE TAKE CARE WHEN WATCHING.\" The paper, slightly wrinkled and draped, casts soft shadows and appears to be placed on a table with a wood-grain pattern. Faint, out-of-focus columns of smaller text are visible on either side of the central message, resembling the layout of a newspaper.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
