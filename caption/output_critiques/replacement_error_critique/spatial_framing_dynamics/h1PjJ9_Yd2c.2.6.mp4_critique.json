    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a young man is framed from the chest up, positioned in the center-right of the frame and occupying the middle ground. Initially, he holds his hand near his mouth. He then moves his right hand to the right side of his head, near his ear, while slightly tilting his head to his left. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's eye level throughout the shot. A dark, out-of-focus shape is visible in the background to the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with short, dark hair styled upwards. He is wearing a white dress shirt and a striped tie. In the first part, he is seen with his hand near his mouth, appearing thoughtful. Later, he places his right hand near his right ear, appearing to rub his ear, maintaining a similar contemplative expression. The lighting is soft, highlighting his facial features and creating a calm atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, likely in a room with muted lighting, suggesting a calm, introspective atmosphere. Although the desk and bottle are not prominently visible, the everyday environment is still conveyed through subtle details. The time of day appears to be daytime, as indicated by the soft, natural light filtering in, creating gentle shadows. The color palette is subdued, with neutral tones dominating the scene. The overall composition is simple, focusing on the interaction within the space, with no significant movement or changes in the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
