    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a wooden electric chair positioned in the center background. A white window frame is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the screen, partially obscuring the base of the chair. To the right of the chair, in the background, an electrical box is mounted on the wall. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot that focuses more tightly on the upper structure of the chair, which remains centered in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A low-resolution, grainy video displays a wooden electric chair from a slightly low angle. The dark brown chair has a high back with three horizontal slats. Straps are attached to the armrests and the front legs, and various wires are connected to the structure. The bottom of the chair is obscured by a white window frame in the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dark wooden electric chair stands in a stark, institutional room with light-colored walls. The chair has a high back with horizontal slats, and visible restraints are attached to its arms and legs, with wires running from it. To the right of the chair, a small electrical box is mounted on the wall. The scene is viewed from a fixed position, with the bottom of the chair partially obscured by a white window frame in the foreground. The video quality is grainy, and the colors are muted. A small white watermark in the lower left corner reads \"[12,22]; ABC News (1989).\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
