    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot where a crocodile is positioned in the middle ground, towards the right side of the frame, facing right. It floats in murky water, which is relatively calm with minor ripples, occupying most of the middle ground of the scene; its faint reflection is visible beneath it. On the left side of the frame, out-of-focus green plant stems are present in the foreground. The crocodile remains relatively still throughout the shot. The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a crocodile floating in murky, brownish-green water. The crocodile is mostly submerged, with the top of its head, including its eyes and mouth, and the upper ridge of its scaly, greenish-brown back visible above the surface. It appears relatively still, facing towards the right side of the scene, and its reflection is faintly visible on the water. In the out-of-focus foreground to the left, several thin, green plant stems are present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene centered on a body of murky, brownish water, likely a river. In the foreground, blurred green vegetation, possibly reeds, partially obscures the view. A crocodile is partially submerged in the water, positioned towards the bottom center of the frame and facing away from the camera. Its textured, greenish-brown head and upper back are visible above the water's surface, reflecting slightly. The water is relatively calm with minor ripples. The scene appears to be set during the daytime under subdued lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
