    "pre_caption": "The video features two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, positioned in front of a large aquarium. The subject on the right, a woman, occupies the full frame height and is located on the right side in the middle ground. The central subject, a child, occupies about 40% of the frame height and is positioned in the center, also in the middle ground. Both subjects are facing away from the viewer, observing colorful fish swimming in the foreground. The fish move dynamically across the frame, adding motion to the scene. The background consists of a building structure visible through the aquarium glass, suggesting an indoor setting. The camera is at the subjects' height, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera. The subject on the right, occupying the full frame height, appears to be a woman standing upright with her hands on her hips. The central subject, approximately 40% of the frame height, seems to be a child wearing a hooded outfit. Both figures are positioned facing away from the viewer, observing a group of colorful fish swimming in front of them. The fish vary in size and color, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The setting suggests an aquarium environment, with the subjects appearing to move upward, possibly because the platform they are on is ascending, as they watch the aquatic life.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a scene from an objective perspective, showing two figures standing in front of a large glass aquarium filled with various fish swimming inside. Through the glass, the background reveals a building structure, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a public aquarium or museum exhibit. The lighting is dim, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere. The two figures appear to be observing the fish.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, revealing their bodies above the calf. The subject on the right occupies full frame height, while the one in the center occupies 40% of the frame height. In front of them, a group of fish swims past, suggesting a setting resembling an aquarium.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
