    "pre_caption": "In an initial full shot from a level perspective, two men are positioned in the foreground, with one in the center-left and the other to his left. In the middle ground, a purple-seated ATV is on the right, while another ATV with a rider is in the center. A third man stands in the background to the right. The camera then moves directly upward, transitioning to a high-angle, top-down view. From this new perspective, the man in the black hoodie is now in the center-left of the frame, the man in the patterned coat is at the bottom-center, the purple-seated ATV is on the right, and the pink ATV is at the top-center, with a wooden pallet now visible in the top-left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the middle ground, two dark-skinned men are featured. The man initially positioned in the center-left wears a black patterned coat over a black hooded sweatshirt and a gray-and-white scarf, gesturing toward the camera. To his right, another man in a black hooded sweatshirt with a graphic on the chest and a silver necklace also gestures. They stand near three custom all-terrain vehicles. The closest ATV has a purple seat, wide tires, and iridescent blue and purple details on its frame and fenders. Further back, a man wearing a black beanie and black hooded sweatshirt sits on a pink and black ATV, with another man in a black jacket and a red beanie standing behind him near another ATV in the middle ground. As the camera cranes up, the two men move to the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a large, paved industrial lot at dusk, with a pale sky visible above a line of distant buildings and shipping containers. Several customized all-terrain vehicles are parked on the asphalt. One ATV on the right has a purple seat and iridescent, multi-colored bodywork with wide tires. Another ATV is pink and black. A wooden pallet rests on the ground nearby. The camera's perspective shifts from a hip-level view to a high-angle, top-down shot, focusing on the vehicles with purple seats and the men wearing jackets over black hoodies near it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
