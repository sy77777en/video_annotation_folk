    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. A rectangular computer screen, angled slightly to the left, occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. Its display transitions through three distinct interfaces: initially, a menu with \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet\" highlighted, then a network testing status screen, and finally, a list of arcade games. A blurry portion of a person's light-toned hair is visible in the foreground on the right side of the frame. In the middle ground, to the bottom right of the screen, a stack of colorful magazines is present. The background consists of light purple, vertically striped wallpaper. A white text overlay, \"Footage of Xbox 360 PartnerNet Game Leaks | MVO (2020),\" is positioned in the bottom left corner of the foreground throughout the video. The framing and camera position remain static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a rectangular computer screen with a dark bezel, displaying a sequence of user interfaces. Initially, a menu with white text on a dark blue-grey background lists options such as \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet\" (highlighted in light green), \"Clear Xbox Live configuration,\" and \"Create a new profile.\" The screen then transitions to show \"Testing Network Connection\" and \"Logging on to Xbox Live: 0 seconds.\" Finally, it displays a list of arcade games, including \"Banjo-Kazooie\" and \"Burnout™ CRASH!,\" each accompanied by a small icon, the game title, the label \"Arcade Game,\" and a \"0/200\" score, all on a light green background with several square icons to the right. Partially visible on the right side of the screen is a blurry, light-toned object, which is actually a person's hair. Below and to the right of the screen, a stack of colorful magazines or books is present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video predominantly features a full shot of the screen, captured in an Over-the-Shoulder (OTS) shot with a person who has light pink hair, slightly out of focus, positioned in front of the computer on the right side of the frame. The screen displays a menu with white text on a dark blue-green background, offering options such as \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet,\" \"Clear Xbox Live configuration,\" \"Change Xbox Live environment,\" \"Create a new profile,\" \"Manage profiles,\" and \"Delete All profiles.\" The first option, \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet,\" is highlighted with a light green bar. The screen then transitions to show \"Testing Network Connection\" and \"Logging on to Xbox Live: 0 seconds.\" Finally, it displays a list of arcade games, including \"Banjo-Kazooie,\" \"Banjo-Tooie,\" \"Burgertime World Tour,\" \"Burnout™ CRASH!,\" and \"Crimson Alliance,\" each with \"Arcade Game\" and \"0/200\" next to them. The background features a light purple, vertically striped wallpaper and a stack of colorful magazines on the right. An overlay at the bottom left corner reads \"[9,15]: Modern Vintage Gaming - The Story of Xbox 360 PartnerNet Game Leaks | MVO (2020)\" in white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
