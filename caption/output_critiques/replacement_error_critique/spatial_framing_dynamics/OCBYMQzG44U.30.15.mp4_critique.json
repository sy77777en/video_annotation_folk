    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot. Initially, a rough-textured wall dominates the left foreground and middle ground, with a white-tiled walkway extending from the bottom foreground towards an arched doorway in the center background. A dark, tiled area is visible in the bottom right foreground and middle ground. As the viewpoint moves forward, the left wall recedes, and the walkway leads towards the doorway, which remains in the center background but appears closer, while the dark tiled area expands in the bottom right. The camera then pans to the right, shifting the arched doorway to the left background. The frame now shows a large expanse of the room, with the dark tiled floor prominent in the foreground and middle ground, a white tiled section in the center middle ground, and white tiled walls with a grey band above them in the middle ground and background. A large circular ceiling light is visible at the top center. The camera maintains an eye-level perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, focusing on the environment and atmosphere of a stark, modern space.The camera reveals a room where white ceramic tiles line the floor and the lower portion of the walls, creating a contrast with the rough gray-textured surface above. There is a rectangular area on the floor outlined with dark tiles, where reflections are clearly visible. An arched doorway with a dark interior stands at the far end. The scene is illuminated by a large circular ceiling light and smaller spotlights, creating a sterile ambiance. There is no main subject, as the intention is to showcase the architectural design, the interplay of light and shadow, and the overall mood of the space, emphasizing its scale and minimalist aesthetic rather than a particular focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, reveals a large, brightly lit indoor space as the viewpoint moves forward and then pans to the right. The room's walls are divided, with a lower band of rough, grey-brown textured material and an upper section of white, small square tiles. The floor features an outer edge lined with white tiles, followed by a band of black tiles, and a central rectangular section made of white tiles. A white ceiling features a large, circular light fixture and smaller recessed lights. At the far end, an arched doorway with a dark interior is visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
