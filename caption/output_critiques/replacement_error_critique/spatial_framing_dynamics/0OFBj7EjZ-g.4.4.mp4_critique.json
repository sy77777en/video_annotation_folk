    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of numerous wooden pallets arranged in a grid-like pattern across a flat surface. The pallets occupy the foreground and middle ground, extending towards the background. Initially, metallic components hover above the pallets, positioned centrally in the frame and distributed evenly throughout the scene. These metallic structures are in the upper middle ground, creating a layered effect over the pallets. As the video progresses, the metallic components gradually descend, aligning directly on top of the pallets. This transition shifts the metallic elements from an elevated position to one that is level with the pallets, maintaining their central placement within the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, capturing the entire arrangement from a consistent perspective. The background features geometrically patterned walls, which remain static and unchanging, framing the scene from behind. The overall spatial dynamics highlight the interaction between the descending metallic components and the stationary pallets, emphasizing the alignment and uniformity of the grid-like structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a dynamic scene with numerous wooden pallets arranged in a grid-like pattern on a flat surface. Each pallet has a metallic component above it. These metal components have smooth, reflective surfaces and sharp, angular edges. The pallets are uniformly spaced and have a natural wood texture, contrasting with the sleek metallic forms. The arrangement highlights a juxtaposition of natural and industrial elements, with the metallic structures resting atop the static pallets.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a modern, industrial aesthetic. The environment features a spacious room with a grid-patterned floor and numerous wooden pallets arranged in rows. The pallets are made of light brown wood, showcasing a simple, rectangular shape with visible slats. Above the pallets, abstract, metallic structures with irregular edges and a flat shape are suspended, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The walls in the background have a geometric design with angular patterns, contributing to the contemporary feel. The lighting is neutral, suggesting an artificial source, and there are no visible windows or natural light. In the lower-left corner, the overlay includes the text \"[15],\" providing additional information without obstructing the view of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
