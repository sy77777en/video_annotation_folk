    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from a forward-facing, point-of-view perspective on a moving train. The scene is framed by a dark, overhanging structure in the immediate foreground, which covers the top and sides of the shot. In the center, wet railway tracks begin in the bottom foreground and extend into the middle ground, curving towards the left. These tracks are flanked on the left and right by green, tree-covered hills in the middle ground, with some buildings visible among the trees on the left. The bright, overcast sky is visible in the background at the top center of the frame. The camera moves rapidly forward, following the curve of the tracks, causing the scenery on the periphery to blur heavily while the central path remains more focused, creating a strong sense of depth and speed. The camera is positioned at an elevated height, looking straight ahead along the railway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a high-speed, point-of-view scenery shot from the front of a train, capturing the rapid movement of the train. During the movement, it passes through a dark, covered section of track into a bright, open landscape. The camera looks down a set of wet, reflective tracks that curve into the distance, flanked by lush green hills covered in dense trees. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the dynamic experience of rapid travel and the immersive atmosphere of the journey. The composition uses the rushing scenery and leading lines of the track to emphasize the feeling of speed rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the front of a fast-moving vehicle, the scene captures a forward-facing view along a set of brown, reflective railway tracks. The tracks are elevated and curve to the left through a landscape of green, tree-covered hills. Some buildings are visible in the distance and on both sides among the trees. The vehicle passes under a dim, overhanging structure that frames the top and sides of the view. The high speed of travel, combined with a time-lapse effect, causes the periphery to be heavily blurred, while the central path of the tracks also becomes streaked. Ahead, the sky is bright and overcast. Small green lights are positioned on posts alongside the tracks near the overhanging structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
