    "pre_caption": "In this extreme wide shot captured from a high angle above the subjects, a man and a woman are positioned in the center middle ground. They are walking away from the camera along a narrow sandbar that extends from the bottom center towards the top center of the frame. Clear water flanks the sandbar on the left and right sides. Further down the sandbar, in the center background, several smaller figures are visible. The central couple maintains their position in the center of the frame as they walk forward, remaining in the middle ground with minimal change in their size relative to the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man and a woman walking side by side along a narrow, sandy beach with clear, shallow water on either side. The man, on the right, is wearing a dark t-shirt and shorts, while the woman, on the left, is dressed in a black tank top and shorts. Both are barefoot, leaving footprints in the sand as they walk. Their shadows are cast on the sand, indicating the sun is overhead. In the distance, two more people are visible, walking further along the beach. The scene conveys a sense of leisure and tranquility.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of an outdoor scene during the daytime. The setting is a narrow sandbar made of white sand, marked with footprints, extending meanderingly across the frame. This sandbar is surrounded on both sides by calm, clear, light-blue ocean water with small ripples near the shore. Two people, a man and a woman, are seen from behind, walking hand-in-hand along the sandbar away from the viewer. Further in the distance, along the same sandbar, several other smaller figures are visible. The lighting suggests a clear day, casting distinct shadows of the couple onto the sand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
