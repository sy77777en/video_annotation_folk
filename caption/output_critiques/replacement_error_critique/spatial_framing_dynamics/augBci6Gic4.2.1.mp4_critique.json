    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman stands in the left middle ground, while a man is seated in the right middle ground. Several spotlights are visible in the top background against a black backdrop. The woman then turns and walks behind the man, moving from the left side of the frame to the right middle ground, where she stands behind him. The man remains seated on the right, turning his head slightly to his left as she moves. The camera is static and positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with a serious expression stands over a seated man in a dimly lit space. She wears a black and white striped, long-sleeved shirt with a scoop neck and a black turban-style headwrap, gesturing with her hands while speaking. The man, who is sitting and looking up at her, has short blond hair and a light beard. He is dressed in a red and white plaid button-up shirt, worn open over a grey t-shirt, with the sleeves rolled up. His expression is one of concern as he listens to the woman. Then, she turns and walks past him on his left, moving to stand behind him on his left side. As she continues to talk, the man seems to be deep in thought, occasionally glancing back at her. His response eventually makes her laugh.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dark, minimalist setting against a solid black background. Illumination is provided by several circular spotlights positioned overhead, which cast distinct pools of cool, bluish-white light. However, the light illuminating the man and woman appears to be a warm, yellow hue. The space is otherwise unadorned, with the black void extending in all directions beyond the focused light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
