    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, shows rows of stylized figures in computer cubicles. Initially, a figure in the foreground is positioned on the bottom left. In the middle ground, several figures are seated in a row that extends from the left to the center. More rows of figures are visible in the background. The camera slowly pans from left to right, shifting the composition. As it moves, the figures initially in the middle ground become more central, and a red cubicle partition enters the frame from the right, occupying the middle ground. The pan reveals additional rows of figures and cubicles on the right side of the room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of stylized, low-polygon human figures are seated in rows within a dark room. The figures, all rendered in a faceted white or light gray material, are positioned in black office chairs at individual computer cubicles. Some figures wear hoodies, while others are depicted in collared shirts. They are all focused on old, beige CRT monitors with glowing white screens. One figure in the foreground rests their chin on their hand as they look at the screen. The figures are using black keyboards and mice at their stations.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, underground room, rows of black computer cubicles are arranged in a grid. Each station is equipped with an old, boxy CRT monitor emitting a bright white glow, a keyboard, and a black office chair. Stylized, white, low-polygon figures are seated at the computers, their forms illuminated by the light from the screens. The camera moves forward and to the right, revealing the extent of the room. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"China, 2000s\" in a white font.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
