    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor, white-tiled environment with pools. Initially, a small, dark green pool is positioned in the bottom right foreground, while a larger expanse of water stretches from the center-bottom middle ground into the background. A white tiled wall occupies the left foreground and middle ground. Bright, elongated lights are visible on the ceiling at the top of the frame and on distant walls in the background, reflecting on the water. Several large, white cylindrical pillars rise from the larger pool, with one prominent pillar in the center-right middle ground and others further in the background. As the camera moves forward with a slight upward tilt, the small foreground pool recedes from the bottom right of the frame. The larger body of water appears to expand, occupying more of the lower half of the frame from the foreground to the deep background, and more of the distant pillars and the vastness of the space are revealed. The ceiling lights become more prominent due to the upward tilt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures an interior architectural scene featuring a white-tiled room with a series of pools. Initially, a small pool is visible in the lower right corner, while a larger pool stretches out in the distance. As the camera moves forward, it reveals an even more expansive body of water. Bright, even illumination from rows of fluorescent lights on the ceiling and walls reflects off the water's surface, creating a shimmering effect. Prominent white cylindrical pillars rise from the main body of water. The camera's forward movement and slight upward tilt enhance the sense of scale and reveal the vastness of the space, emphasizing its liminal, dreamlike quality. The focus is on the eerie ambiance created by the stark white surfaces, reflective water, and uniform bright lighting, rather than on a specific subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates an expansive indoor space characterized by white tiled walls and floors. The room contains multiple pools of dark green, rippling water. As the camera moves forward, the smaller, rectangular pool initially visible in the foreground disappears from the bottom right corner of the frame. Meanwhile, the larger body of water extends from the center-bottom of the frame into the background, punctuated by several large, smooth white cylindrical columns. The bright, elongated white light fixtures mounted on the high ceiling reflect on the water's surface, illuminating the stark, minimalist environment. The two massive columns, the bright ceiling, and the surrounding walls align closely with the frame, enhancing the immersive experience.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
