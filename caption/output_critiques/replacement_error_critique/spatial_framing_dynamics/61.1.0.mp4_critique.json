    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The shot is framed from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the blurred silhouette of another person visible in the left foreground. In the background, other indistinct figures are seated, with a soft red light glowing in the top-center. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the framing remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light brown skin, a buzz cut, and a graying goatee sits and speaks, appearing to converse with someone who is blurred on the left side of the frame. He is wearing a cream-colored, short-sleeved, collared shirt with a zip-up front and black and white vertical patterns on the chest. He gestures with his right index finger while looking slightly down and to his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder point of view, the scene is set within a dimly lit indoor establishment, likely a bar or diner at night. The environment is characterized by warm, muted lighting with prominent green and yellow hues, and a soft red light glows in the background. A man wearing a cream-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt with black geometric patterns sits at a red booth. The background is softly blurred, showing the indistinct figures of other patrons, including one in a multi-colored striped shirt. Yellow subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the screen, displaying the dialogue: \"Wet your finger man. Don't drool on it just lick it man. Come on.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
