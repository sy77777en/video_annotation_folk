    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, captured at the subject's level, features a hydrofoil catamaran positioned in the middle ground. Initially, the catamaran is slightly right of the center of the frame, moving towards the right. The choppy water occupies the foreground and extends into the lower middle ground. In the background, a city skyline spans the upper left to the upper center of the frame, with an overcast sky visible at the very top. As the video progresses, the catamaran continues its movement towards the right side of the frame, maintaining its middle ground position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a light blue hydrofoil catamaran sailing swiftly across a choppy, dark blue-green body of water. The catamaran is equipped with two large sails that are primarily blue and white, accented with red stripes. The sail in the distance features the \"ORACLE\" logo, while the closer sail displays the \"PROTECT OUR FUTURE\" logo. Its hull features red and white stripes, and at the front of the hull, there is a triangular sail that is primarily blue with red stripes and some white accents. This sail features a gold \"ROLEX\" logo and text set against a black parallelogram background. The boat is elevated above the water on its hydrofoils, creating a significant white wake as it moves. In the distant background, a hazy, greyish city skyline with numerous buildings is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a light blue hydrofoil catamaran moving swiftly across choppy, dark blue-green water during the daytime, with the San Francisco city skyline visible in the distance under an overcast sky. Mist and clouds partially obscure the tops of some tall buildings. The catamaran's hull is adorned with \"PROTECT OUR FUTURE\" in large lettering and red and white accents, while its light blue sails feature red designs and sponsor logos like \"ORACLE\" and \"ROLEX.\" A prominent white wake trails behind the vessel as it glides over the water, with glimpses of distant shoreline greenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
