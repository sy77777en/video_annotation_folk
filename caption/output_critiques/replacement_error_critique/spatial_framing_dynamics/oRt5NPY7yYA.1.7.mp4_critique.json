    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle, top-down shot, a multi-lane road extends horizontally across the center of the frame, with a sandy landscape visible at the top and bottom. A convoy of vehicles occupies the middle ground on the road. A large semi-truck with a white trailer is positioned in the center of the frame. It is escorted by five smaller, military-style vehicles, also in the middle ground, with three located to the left of the truck and two to its right, all arranged in a staggered formation. Bright blue, zig-zagging lines connect all the vehicles, forming a web-like pattern that spans horizontally across the central portion of the frame. The camera remains stationary, maintaining its overhead perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a convoy of vehicles travels along a paved road. In the center of the formation is a large semi-trailer truck with a dark cab and a long, white, rectangular trailer. This truck is escorted by five smaller, olive-green, military-style vehicles, with three positioned in front and two behind. A network of bright blue, crackling lines of energy connects all six vehicles, linking each military truck to the others and to the semi-truck, forming a web-like pattern over the convoy.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down view of a multi-lane asphalt road cutting through a barren, sandy landscape during the day. The road is marked with white dashed lines and a central double yellow line. Several military-green vehicles and a white semi-trailer truck are positioned on the road, casting dark shadows on the pavement. A network of bright blue, lightning-like energy beams connects all the vehicles, zig-zagging between them across the lanes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
