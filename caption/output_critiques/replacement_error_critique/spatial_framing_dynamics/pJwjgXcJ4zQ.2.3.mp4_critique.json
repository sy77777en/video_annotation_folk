    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from an eye-level perspective, moves forward down a narrow city street. A construction site fenced off with white panels and orange traffic cones occupies the left foreground and extends into the left middle ground, where a worker is present. On the right, a restaurant with a yellow and brown facade is situated in the middle ground. Several pedestrians are visible; one man walks from the center middle ground toward the camera before exiting on the right. He is followed by another man in a denim jacket who walks from the center middle ground, moves toward the center foreground, and passes the camera on the right. Other people, including a worker in a yellow vest, are located further back in the center middle ground and background. The scene is framed by tall buildings on both the left and right, which recede into the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a bustling urban street scene with several pedestrians and various storefronts. People of diverse appearances are walking along the sidewalk, some wearing casual clothing like jeans and jackets, while others are workers in uniforms with yellow highlights and helmets. A man in a denim jacket and cap, wearing a face mask, is prominently visible walking towards the camera. Brightly lit signs and advertisements adorn the buildings, adding vibrant colors to the scene. Traffic cones line the street, indicating possible construction or restricted areas. The overall atmosphere is lively, with a mix of individuals engaged in their daily activities.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing a bustling urban street scene in a narrow alley lined with tall buildings. The setting is outdoors, likely in a city known for its vibrant signage, as colorful neon signs and advertisements adorn the buildings. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, with natural light illuminating the scene. The street is flanked by a variety of shops and restaurants, their windows displaying bright posters and menus. Orange traffic cones line the sidewalk, guiding pedestrians and indicating ongoing maintenance or construction. The pavement is entirely asphalt, with varying degrees of wear creating the impression of different sections. People walk along the street, some wearing casual attire, contributing to the lively atmosphere. The overall environment is dynamic, with a sense of movement and activity typical of a busy city street.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
