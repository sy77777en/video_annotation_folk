    "pre_caption": "The shot opens with the choppy water filling the lower half of the frame, while the front portion of a red and white catamaran is positioned in the upper right. The camera, positioned low and at the subject's level, pans left and tilts up, following the catamaran as it moves across the screen. This movement brings the entire vessel into a medium shot, centered in the frame. The shot then widens, repositioning the red catamaran into the right foreground as it moves toward the left. Concurrently, a second, darker catamaran appears in the left middle ground, with a distant shoreline and a bridge spanning the background at the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a red and white racing catamaran moving at high speed on the water. The catamaran is a hydrofoil, with its two long, pointed hulls lifted above the surface. These hulls are primarily red with a white section, and red text is visible on the white section. The main body connecting the hulls is also red and white. Its tall, white sail displays red and black markings, including the bottom half of a red \"X\" and a green and gold \"ROLEX\" logo. At least two people, wearing dark outfits and helmets, are visible on the deck of this catamaran. In the background, a second, darker-colored catamaran, possibly black or dark blue, with a dark sail, is also present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed sailing race across a large body of choppy, dark blue-green water under an overcast sky. A red and white racing catamaran, its hulls lifted above the surface on hydrofoils, speeds forward, creating a prominent white wake and spray. In the background, a second, dark-hulled catamaran sails on a similar course. A hazy shoreline with a distant city and a large bridge is visible on the horizon.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a boat moving in the sea. It begins with a view of the sea, where only a small part of the red boat appears in the upper-right corner. The camera then tilts upward and pans left, following the boat’s movement until the entire boat comes into frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
