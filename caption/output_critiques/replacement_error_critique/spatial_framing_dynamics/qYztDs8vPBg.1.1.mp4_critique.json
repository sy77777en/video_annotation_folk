    "pre_caption": "In a static, overhead close-up shot, a pair of hands is centered in the foreground, holding a gold-colored watch and a black electronic device over a white surface. The watch is held partially over a clear plastic stand in the middle ground. To the left, a vertically oriented smartphone is in the top-left middle ground, with colored pencils and an orange lighter positioned below it. In the top-center background, a white tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it is visible, while a screwdriver rests in the middle ground on the right. The right hand presses the tip of the electronic device against the watch face, causing the device's indicator lights to progressively illuminate from green to red, reaching the highest level on the scale.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man's light-skinned hands hold a gold-colored wristwatch and a black electronic device over a white surface. The left hand, wearing a gold ring, steadies the watch, which has a round, gold-colored face with the brand name \"TISSOT\" and a textured gold band. The right hand presses the pointed tip of a black handheld device, labeled \"DIAMOND SELECTOR II,\" against the watch's crystal. The device's indicator lights are fully illuminated up to the red section. To the left of the hands, a black smartphone is positioned vertically with its camera app open, next to an orange BIC lighter and a row of colored pencils. In the background, a white rectangular object with the text \"JerryRigEverything\" is visible, and a small screwdriver with a blue and silver handle lies on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot, where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective, captures a scene on a white tabletop. A pair of hands holds a gold-colored watch with a textured band against a black electronic device labeled \"DIAMOND SELECTOR II.\" The tip of the device touches the watch face, and a row of LED lights on its scale illuminates. The tabletop is also occupied by a smartphone with its camera app open, an orange lighter, a set of colorful tools, a small screwdriver, and a white and black tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed on it. The watch is partially supported by a clear plastic stand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
