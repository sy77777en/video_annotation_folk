    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a man's face is positioned in the center foreground. Initially, his features are mostly obscured in darkness, with a faint blue light visible on the right side of his face. As the shot progresses, a hazy, reddish-purple light emerges and intensifies, surrounding his head and bringing his face into full view while he remains fixed in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, dark hair, a beard, and a mustache is shown in a close-up, looking directly forward. He wears a white t-shirt with dark-colored sleeves. His eyes are wide open, and his mouth is slightly agape. The man is illuminated by stylized lighting, with blue light on one side of his face and a reddish-purple light on the other, all set against a dark background. A hazy, colorful aura in shades of red and purple surrounds his head, and reflections in his eyes create the appearance of them glowing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark and indistinct setting, a man's face emerges from the shadows, initially lit by a faint blue light. The illumination gradually intensifies, transitioning into a hazy and swirling combination of red and deep purple light that fills the space. The background remains completely obscured in darkness as the vibrant, saturated colors wash over the central figure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
