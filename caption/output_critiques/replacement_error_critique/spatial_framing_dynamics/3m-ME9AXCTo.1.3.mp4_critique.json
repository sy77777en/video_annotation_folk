    "pre_caption": "A man and a woman are featured in a medium close-up shot, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. Throughout the clip, they slowly rotate as they dance, causing their positions relative to the camera to shift continuously while they remain centrally framed. Initially, the woman is on the left and the man is on the right; they turn, and at times the back of the man's head or the woman's head is seen in the center. In the top portion of the frame, star-shaped decorations and lights hang in the middle ground. Colorful red and green lights illuminate the scene from the top left and top right, casting a glow over the subjects. In the background, dark vertical lines are visible. The camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are slow dancing closely together. The man has voluminous, curly, shoulder-length blonde hair and is wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a white collared shirt, with a white boutonnière on his lapel. He is smiling and looking at the woman. The woman has long, straight blonde hair and is wearing a light-colored, possibly strapless, top or dress. A corsage is visible on her left wrist. She looks up at the man and smiles as they dance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit indoor setting, likely a dance or party, with a hazy atmosphere. The space is decorated with glittery, star-shaped ornaments and small string lights hanging from above. The environment is illuminated by soft, colorful lighting, with prominent red and green glows creating a festive ambiance. In the background, dark vertical lines, which appear to be cloth draped from the ceiling, are visible. A couple is slow dancing in the center of the space, turning gently under the decorations.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
