    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective framed by a dark red helmet visor at the periphery, the camera glides forward at a mid-level height through a dense underwater forest. The sandy seabed occupies the bottom of the frame in the foreground, where schools of small, glowing fish swim from the bottom left towards the middle ground. Occasionally, two gloved hands enter the frame from the bottom center in the immediate foreground. The middle ground is dominated by tall, vertical structures that extend from the bottom to the top of the frame, positioned across the scene from left to right. The camera navigates between these central structures, causing them to pass by on either side. In the background, more of these structures recede into the murky depths, with a large, dark, arch-like plant visible in the distant middle ground. The camera's viewpoint is positioned below the flat caps of the tall structures, creating a slightly upward-looking angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a first-person, underwater perspective of a bioluminescent alien forest. The scene is filled with tall, dark, trunk-like structures that have a porous texture and are adorned with glowing green, peanut-shaped organisms. These trunks support numerous flat, disc-shaped caps that are reddish-orange on top and have a lighter, honeycomb-like texture on their undersides. A large school of small, dark, fish-like creatures with glowing purple and green outlines swims throughout the environment. In the background, a very large, dark, bridge-like plant structure is situated between the mushroom trees. Other small life forms are visible, including glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures that float freely and pink rings attached to the trunks of some mushroom trees. The view is framed by the dark red border of a helmet or viewport, and occasionally, two gloved hands in an orange and black suit appear at the bottom of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, underwater alien forest. The environment is filled with towering, stalk-like structures that resemble giant mushrooms, featuring porous grey trunks and large, flat, reddish-brown caps. The scene is illuminated by various forms of bioluminescence: bright green, peanut-shaped growths cling to the trunks, schools of small fish with glowing purple and green bodies swim throughout the area, and glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures drift in the teal-colored water. The perspective glides forward through the sandy seabed, navigating between the massive stalks. The entire view is framed by a dark red border, suggesting a helmet's visor. A text overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"Loopy Longplays.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
