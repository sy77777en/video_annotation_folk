    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, the illuminated city skyline is positioned in the background, stretching across the horizontal center of the frame. In the foreground and middle ground, dark vertical posts of a guardrail occupy the bottom half of the frame, while overhead streetlights appear at the top. The camera, positioned above the foreground highway, moves laterally, causing the posts and lights to drift from the right side of the frame to the left, creating a parallax effect against the distant and relatively stationary cityscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a nighttime view of a highway in the foreground, where a person is riding a motorcycle towards the right side of the frame, while several cars move towards the left. In the background, there is a distant, illuminated city skyline, all seen from a moving perspective through a window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a nighttime view of the New York City skyline from across a body of water. The distant cityscape is densely packed with illuminated skyscrapers, with the One World Trade Center prominently visible. In the foreground, the drone flies parallel to a dark highway, where vertical posts of a guardrail and overhead streetlights pass by, creating a sense of lateral movement against the backdrop of the brightly lit city.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
