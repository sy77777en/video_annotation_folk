    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high, isometric angle. A heads-up display occupies the left third of the frame in the foreground. In the center middle ground, a squad of four figures and an individual in a black suit are positioned in a paved courtyard. A building with a dark roof is on the right, while another building and a set of stairs are visible in the background at the top of the frame. A small wheeled device rests in the bottom right. During the clip, the squad and the individual in black turn and begin walking towards the left side of the frame, while the camera remains stationary. The text in a command box on the HUD changes from \"EVACUATE\" to \"GOING.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixelated, isometric view, a squad of four figures stands in a group. Each figure is identically clad in a long, hooded, olive-green trench coat and holds a rifle. Red numbers, 1 through 4, are displayed above their respective heads, with the number \"1\" later changing to yellow. Two other men in a simple black uniforms stand nearby, facing the squad. As the squad turns 180 degrees and begins walking to the left, two additional figures in black follow them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows the environment in a three-quarters perspective. The scene is set in an outdoor, paved courtyard surrounded by brick buildings. One building has a dark, flat roof with vents, while another features a green, possibly grass-covered, roof. In the background, a set of stairs leads up. The reddish-brown ground is marked with yellow and black hazard stripes, white dashed lines, and circular grates. A group of four figures in green coats and two additional individuals in black suits stand in the open area. A small, wheeled device rests near the building on the right. A heads-up display (HUD) occupies the left side of the screen, showing character portraits, status bars, weapon icons, a minimap, and a command box with text that changes from \"EVACUATE\" to \"GOING.\" Red numbers from one to four are overlaid above the figures in green, with the number \"1\" changing to yellow later in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
