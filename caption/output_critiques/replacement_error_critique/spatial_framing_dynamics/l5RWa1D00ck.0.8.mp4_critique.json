    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man initially stands in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the background, trees are visible on the left, and a large building is on the right. The man then turns his body to his left, moving toward the center-right of the frame, and gestures with his hands. As this happens, a vintage bus enters from the left and stops in the left background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man, appearing to be in his late 20s or early 30s, stands outdoors at dusk. He has dark, neatly styled hair parted on the side and is clean-shaven. He wears a dark jacket over a white collared shirt that is unbuttoned at the top. Initially looking forward with a faint smile, he then turns to his side and gestures with his hands open and palms up. In the background, two vintage, light-colored buses with rounded fronts are parked.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in an outdoor setting, characterized by a dimly lit, urban environment during twilight. The approach of night is evident. The ground is paved and appears slightly uneven, with scattered patches of gravel. In the background, two vintage yellow buses are parked, their rounded shapes and retro designs contrasting with the stark, angular lines of a nearby building, which has a smooth, white exterior. The surrounding area is lined with sparse trees, their silhouettes dark against the fading light. The overall atmosphere is quiet, with a sense of stillness, as the camera captures the scene from a detached perspective, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
