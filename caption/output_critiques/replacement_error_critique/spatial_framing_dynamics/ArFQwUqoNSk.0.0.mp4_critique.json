    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot from behind a woman positioned in the center of the frame. In the background, a dark shelving unit filled with media cases is visible, with a piece of audio equipment in the middle ground to the left of the woman. The camera smoothly pans to the right, keeping the woman centered while transitioning to a view of her right profile. As the camera moves, a framed picture on the wall enters the frame in the right background. The shot remains a close-up at the subject's level throughout the pan.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with shoulder-length brown hair, featuring lighter highlights and bangs, is shown first from behind and then in profile. She wears large, black over-ear headphones with the \"Sennheiser\" brand name visible on the left earcup, which also has a letter \"R\" on it. Her expression is focused and serious as she looks forward, seemingly concentrating on something off-screen. She is wearing a striped shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit room with cool-toned lighting. A woman with shoulder-length brown hair is seen wearing a pair of black over-ear headphones. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise gradually revealing her profile. In the background, a dark shelving unit is densely packed with what appear to be CD or DVD cases. To the left, a piece of audio equipment with a small, illuminated blue screen is visible. As the camera moves, a framed picture with a light, abstract image becomes visible on the neutral-colored wall behind her.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
