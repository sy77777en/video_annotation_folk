    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot with no main subject, presented as a close-up. Green, unripe wheat stalks are positioned in the foreground and extend into the middle ground, occupying the lower two-thirds of the frame from the bottom edge upwards. A line of dark green trees and rolling hills is visible in the background, forming a horizontal band above the wheat field and below the main expanse of the sky. The sky fills the top third of the frame, featuring dark clouds towards the top and a band of lighter, warm-toned light along the horizon, directly above the distant trees. The camera is positioned low, approximately at the height of the foreground wheat stalks, and the framing remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a landscape scenery shot, featuring a vast field of green, unripe wheat stalks under a cloudy sky tinged with the warm hues of either dawn or dusk. There is no main subject because the focus is on the expansive natural environment and the atmospheric quality of the light, emphasizing the scale of the wheat field rather than a specific object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a field of green wheat stalks, with their heads visible, extending towards a line of dark green trees and rolling hills in the distant background. The sky above is overcast with dark clouds, but a band of lighter, warm-toned light is visible along the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The wheat in the middle ground is in focus and sharp, while the foreground and background elements are slightly blurred. The scene is still, with no apparent movement in the wheat.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",
