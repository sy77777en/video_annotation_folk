    "pre_caption": "This full shot is framed from a high angle, looking down at a large, open cardboard box positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. The box rests on an off-white, textured surface that extends from the foreground to the middle ground. A dark, out-of-focus shape is visible in the foreground on the far right, while a portion of a dark wooden object is in the background on the top right. The box remains stationary, but a circular beam of light moves across the scene, starting on the top right flap and shifting down towards the bottom right flap and the surface below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, open cardboard box with flaps spread outward, positioned centrally. The box is made of brown corrugated cardboard, and its interior appears dark, suggesting depth. A strong flashlight casts light onto the box's surface, highlighting its texture. The box remains stationary throughout the video, with no visible changes or additional subjects.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a brown cardboard box rests on an off-white, textured surface. The box is open, with its top flaps folded outward, revealing an interior that is a solid, non-reflective black. A flashlight casts a strong light onto the box, while another light source from off-camera illuminates the scene. The light from the flashlight moves over the box, creating a bright, circular reflection on the flaps and the surface below it. A dark wooden object, possibly a piece of furniture, is partially visible in the shadowed background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
