    "pre_caption": "This video, shot from a first-person POV at the subjects' level, presents a wide view of a park, with the camera following a group of four people from behind. The subjects occupy the middle ground, with a man in a denim jacket on the right, a woman in a teal skirt in the center, and another man and woman to their left. They walk forward along a wooden boardwalk that extends from the foreground into the middle ground. The scene is framed by lush green trees on the top, left, and right, occupying the foreground and middle ground. To the left of the boardwalk, a rocky animal enclosure with a small body of water is situated in the middle ground. A dirt path runs parallel to the boardwalk in the right middle ground. In the background, a light blue roller coaster track is visible above the trees on the left. The camera moves steadily forward, maintaining a consistent distance from the group as they walk away from the viewer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video, shot from a first-person perspective, follows a group of four young adults in a park. The two central figures are a man and a woman walking away from the camera. The man, on the right, has short dark hair and wears a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt and black pants. The woman next to him has shoulder-length brown hair and is dressed in a beige long-sleeved top and a long teal skirt, carrying a large navy and white tote bag. To their left, another man with short, dyed-blond hair wears a white shirt, a brown vest, and dark green pants while holding a white plastic bag. On the far left, a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair stands wearing a blue denim jacket and grey pants, holding a green tote bag and looking at her phone. Three of the individuals are clearly wearing white face masks, while it is unclear if the woman with the large navy and white tote bag is also wearing one.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves forward along a wooden boardwalk in an outdoor park-like setting during the daytime. The path is lined with lush green trees, and to the left, a railing with glass panels overlooks a rocky enclosure containing a small body of water. In the background, a light blue roller coaster track is visible above the trees. Several people wearing face masks are seen walking along the boardwalk and an adjacent dirt path.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video, shot from a first-person POV, shows a wide view of a park. The camera follows a man and a woman from behind as they walk forward, showing only their upper bodies from the knees up, leaving more content for the park's scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
