    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a shattered, blue, crystalline surface occupying the foreground and filling the frame. A circular opening is positioned in the center of this surface, acting as a middle ground element that reveals a lighter blue, slightly blurred background. A yellow-orange frog then emerges from the background, moving through this central opening towards the foreground. As the frog appears, the shot transitions to a full shot of the frog, which remains centered within the frame as it moves through the opening. The camera is positioned below the frog.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A yellow-orange frog with large, dark eyes and slender limbs emerges through a circular opening in a shattered, blue, crystalline surface, moving towards the inside of the opening. The frog's skin has a slightly mottled texture, and its limbs are splayed as it navigates the opening.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A circular opening, framed by jagged, radiating shards of a translucent, blue, crystalline material, reveals a lighter blue, slightly blurred background. The crystalline surface around the hole reflects an external light source, such as moonlight, casting a blue glow that highlights its fractured texture. A small, yellowish-orange frog with large, dark eyes emerges through the opening.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned below the subject.",
