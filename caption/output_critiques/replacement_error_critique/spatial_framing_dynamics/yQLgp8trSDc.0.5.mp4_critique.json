    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of an elderly man positioned in the center of the frame. As the camera pulls back, the partial upper bodies of two figures emerge in the foreground, one on the left and one on the right, framing the elderly man who is now situated in the middle ground. The blades of swords, held by the foreground figures, are visible horizontally across the lower-center of the frame. A dimly lit interior with wooden structures occupies the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout this movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features an elderly man with white hair tied up in a bun, secured with a pin, and long eyebrows. He has a long white beard and is wearing a traditional Chinese robe. Positioned centrally and facing forward with a serious expression, the camera initially focuses on him in a medium close-up shot. As the camera zooms out, two other people appear in the foreground, partially visible from behind. They frame the elderly man in the gap between them. The two individuals in the foreground are dressed in dark traditional Chinese robes and appear to have swords, with sword visible on the back of one person. Their upper bodies and partial heads are visible, suggesting they are facing the elderly man. The scene creates a sense of focus on the elderly man, framed by the two figures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors, featuring a dimly lit room with wooden elements and traditional decor. The environment is naturally lit, with a flickering candle visible in the background, enhancing the room's warm, muted tones. Notable visual elements include a figure with distinctive white hair and a long beard, positioned centrally, adding a focal point to the scene. In the foreground, two individuals are partially visible, holding swords that glint under the ambient light, indicating a tense atmosphere. Decorative elements, including hanging tassels, contribute to the ambiance, conveying a sense of historical or cultural significance and enhancing the scene's immersive quality.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features three people, with the camera shooting from behind two of them. It begins with a medium close-up shot of an elderly man with white hair and a beard. As the camera pulls, half of the upper bodies and partial heads of two people appear in the foreground, framing the white-haired man in the gap between them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
