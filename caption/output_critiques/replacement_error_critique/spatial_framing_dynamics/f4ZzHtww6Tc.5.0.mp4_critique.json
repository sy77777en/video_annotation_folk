    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, capturing a skateboarder's lower body in the center-right middle ground. A concrete ditch fills the foreground, while a grassy bank with a small bush on the left extends across the middle ground. A silver SUV is positioned in the top-left background. As the skateboarder reaches the top of the bank, the camera tilts upward, reframing him in a full shot in the center of the frame. In this final position, he balances in the middle ground, with a black Jeep and a building now visible in the background behind him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a man with extensive tattoos on both arms as he skateboards. He is wearing a blue, short-sleeved, collared shirt, dark pants, and black and white sneakers. Initially, the view is on his lower body and the skateboard, which has a dark top surface. The perspective then shifts to show his full figure, revealing a light-colored baseball cap worn forwards on his head. He balances on the edge of a concrete structure before jumping off, after which the focus moves to his upper body.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene during the daytime, featuring a dark concrete drainage ditch with sloped sides. A grassy bank with green foliage lines the top edge of the ditch. In the background, a parking lot contains several vehicles, including a silver SUV and a black Jeep. Behind these vehicles, a building with a blue facade has a sign with the word \"Donations\" visible. Bright sunlight casts a prominent, dark shadow into the concrete channel.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot focusing on a boy's lower body as he skateboards up a small slope. As he reaches the top, the camera tilts up and zooms in slightly, briefly transitioning to a full-body view. When the boy jumps down the slope, the camera captures only his upper body in a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
