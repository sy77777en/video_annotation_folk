    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot filmed at the subject's level, a blue car occupies the foreground, positioned on the right side of the frame. The camera maintains a fixed position relative to this car. On the left, a road extends from the foreground into the background, accompanied by a wooden fence and utility poles. A white police car is visible in the background, positioned in the center-left of the frame. As the blue car travels forward, the background scenery moves from right to left, while the police car remains in the background, maintaining its relative distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A metallic blue car is shown from a level angle. The camera is positioned at the right front of the car, highlighting its front and side view. The car features a thin, double gold pinstripe that follows the contours of its body and wheel well. It has a silver wheel with a black tire, a black side mirror, and an orange side marker light on the side of the car. In the background, a white police sedan with a flashing red light on its roof is visible on the same road.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted low on the right front side of a metallic blue sports car, the perspective remains fixed as the vehicle travels along a winding, two-lane road during the daytime. The car, which features gold pinstriping, moves under a clear, sunny sky through a hilly landscape covered in green brush and trees. A wooden fence and utility poles run parallel to the grey asphalt road, which is marked with a solid white line. As the car proceeds, a white vehicle with a red light on its roof approaches from the rear in the same lane. The lighting on the blue car's body shifts as it passes through patches of sunlight and shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
