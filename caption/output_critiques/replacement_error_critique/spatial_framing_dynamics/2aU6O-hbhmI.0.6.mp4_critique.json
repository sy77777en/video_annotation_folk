    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, captured from a high-angle perspective. The shot begins with the camera descending and rotating rapidly, creating a disorienting, blurred view of the city below in the bottom right and the sunset sky in the top left. As the camera dives, it swoops over a large construction site that moves from the background to occupy the foreground and center of the frame. A tall red crane is briefly visible on the left side of the frame, while partially constructed buildings in the middle ground and foreground rush past. The camera's fast, continuous movement prevents any single element from remaining static, with the entire scene shifting dynamically from a high-angle, top-down view to a more level, though still elevated, perspective flying through the construction area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a fast-paced, disorienting aerial cityscape scenery shot, capturing a dense urban environment at dusk. The sky is painted with soft orange and pink hues above a skyline of illuminated skyscrapers and buildings under construction. A large construction site is a prominent feature below, characterized by a tall red crane, exposed earth, and the skeletal frames of new structures. The rapid, swooping motion of the camera creates significant motion blur, transforming city lights into dynamic streaks and preventing any single building or object from becoming the main subject. Instead, the focus is on conveying the exhilarating and vertiginous experience of flying through the vast, developing urban landscape, emphasizing the scale and energy of the environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a fast-paced, swooping flight over a large urban construction site at dusk. The sky is painted with hues of orange and pink from the setting sun. The drone dives and maneuvers around partially constructed high-rise buildings and a prominent red construction crane. In the background, the lights of the surrounding city skyline begin to twinkle against the fading light. The ground below is a mix of dirt, building materials, and the foundations of new structures.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
