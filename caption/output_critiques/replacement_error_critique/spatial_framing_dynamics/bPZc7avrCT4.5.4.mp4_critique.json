    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subject's level, a woman stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In front of her, a container is positioned in the center-foreground on an asphalt road. A large volume of water erupts upwards and outwards from the container, expanding to fill the center of the frame and momentarily obscuring the woman as the droplets spread across the foreground and middle ground. In the background, trees are visible across the top of the frame, with a dumpster and a car located in the right-middle ground. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with long, dark brown hair, wearing a grey long-sleeved sweatshirt and dark leggings, stands behind a brownish-orange container with a yellow rim. A large volume of water erupts upwards from the container, creating a wide splash of droplets that momentarily obscures her. The woman appears to grimace as the water begins to splash.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on an asphalt road in a suburban area, bordered by a concrete curb. In the background, a line of evergreen and bare-branched trees stands before a partially visible building. Further down the road, a green dumpster and a parked car are visible under a sunny sky. In the foreground, a large volume of water splashes upwards and outwards from a container placed on the pavement, with a person in a grey sweatshirt standing behind the eruption.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
