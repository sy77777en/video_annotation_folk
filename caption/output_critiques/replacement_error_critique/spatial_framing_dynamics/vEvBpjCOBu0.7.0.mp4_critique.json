    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with a large, blurry, light-gray object occupying the entire foreground and left side of the frame. This object moves to the left, revealing a full shot of a testing apparatus positioned in the center of the frame against a black background. A tall stack of black weights is suspended in the center, extending from the middle to the top of the frame. Below the weights, a transparent sheet on a black base sits in the center-bottom of the frame in the middle ground. A person in a white coat is partially visible on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground. A text overlay \"(27)\" is present in the bottom-left corner of the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a blurry view that resolves to reveal a testing apparatus, initially obscured by the back of another scientist observing the setup. The apparatus features a tall stack of approximately a dozen shiny, black, rectangular weights suspended by two thin vertical metal rods. These rods are supported by two thicker, horizontal, textured metal bars that rest on a frame. Positioned directly beneath the stack is a clear, transparent, rectangular sheet resting on a black base. The bottom-most weight has a small, pointed tip aimed at the center of the transparent sheet. To the right, a person wearing a white lab coat stands partially in view, also observing the setup.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set against a solid black background, the scene focuses on a mechanical testing apparatus. A stack of glossy, black rectangular weights is suspended by two vertical metal rods. Below the weights, a transparent, flat sheet rests on two horizontal, textured metal bars, all supported by a black base. A small, pointed tip extends from the bottom of the weight stack, aimed at the center of the transparent sheet. To the right of the apparatus, a figure in white is partially visible. The video begins with a blurry view that appears to show the back of another scientist observing the setup, which then resolves to reveal the entire apparatus. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the number \"(27)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
