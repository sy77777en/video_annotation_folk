    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a minimalist scene from a side-view perspective. Initially, a hand-drawn figure on a unicycle is positioned in the middle ground on the center-right, situated on a curved black line. In the top-left, the letter 'P' and another curved line are also visible in the middle ground. The unicyclist travels from right to left along its path, and the camera pans left to follow the movement, keeping the figure near the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A minimalist, hand-drawn figure in black ink, wearing a white hat with a black dot on top, is depicted riding a unicycle, which is also rendered as a simple black line drawing on a curved path. A few small dots in blue, green, and red are visible near the figure. In the upper left portion of the scene, the letter 'P' is hand-drawn in black ink above a separate curved line.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, shows a minimalist, abstract environment. Against a solid light gray background, several disconnected, hand-drawn black lines form a series of curved, undulating paths. In the upper left corner, a hand-drawn letter 'P', a rest symbol, and the number \"10\" are visible. A small, cartoonish figure on a bicycle travels along these black lines.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
