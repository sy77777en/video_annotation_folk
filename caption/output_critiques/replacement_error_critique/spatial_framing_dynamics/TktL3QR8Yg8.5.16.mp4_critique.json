    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a first-person point-of-view close-up, where a pair of hands occupies the foreground in the bottom half of the frame. These hands interact with a circular dial lock positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, set against a dark, fragmented background. The hands then exit the frame, leaving the dial lock as the central focus. The dark grey, petal-like segments of the lock, located in the middle ground, then flip over to reveal a gold surface. As this happens, a colorful, stained-glass pattern is revealed in the background behind the fragmented pieces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a pair of light-skinned hands in a grey knitted sweater manipulates a dark red circular dial. This dial is the center of a larger, ornate, flower-shaped mechanism made of dark grey metal arranged in petal-like segments with swirling filigree patterns. After the hands are removed, each metal segment swiftly flips over, revealing the original bright, reflective gold color on its reverse side, while the central red dial remains unchanged.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, focuses on a pair of hands interacting with a complex, circular mechanism. The device has a reddish-brown center with several small holes, encircled by petal-shaped metal pieces. These pieces, initially a dark, gunmetal gray, quickly flip to reveal their original gold color on the reverse side. Thin, curved wires extend from the perimeter of the central disc, which remains reddish-brown. This central object is set against a dark, chaotic background of sharp, fragmented pieces, with a few small, colored lights visible. As the petal-shaped pieces reveal their gold color, a colorful, stained-glass-like pattern is revealed behind the fragments.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is filmed in first-person POV and shows a close-up of a pair of hands operating a dark red circular dial lock. The hands then exit the frame, showing the circular dial lock changing.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
