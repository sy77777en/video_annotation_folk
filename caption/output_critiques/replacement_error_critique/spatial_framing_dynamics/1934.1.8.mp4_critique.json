    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, features a large, white, camera-like machine occupying the center-left of the frame in the middle ground. To the right of the machine, a person in a white suit stands in the middle ground, positioned on the right side of the frame. The scene is set against a uniform white background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, white, camera-like machine with a rectangular body is positioned centrally. It features a large, dark, circular lens recessed in the center, a smaller secondary lens on a cylindrical mount to the top left, and a small, square viewfinder to the top right. On the right side of the frame stands a man in a medium-full body view, wearing a tight-fitting white suit with two black dots on the chest and a third dot on his skullcap. He wears white gloves and a white skullcap with white goggles pushed up on his forehead, revealing a face with orange makeup, pronounced white eyebrows, and an open mouth. He is raising his hand to move the white goggles from his forehead to his eyes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark, all-white room, a large, box-shaped white camera is mounted on a pedestal. The camera features a prominent, dark central lens, a smaller secondary lens on the left side of the screen, and a square viewfinder at the top right of the frame. To the right, a person in a white, full-body suit, complete with white gloves and goggles, stands with their hands initially near a silver-colored crank attached to the camera's side. The person then raises their hands to adjust their goggles from their forehead to their eyes. Their face is painted with orange makeup, and the background is a uniform white, creating a minimalist and stylized environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
